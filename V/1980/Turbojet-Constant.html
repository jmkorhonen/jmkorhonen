</p>

<p>
— technological revolution defined in the book only in terms of a community of technological practitioners; “has nothing to do with social significance, economic impact, or tawdry advertising.”<br>
“A technological revolution occurs when a community of practitioners embraces a new tradition, whether that community consists of three little old wine makers or of every major aero-engine manufacturer in the world.”
</p>

<p>
— large numbers of patents are characteristics of a recently initiated new normal technology<br>
— even after the new system is working quite well, there are a lot of second-generation and interface problems that provide major challenges of normal technology<br>
NOTE: this might tie with Frenken’s discussion about dominant designs and core/peripheral divide.
</p>

<p>
21
</p>

<p>
— Edison’s search for a practicable incandescent light filament embodied Campbell’s conception of a “nested hierarchy” of variation-retention processes: Edison’s search was random only at the level of filament materials, but highly structured at the hierarchically higher level of systems design.<br>
NOTE: nested-hierarchical nature of problem decomposition = Herbert Simon
</p>

<p>
28
</p>

<p>
— a conflation of technological and economic factors can be dysfunctional: Constant claims that “those men who tried to design gas turbine aircraft engines to meet the economic criteria defined by conventional piston technology were unsuccessful, while those men whose inventive processes were much more closely coupled to scientific insight than to overt economic considerations created the turbojet revolution.”
</p>

<p>
82
</p>

<p>
— the influence of steam turbine work was not wholly positive to gas turbine development: the potentially thrust-producing exhaust was regarded strictly as waste before 1930<br>
NOTE: Disagree somewhat!
</p>

<p>
93
</p>

<p>
— the definitive Armengaud-Lemale turbine (constructed 1905-6) was woefully inefficient (3.9 lb of petrol per brake-horsepower hour, compared to 0.5 for contemporary piston engines)<br>
— major reason: lack of appropriate high-temperature materials for nozzles and turbines<br>
— hollow blades with water cooling used!<br>
— further experiments abandoned when René Armengaud died in 1909<br>
— Société des Turbomoteurs did use the experience gained in order to develop a “paraffin turbine” naval torpedo (injected and ignited paraffin in a combustion chamber to increase the temperature and hence the pressure of the normal compressed air used in torpedoes)
</p>

<p>
95
</p>

<p>
— same problem plagued GE’s turbine work by Moss:<br>
“All early General Electric gas-turbine work was conducted with temperatures possible with materials then known… So the temperatures were kept low by air excess or water injection, both resulting in inefficiencies. No way then seemed open to do better, and so the gas-turbine part of the research was postponed, but with vigorous commercial work on centrifugal compressors.” (Moss, quoted in [Constant1980:95]
</p>

<p>
96
</p>

<p>
— another gas turbine enthusiast at GE, Glenn B. Warren, did a detailed design study for a 10,000 kW gas turbine during 1921-22. Concluded that GE did not then have an adequate technological base, either in high-temperature materials or in compressor design, to build a successful gas turbine. 
</p>

<p>
— An Austrian engineer Adolf Vogt, in cooperation with S.A. des Ateliers Carel Freres, Ghent, Belgium (builders of diesel and steam engines), designed and built experimental engines during 1904-5. <br>
— Built a constant-pressure gas turbine in 1905, but could not evade temperature limitation
</p>

<br>

<p>
97
</p>

<p>
— in 1900, “hundreds of gas turbine proposals”<br>
— only a few were developed<br>
— only those of Holzwarth, Armengaud and Lemale, and Moss were developed seriously.<br>
“The first gas turbine revolution proved largely abortive. Ironically, its most successful progeny were centrifugal superchargers and turbosuperchargers for piston aircraft engines.”
</p>

<p>
SEE ALSO NOTE 95, p. 288:<br>
Richardson (1911, The Evolution of the Parsons Steam Turbine) wrote:<br>
“The success of the steam turbine has encouraged the engineering profession to investigate the problems of the internal combustion turbine which would dispense with boilers, and many auxiliary engines. One of the seemingly insurmountable difficulties is that the high temperatures of the gas would burn the turbine blades. It was suggested that this temperature might be reduced by the expansion of the flame in a divergent nozzle. Mr. Parsons and Mr. Stoney made some experiments with a flame flowing under pressure through such a divergent nozzle. A platinum wire was placed at each end, and the temperature effect on it observed through glass windows. It was found that the two wires attained almost identical temperatures, both showing a bright red heat. The gases had cooled on expansion, but the heat was restored by the impact of the gas against the wire. The same result would occur with blades, and thus there seems an insurmountable obstacle to the practical success of an internal combustion turbine.”
</p>

<p>
— quotes from the editors, “The Efficiency of the Gas Turbine”, Engineering 92 (1911):706, regarding Holzwarth’s gas turbine:<br>
… “We all know that  a gas-turbine can be built to run, and also that a good gas-turbine would have enormous advantages…”
</p>

<br>

<p>
99
</p>

<p>
— claims that the turbojet was in no sense an obvious, logical, or determinant development of any set of prior technological traditions. “Instead, the turbojet derived directly from presumptive anomaly based upon aerodynamic theory.”
</p>

<p>
108
</p>

<p>
NOTE: the problem with Constant’s explanation — that developments in aerodynamics, particularly in streamlining, created a presumptive anomaly that spurred the development of the turbojet engine is that the developments happened simultaneously or even after Whittle and others had started to think seriously about turbojet engines. It certainly had an effect, though.<br>
Also reinforced by the fact that Griffith of RAE was developing a turboprop — specifically for lower speeds!
</p>

<p>
126
</p>

<p>
— about engine valve design: sodium valve cooling, using hollow valves, was patented by Heron in 1922<br>
— type-K Wright “Whirlwind” radial was the first production engine to use sodium-cooled valves in about 1926<br>
“After 1930, virtually every high-powered poppet-valve aircraft engine used some form of internally cooled valve.”
</p>

<p>
127
</p>

<p>
— sleeve-valve engine was first developed as a hand-built engine by Bristol; Firth Vickers developed a centrifugal casting process to produce sleeves of consistent quality. The program required an extensive materials investigation, testing “In all some fifty to sixty varying compositions associated with approximately 1,100 heat treatment procedures were investigated and tested both metallographically and physically before the final production sleeve was produced.” [20]<br>
— first series-production of sleeve-valve engines began in 1936<br>
— when Whittle approached Bristol in 1930, they decided they did not have the manpower or the capital for the requisite R&amp;D effort
</p>

<p>
146
</p>

<p>
NOTE: discusses Brown Boveri gas turbines: first developed almost accidentally at Sun Oil Company in Philadelphia, when a turbocompressor ordered to help in a Houndry catalytic oil cracking process (the process required considerable amounts of compressed air) was made to run with oil instead of furnace gases. <br>
“Under the leadership of Adolf Meyer, Brown Boveri immediately constructed a true internal combustion gas turbine.”<br>
— used in Neuchatel for electricity, for locomotive as well<br>
HOX: What are the materials used? Where did they come from? 
</p>

<p>
See Seippel, Claude<br>
Gas Turbines in Our Century<br>
Trans. ASME 75 (1953):122
</p>

<p>
— Others built gas turbines as well; probably the best of these was a result of joint effort by Jacob Ackeret and Curt Keller, director of research of the Escher-Wyss concern. E-W completed first AK turbine in summer 1939. Used to produce electricity, about a dozen in central-station use by 1966. 
</p>

<p>
147
</p>

<p>
— Also Sulzer of Switzerland investigated 3 distinct types of engines beginning in 1936<br>
— Lysholm in Sweden began investigations of internal combustion gas turbines in 1928, designed large number of different types between 1928 and 32. In 1932,   Bofors undertook actual construction of an unit intended as a turboprop. Under test between 1933 and 35. Severe probelms with surging, different (Roots type) compressor used. Tested during the war. 
</p>

<p>
— Air-cooled blades: <br>
“Christian Lorenzen of Berlin began experiments on axial turbines with internally air-cooled blades shortly before 1930.His hollow-blade design apparently followed a Brown Boveri patent used under licence. (Adolf Meyer: Recent Developments in Gas Turbines, Mechanical engineering 69 (1947), 273-77.)<br>
— Lorenzen was a pioneer in both automobiles and aeronautics<br>
148<br>
“In his experiments, Lorenzen encountered blade warping as a result of overheating. He therefore began work on air-cooled blades. By 1930, he had not only done considerable work on the air-cooled turbine, but had also designed a complete internal combustion gas turbine around it. The cooling air was introduced into the hub of the turbine and whirled outward through the blades, cooling the blades and compressing the air at the same time. At its exit from the blades, the air was fed to a combustion chamber, which exhausted through the turbine. The Lorenzen gas turbine proved impracticable, probably because of internal flow losses, but his work on air-cooled blades proved invaluable to the Germans during the Second World War.”<br>

<p>
— 4 men independently caused the “emergence” of the turbojet:<br>
Frank Whittle, Hans von Ohain, Herbert Wagner, and Helmut Schelp (all 3 GER)
</p>

<br>
<br>

<p>
Gas turbine pioneers (from Constant 1980)<br>
1939 - Jendrassik, George<br>
Budapest<br>
“….tested an internal combustion gas turbine of his own design built with the assistance of the Royal Hungarian Ministry for Industrial Affairs. The Jendrassik compressor used ten axial stages to get a 2:1 pressure ration and employed a seven-stage axial turbine. Although the Jendrassik turbine seems to have given acceptable efficiency when tested, its design apparently was not up to the standards set in Switzerland. In any event, the war caused an end to its development.” [Constant1980:148]; original source <br>
The Jendrassik Combustion Turbine, Engineering, 1939, 186-88
</p>

<p>
1931 - Cukor, Colomar<br>
Hungary<br>
“…had designed a sulfur dioxide closed-cycle turbine for an automobile in 1931, but there is no evidence of its ever having been constructed.” [Constant1980:148]
</p>

<p>
Early 1930s - Bertin, G.<br>
Paris<br>
“…reportedly designed and built a small turboprop in Paris in the early thirties…” [Constant1980:148]
</p>

<p>
1933 - Belluzzo, Giuseppe<br>
Royal School for Engineers, Rome<br>
“…allegedly constructed and tested an internal combustion turbine in 1933.” [Constant1980:148]
