<p>
II-2
</p>

<p>
The primary effort for the remainder of the mission was directed towards establishing the various procedures required for the many non-standard operations, i.e., CM battery charging from LM batteries, CM LiOH cannister use on LM environmental control system, no-optics alignment for maneuvers, water transfer from CM and portable life support system tanks to LM tanks, Service Module jettison, and many others. 
</p>

<p>
The consumable situation continued to improve and stabilize to the point where it was feasible to leave the LM guidance system powered up until the descent engine maneuver with every expectation that the systems could easily be managed to stay within the consumable quantities available. This proved to be the case and after the major maneuver at 79+30 GET, the usage rates had dropped to be clearly compatible with the landing time. Sufficient workaround procedures had also been established to provide margins should there be subsequent loss of batteries, water tanks, or oxygen tanks in the LM. 
</p>

<p>
There were several options available for the maneuver at 79+30 GET (2 hours after lunar flyby). These included jettisoning the Service Module before the burn and burning the descent engine to near depletion. The consumables status did not justify going to either of these extremes, and the maneuver was targeted to reduce tha landing time from 152 hours GET to 142 hours GET and change the landing area from the Indian Ocean to the Pacific Ocean. This allowed a comfortable propellant margin for future midcourse corrections. 
</p>

<p>
The transearth coast portion was devoted to getting the ground developed procedures up to the crew at the proper times and in executing two small midcourse adjustments to the trajectory. The consumable status had continued as predicted, and the LM was powered up early to help warm up the crew and allow them a better chance to rest. This early power up also allowed a LM Primary Guidance and Navigation System alignment which was later transferred to the CM Guidance System saving several minutes in the critical preentry phase. 
</p>

<p>
The SM was jettisoned about 4-1/2 hours prior to entry interface (EI) and the CM power up procedure started at EI - 2 hours 30 minutes. The CM Guidance System was fine aligned and the LM was jettisoned at EI - 1 hour. All CM Systems functioned properly during entry and the landing could be seen from TV on board the recovery ship. The crew were recovered in 45 minutes and were in good condition. 
</p>

<p>
III-14
</p>

<p>
- first mention of SPS engine not being used
</p>

<p>
At 56+48, the Flight Dynamics team was advised to initiate all of the return-to-earth planning based on going around the moon, and assuming use of the LM descent engine and LM RCS, and that we would not use the SPS except as a last ditch effort.
</p>

<p>
III-17
</p>

<p>
Now our attention, in the period between 59 and 60 hours, was focused on the consumables needed for such a return which involved a total trip time of approxumately 152 hours. At about 59+50, the LM water was the critical item. The initial water usage rate with the LM Primary Guidance and Navigation System (PNGS) up would have resulted in H2O depletion in 34 hours; i.e., at 94:00. Although this high usage rate of H2O was to some degree charged to the initial load of cooling the entire loop down (including the fluid), it was severe enough to force us to entertain how to keep an alignment up with the LM Abort Guidance System (AGS) while powering the PGNS down until it was needed again. The power was projected to last 67 hours; i.e., 127+00 GET, at the current rate of 35 amps. 
</p>

<p>
III-19
</p>

<p>
By 63+20, the current output was 27 amps, and the usage rates had settled down to something more like nominal for the power load. The projected profiles were coming more in line with keeping the PNGS up to PC+2 time (79+30) and then powering down to a life support/comm mode after the maneuver. Midcourse maneuvers were budgeted at 104 and 140.
</p>

<p>
Projected ahead at an average 25.6 amps:
</p>

<p>
EPS would last to 142+00 GET<br>
H2O would last to 138+30 GET<br>
O2 would last to 233+00 GET
</p>

<p>
Powering to 15.4 amps after 80 hours:
</p>

<p>
EPS would last to 163+00 GET<br>
H2O would last to 155+00 GET
</p>

<p>
This picture gradually began to improve. At about 63+32, the consumable of concern was the CO2 removal, and people were already working on the problem of how to use the CSM cannisters. 
</p>

<p>
III-20
</p>

<p>
...
</p>

<p>
SPAN was already considering the pros and cons of jettisoning the service module and burning most of the descent fuel to get an earlier landing time of 118+00. The primary concern was the cold environment to which the heat shield and CMRCS would be exposed and the fairly small amount of descent fuel that would be left. The White Team's recommendation based<br>
III-21<br>
on their understanding of the current state of the relative advantages of dropping or keeping the Service Module was to keep the Service Module. There was no real urgency to decide that issue at that particular time and, along with the descent propellant budgets, this subject was highlighted for consideration by the next shift. 
</p>

<p>
...
</p>

<p>
By 67 hours, the LM spacecraft lifetime projections were reasonable and were based on the following plan.
</p>

<p>
Stay powered up until PC+2 at 79+30 GET.<br>
Then power down to about 15 to 18 amps.<br>
Two hours of power up time for each MCC (at 104+00 and 140+00 GET).
</p>

<p>
The following issues were identified as open.
</p>

<p>
<ol type="1" start="1">
<li>Selection of return time option with question of jettisoning the SM.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
<ol type="1" start="2">
<li>Find a suitable method for checking or realigning prior to the burn.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
<ol type="1" start="3">
<li>The CSM/LM umbilical procedure had to be finalized and available, but should be implemented with all 3 crewmen awake.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>

<li>Consumables studies need to be refined.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
<ol type="1" start="5">
<li>Need a procedure for CO2 removal with CSM cannisters.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
<ol type="1" start="6">

</ol>
</p>

<p>

<li>Need procedure for moving rendezvous radar out for using AOT.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
<ol type="1" start="8">
<li>Possibility of transferring PLSS H2O to LM ascent H2O tanks.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
...
</p>

<p>
III-22
</p>

<p>
At 68+18 ... SPAN reported that the procedure to use CSM LiOH cannisters in the LM was in preliminary form and being reviewed by all areas.
</p>

<p>
III-23
</p>

<p>
Other options available at this point were as follows:
</p>

<p>
<ol type="1" start="1">
<li>(PC+2 h abort burn with SPS for 118+00 landing in the Pacific); ...rejected unanimously as being too risky since no data was available as to the structural integrity of the Service Module. This option was put into the category of "last ditch".</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
<ol type="1" start="2">
<li>(SM jettison and descent engine PC+2 burn for 118+00 Pacific landing): This plan was rejected because it would require burning the descent engine very close to depletion, would require uncovering the heat shield of the CM for many hours and thereby reaching the hazy area of thermal limits, and because of the uncertain alignment of the LM platform could require a very large midcourse correction to get back into the corridor.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
<ol type="1" start="3">
<li>Do nothing and perform a midcourse correction sometime after pericynthion in order to get back on the free return corridor for a landing at 153+00 in the Indian Ocean. This plan was unacceptable since such a trip time would push the LM consumables very close to depletion. In fact, it was not clear at this point that there was enough water in the LM to fly that long. This option would also require landing in an area with a relatively poor recovery posture. (Although the Recovery Coordinator and DOD had established that there were 4 U.S. destroyers in the area and retrieval equipment could be flown in before splash.)</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
<ol type="1" start="4">
<li>A final option was not discussed but was available, and the crew was already updated (at 59+00) with a pad to make the burn if required. This option was a DPS burn to very near depletion with the SM still attached.</li>
</ol>
III-24<br>
This option would provide a landing at 133+00 in the Atlantic Ocean. This plan had obvious drawbacks, but was given to the crew in the case of a loss of communications and consumables usage too high to stay on the free return.  
</p>

<p>
III-27
</p>

<p>
Crew changeover to the MAroon Team was completed by 82+00, and the LM was powered down to about 12 amps at 82+37. The consumables status (except for LiOH) for the first time was clearly compatible with the landing time including reasonable margins. The consumable status at 84+00 was:
</p>

<p>
Total usable<br>
Water= 205.8#<br>
O2 = 43.25<br>
Batteries = 1454 amp hours
</p>

<p>
Rate<br>
Water = 3.0#/hr<br>
O2 .25#/hr<br>
Batteries 12.1 amp
</p>

<p>
GET Depletion at Present Rate<br>
Water 152+36<br>
O2 257+00<br>
Batteries 204+00
</p>

<p>
... 
</p>

<p>
The SURGEON recommended extending the CO2 partial pressure limit from 7.6 mm to 15.0 mm. This was accepted and it was decided to let the LM primary cannister stay on until this level after which we would start using the LM secondary cannister. The improvised CM cannisters had been ground tested and would then be used to verify the configuration.
</p>

<p>
III-28
</p>

<p>
...
</p>

<p>
By 87 hours, the following emergency procedures were available, although most of them were held in the MCC until needed or until a suitable time was available for the read-up. (This usually depended on which crewman was awake).
</p>

<p>
<ol type="1" start="1">
<li>Water transfer from CSM to PLSS to ascent tank.</li>
<li>Main B power-up and integrity check.</li>
<li>Entry power-up.</li>
<li>CM entry battery charging.</li>
<li>CM LiOH cannister fix. </li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
...
</p>

<br>

<p>
The consumable picture remained in good shape and the LM current was down to about 11-12 amps.
</p>

<p>
All water sources for LM cooling were being researched and a CSM checklist (launch) was in work to assure that all components were off the main busses and to provide a starting point for the entry checklist. 
</p>

<p>
III-29
</p>

<p>
- note that at about 91+10, the idea of transferring water with PLSS to LM ascent stage tanks was abandoned, since the procedure would have to be taken place at the end of the flight where things would be busy, and there was not enough justification based on present consumption to try the PLSS water transfer "which was really not guaranteed to work anyway (maybe not enough dP to force the transfer). "
</p>

<p>
III-30
</p>

<p>
At 93
</p>

<p>
III-32
</p>

<p>
A typical hourly summary [of consumables] is listed below.

<p>

</p>

<p>
Two MCC's would cost about 5 hours of both H2O and battery power so that H2O remained the critical consumable with a predicted depletion at about 160+00 GET.
</p>

<p>
III-39
</p>

<p>
The consumable status at this time [about 136+45, just before MCC-7 maneuver and SM separation, which happened at 138+02+00] was excellent.

<p>
Several alternate procedures were in work to control [partial pressure of ] CO2. These are listed below in their order of priorities:
</p>

<p>
(a) The LM ECS and CM ECS be connected with the IVT suit hose for CO2 scrubbing within CM canister assembly. This procedure was thought to case a high flow restriction for the LM compressor. It was learned later that this technique would have worked if the LM canisters were removed.
</p>

<p>
(b) Venting the combined cabins and replenishing with oxygen (100 percent) to nominal pressures. This procedure would be used as a last ditch effort because oxygen margins were not sufficient for many ventings and subsequent purgings plus efficiencies are very low for this mode of controlling high CO2 levels.

RECOMMENDATION:
</p>

<p>
CO2 scrubbing could have been accomplished by operating the CM suit compressor with two canisters installed in the canister assembly in their normal configuration.
</p>

<p>
This technique would have elminated the makeshift LM setup plus creating some much needed heat in the CM cabin environment. However, the power requirement for this and the initial unknown condition of the CSM Main Bus B eliminated this setup.
