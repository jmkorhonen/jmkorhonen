</p>

<p>
Five minutes after the accident, controllers asked the crew to connect fuel cell 3 to dc main bus B in order to be sure that the configuration was known. When it was realized that fuel cells 1 and 3 were not functioning, the crew was directed to perform an emergency powerdown to lower the load on the remaining fuel cell. Observing the rapid decay in oxygen tank no. 1 pressure, controllers asked the crew to switch power to the oxygen tank no. 2 instrumentation. When this was done, and it was realized that oxygen tank no. 2 had failed, the extreme seriousness of the situation became clear.
</p>

<p>
During the succeeding period, efforts were made to save the remaining oxygen in the oxygen tank no. 1. Several attempts were made, but had no effect. The pressure continued to decrease. 
</p>

<p>
It was obvious by about 1-1/2 hours after the accident that the oxygen tank no. 1 leak could not be stopped and that shortly it would be necessary to use the LM as a "lifeboat" for the remainder of the mission.
</p>

<p>
By 58:40 g.e.t., the LM had been activated, the intertial guidance reference transferred from the CSM guidance system to the LM guidance system, and the CSM systems were turned off. 
</p>

<p>
RETURN TO EARTH
</p>

<p>
The remainder of the mission was characterized by two main activities - planning and conducting the necessary propulsion maneuvers to return the spacecraft to Earth, and managing the use of consumables in such a way that the LM, which is designed for a basic mission with two crewmen for a relatively short duration, could support three men and serve as the actual control vehicle for the time required.
</p>

<p>
4-47
</p>

<p>
...
</p>

<p>
A number of propulsion options were developed and considered. It was necessary to return the spacecraft to a free-return trajectory and to make any required midcourse corrections. Normally, the service propulsion system (SPS) in the SM would be used for such maneuvers. However, because of the high electrical power requirements for using that engine, and in view of its uncertain condition and the uncertain nature of the structure of the SM after the accident, it was decided to use the LM descent engine if possible. 
</p>

<p>
The minimum practical return time was 133 hours g.e.t. to the Atlantic Ocean, and the maximum was 152 hours g.e.t. to the Indian Ocean. Recovery forces were deployed in the Pacific. The return path selected was for splashdown in the Pacific Ocean at 142:40 g.e.t This required a minimum of two burns of the LM descent engine. A third burn was subsequently made to correct the normal maneuver execution variations in the first two burns. One small velocity adjustment was also made with reaction control system thrusters. All burns were satisfactory. ...
</p>

<p>
The most critical consumables were water, used to cool the CSM and LM systems during use; CSM and LM battery power, the CSM batteries being for use during reentry and the LM batteries being needed for the rest of the mission; LM oxygen for breathing; and lithium hydroxide (LiOH) filter cannisters used to remove carbon dioxide from the spacecraft cabin atmosphere. These consumables, and in particular the water and LiOH cannisters, appeared to be extremely marginal in quantity shortly after the accident, but once the LM was powered down to conserve electric power and to generate less heat and thus use less water, the situation improved greatly. Engineers at MSC developed a method which allowed the crew to use materials on board to fashion a device allowing use of the CM LiOH cannisters in the LM cabin atmosphere cleaning system (see fig. 4-16). At splashdown, many hours of each consumable remained available (see figs. 4-17 through 4-19 and table 4-III).

LM Consumables Management

</p>

<p>
...
</p>

<p>
<ol type="a" start="2">
<li>An emergency powerdown checklist was available in the Flight Data File on board the LM. Minor revisions were made to the list to reduce electrical energy requirements to about 20 percent of normal operational values with corresponding reduction in usage of coolant loop water.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
<ol type="a" start="3">
<li>Mission Control determined that this maximum powerdown could be delayed until after 80 hours ground elapsed time, allowing the LM primary guidance and navigation system to be kept powered up for the second abort maneuver.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
<ol type="a" start="4">
<li>Mission Control developed contingency plans for further reduction of LM power for use in case an LM battery problem developed. Procedures for use of CM water in the LM also were developed for use if needed.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
<ol type="a" start="5">
<li>Toward the end of the mission, sufficient consumable margins existed to allow usage rates to be increased above earlier planned levels. This was done.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
<ol type="a" start="6">
<li>When the LM was jettisoned at 141:30 the approximate remaining margins were: </li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
Electrical power 4-1/2 hours<br>
Water 5-1/2 hours<br>
Oxygen 124 hours
</p>

<p>
Determinations
</p>

<p>
(1) Earlier contingency plans and available checklists were adequate to extend life support capability of the LM well beyond its normal intended capability.
</p>

<p>
(2) Mission Control maintained the flexibility of being able to further increase the LM consumables margins.

Modification of LM Carbon Dioxide Removal System
</p>

<p>
<ol type="1" start="46">
<li>Findings</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
<ol type="a" start="1">
<li>The lithium hydroxide (LiOH) cartridges, which remove water and carbon dioxide from the LM cabin atmosphere, would have become ineffective due to saturation at about 100 hours. </li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
<ol type="a" start="2">
<li>Mission rules set maximum allowable carbon dioxide partial pressure at 7.5 mm Hg. LiOH cartridges are normally changed before cabin atmosphere carbon dioxide partial pressure reaches this value.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
<ol type="a" start="3">
<li>Manned Spacecraft Center engineers devised and checked out a procedure for using the CM LiOH cannisters to achieve carbon dioxide removal. Instructions were given on how to build a modified cartridge container using materials in the spacecraft.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
<ol type="a" start="4">
<li>The crew made the modification at 93 hours, and carbon dioxide partial pressure in the LM dropped rapidly from 7.5 mm Hg to 0.1 mm Hg. </li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
<ol type="a" start="5">
<li>Mission Control gave the crew further instructions for attaching additional cartridges in series with the first modification. After this addition, the carbon dioxide partial pressure remained below 2 mm Hg for the remainder of the Earth-return trip.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
Determination
</p>

<p>
The Manned Spacecraft Center succeeded in improvising and checking out a modification to the filter system which maintained carbon dioxide concentration well within safe tolerances.
</p>

<p>
5-36
</p>

<p>
- another procedure that had to be worked out was how to use LM batteries to recharge CM reentry batteries. 
</p>

<p>
The procedure used the electrical umbilical between the LM and the CM which normally carried electrical energy from the CM to the LM. The procedure was nonstandard and was not included in checklists.
</p>

<p>
The procedure was initiated at 112 hours and CM batteries A and B were fully recharged by 128 hours.
</p>

<p>
Determination
</p>

<p>
Although there is always some risk involved in using new, untested procedures, analysis in advance of use indicated no hazards were involved. The procedure worked very well to provide an extra margin of safety for the reentry operation.
</p>

<p>
5-38
</p>

<p>
- also developed were reentry preparation procedures: normal procedure could not be used because SM reaction control system could not be used to separate the CM. Also, LM was to be attached for as long as possible to conserve the CM batteries.
