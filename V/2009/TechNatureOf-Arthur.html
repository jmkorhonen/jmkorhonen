Arthur, W. Brian (2009). <i>The Nature of Technology. What it is and how it evolves.</i> Free Press
</p>

<br>

<p>
17
</p>

<p>
For a full theory of evolution we would need something more [than gradual development]. We would need an argument that all technologies, not just some, are descended from earlier technologies, and an explicit mechanism by which this happens. Attempts to provide such an argument have been few, and unsuccessful. … …all [proposals] base their reasoning squarely on Darwin’s. The central idea… A given technology, … exists at a particular time in many variants. This is because it has different purposes to fulfill, different environments to operate to, and different designers who use different ideas. From these variations, some perform better and are selected for further use and development; they pass on their small differences to future designs. We can then follow Darwin and say that “it is the steady accumulation, through natural selection, of such differences, when beneficial to the individual, that gives rise to all the more important modifications of structure.” In this way technology evolves.
</p>

<p>
The argument sounds reasonable, but it quickly runs into difficulties. Some technologies … just appear, or at least they seem to just appear, and unlike novel biological species, they are not versions of earlier objects. The jet engine is not a variation of … anything else that preceded it …So explaining “novelty,” meaning abrupt radical novelty, becomes a major obstacle for technology evolutionists. The appearance of radically novel technologies … cannot be accounted for.
</p>

<p>
… a rather exttreme one, [way out], is to lean harder on Darwin and say that if different designers bring forth different variants of a technology, some of these variants and the ideas behind them may be radical. Change can therefore be radical and abrupt, as well as gradual. This sounds plausible enough, but if you look into what it<br>
18<br>
would require in practice for any radical innovation it does not stand up. … …you can vary 1930s radio circuits all you like and as radically as you like and you will never get radar, Even if you vary ideas about radio circuits all you like you will still not get radar. Radar requires a different principle than radio. … Certainly technologies exist in multiple versions and certainly superior performers are selected, so that later forms can indeed descend in this way from earlier ones. But when we face the key question of how radically novel technologies originate… Darwin’s mechanism does not work.
</p>

<p>
Combinatorial evolution
</p>

<p>
…<br>
What we should really be looking is not how Darwin’s mechanism should work to produce radical novelty in technology, but how “heredity” might work in technology. If evolution in its fullest sense holds in technology, then all technologies, including novel ones, must descend in some way from the technologies that preceded them.
</p>

<p>
19
</p>

<p>
…<br>
Novel technologies must somehow arise by combination of existing technologies.<br>
- idea mooted by various people for well over 100 years,<br>
- Schumpeter: “To produce, means to combine materials and forces within our reach… To produce other things, or the same things by a different method, means to combine these materials and forces differently. = new combinations of technology
</p>

<p>
20
</p>

<p>
- Usher (1929): Invention proceeds from “the constructive assimilation of pre-existing elements into new syntheses.”<br>
- Gilfillan (1935): an invention is a “new combination of prior art.”<br>
- however, nobody explained how such combination could bring forth a new invention<br>
- easy to say that a jet engine is a combination of parts available to Whittle and von Ohain, not easy to explain how such combination takes place in the minds of a Whittle or von Ohain.
</p>

<p>
Combination at least suggests a way by which novelty arises in technology. But this merely links individual novel technologies back to particular technologies that existed before. It does not yet give us a sense of the whole of technology building up from what went before. … If new technologies are indeed combinations of previous ones, then the stock of existing technologies must somehow provide the parts for combination. So the very cumulation of earlier technologies begets further cumulation.
</p>

<p>
21
</p>

<p>
- the idea’s history can be traced to Ogburn (1922); in his view, what generated “change in material culture” was the combination of previous technologies - invention - that builds cumulatively from earlier inventions. “It would seem that the larger the equipment of material culture the greater the number of inventions. The more there is to invent with, the greater will be the number of inventions.” This explained why more “primitive” societeies could not invent our modern technologies; they did not possess the necessary ingredients and knowledge of how to work with them.<br>
- Ogburn did not use the insight to construct any theory of technology or of its evolution.
</p>

<p>
…a mechanism for the evolution of technology… …would work as follows. Early technologies form using existing primitive technologies as components. These new technologies in time become possible components - building blocks - for the construction of further new technologies. Some of these in turn go on to become possible building blocks for the creation of yet newer technologies. In this way, slowly over time, many technologies form from an initial few, and more complex ones form using simpler ones as components. The overall collection of technologies bootstraps itself upward from the few to the many and from the simple to the complex. We can say that technology creates itself out of itself.
</p>

<p>
22
</p>

<p>
I will call this mechanism … combinatorial evolution.<br>
… Combination cannot be the only mechanism behind technology’s evolution. … Something else … than mere combination, must be going on to create novel technologies.
</p>

<p>
That something else … is the constant capture of new natural phenomena and the harnessing of these for particular purposes. … At the very start of technological time, we directly picked up and used phenomena: the heat of fire, the sharpness of flaked obsidian, the momentum of stone in motion. All that we have achieved since comes from harnessing these and other phenomena, and combining the pieces that result.
</p>

<p>
23
</p>

<p>
The Themes of the Book
</p>

<p>
This book is an argument about what technology is and how it evolves. It is an attempt to construct a theory of technology, “a coherent group of general propositions,” we can use to explain technology’s behavior. In particular it is an attempt to create a theory of evolution for technology.<br>
… I will build the argument piece by piece from three fundamental principles. The first… that technologies, all technologies, are combinations. This simply means that individual technologies are constructed or put together - combined - from components or assemblies or subsystems at hand. The second will be that each component of technology is itself in miniature a technology. … …the third fundamental principle will be that all technologies harness and exploit some oeffect or phenomenon, usually several.
</p>

<p>
24<br>
… If technologies are combinations they immediately have an interior: they are assembled from parts and groups of parts to meet their purpose. And this interior consists of parts and subsystems that themselves are technologies.<br>
- novel technologies originate by piecing together existing ones and by capturing phenomena<br>
- technologies develop by changing these interior parts, by swapping in better ones that improve their performance<br>
- different technologies possess internal parts inherited in common from previous technologies<br>
— technology acquires a GENETICS; a rich interlinked ancestry
</p>

<p>
- complexes of working processes that interact with other complexes to form new ones
</p>

<p>
…<br>
The change in vision I am proposing, from seeing technologies as stand-alone objects each with a fixed purpose to seeing them as objects that can be formed into endless new combinations, is not just abstract. It is mirrored in a broad shift in the character of technology currently taking place. The old industrial-process technologies of the sort that charcterized the manufacturing economy - the open-hearth process for steelmaking, the cracking process for refining crude oil - were indeed for the most part fixed. They did one thing only and did it in a fixed place: they processed particular raw material inputs into particular industrial outputs and did this largely in separate, stand-alone factories.
</p>

<p>
25
</p>

<p>
But now these relatively independent processing technologies are giving way to technologies of a different type. These can be easily combined and they form building blocks that can be used again and again.<br>
- e.g. GPS, algorithms, switches, routers, repeaters, web services, genetic engineering, nanotechnology…<br>
Modern technology is not just a collection of more or less independent means of production. Rather it is becoming an open language for the creation of structures and functions in the economy. Slowly, at a pace measured in decades, we are shifting from technologies that produced fixed physical outputs to technologies whose main character is that they can be combined and configured endlessly for fresh purposes.<br>
Technology, once a means of production, is becoming a chemistry.
</p>

<p>
27
</p>

<p>
Combination and structure
</p>

<p>
- is technology really a knowledge and applied science and a study of something and a practice and a collection - at the same time?
</p>

<p>
28
</p>

<p>
- defining technology from scratch: 3 definitions
</p>

<p>
<ol type="1" start="1">
<li>Technology is a means to fulfill a human purpose: either explicit, or hazy, multiple , and changing. As a means, a technology may be a method or process or device; simple or complex; material or nonmaterial.</li>
<li>Technology as an assemblage of practices and components. This covers technologies such as electronics or biotechnology that are collections or toolboxes of individual technologies and practices. (Strictly speaking, “bodies of technology”)</li>
<li>Technology as the entire collection of devices and engineering practices available to a culture. “technium” in Kevin Kelly’s words.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
29
</p>

<p>
The reason we need three meanings is that each points to technology in a different sense, a different category, from ethe others. Each cateogry comes into being differently and evolves differently.<br>
- a technology-singular originates as a new concept and develops by modifying its internal parts<br>
- a technology-plural comes into being by building around certain phenomena and components and develops by changing its parts and practices<br>
- technology-general originates from the use of natural phenomena and builds up organizally with new elements forming by combination from old ones.
</p>

<p>
Technology-singular:
</p>

<p>
- does something, executes a purpose; each technology executes a function.
</p>

<p>
30
</p>

<p>
-technology supplies a functionality; e.g. GPS locates<br>
- a device always “processes” some thing. All devices process something. That is why economists refer to technologies as means of production.<br>
- can we view methods and processes as devices? — Yes! Processes and methods are sequences of operations.
</p>

<p>
31
</p>

<p>
Processes are devices if we include the equipment that executes them.
</p>

<p>
A more general way to see that devices and processes are not different categories. A technology embodies a sequence of operations: we can call this its “software.” And these operations require physical equipment to execute them; the “hardware.” If we emphasize the “software,” we see a process or method. If we emphasize “hardware,” we see a physical device. Technologies consist of both; the two categories are merey different ways of viewing a technology.
</p>

<p>
Instance or the idea?<br>
We can talk of a particular example of a process, or the process.
</p>

<p>
32
</p>

<p>
How technologies are structured
</p>

<p>
- do technologies share any common logic? Is there any common structure in the way they are organized?<br>
- technologies share a common anatomical structure:<br>
- they are put together or combined from component parts or assemblies. A technology therefore is a combination of components to some purposes (combination principle, first of three principles mentioned in Ch 2)<br>
33
</p>

<p>
- assemblies, subsystems, or subtechnologies, or stages (in process technologies) are groups of components that are largely self-contained and largely partitioned off from other assemblies.<br>
- some basic technologies have only one part.<br>
- technology is always organized around a central concept or principle, “The method of the thing”, or essential idea that allows it to work<br>
- to be brought into physical reality a principle needs to be expressed in the form of physical components<br>
- in practice, this means that a technology consists of a main assembly: an overall backbone of the device or method that executes its base principle<br>
- the backbone is supported by other assemblies to take care of its working, regulate its function, feed it with energy, and perform other subsidiary tasks
</p>

<p>
34
</p>

<p>
- main assembly + a set of subassemblies that support this
</p>

<p>
35
</p>

<p>
“…an arrangement of connected building blocks that consists of a central assembly that carries out a base principle, along with other assemblies or component systems that interact to support this.”
</p>

<p>
…
</p>

<p>
Together these various modules and their connections form a working architecture. To understand a technology means to understand its principle, and how this translates into a working architecture.
</p>

<p>
Why modularity?
</p>

<p>
- there is no law that says that the components of a technology must be clustered intoa assemblies at all<br>
36
</p>

<p>
- Simon’s watchmaker parable:<br>
- grouping parts into assemblies gives better protection against unexpected shocks, more ease of construction, and more ease of repair. Grouping parts allows for separate improvement of the component organs of a technology: these can be split out from the whole for specialized attention and modification. It allows for separate testing and separate analysis of working functions: their assemblies can be “slid out” to be probed or replaced separately without dismantling the rest of the technology. And it allows for swift reconfiguration of the technology to suit different purposes: different assemblies can be switched in and out when needed.
</p>

<p>
- also simplifies the process of design.<br>
- breaking down anything complicated into higher-level parts or chunks
</p>

<p>
37
</p>

<p>
It costs something - mental effort at the very least - to partition the components of a technology into separate functional units. So it pays to divide a technology into such modules only if they are used repeatedly - only if there is sufficient volume of use.<br>
- parallel with division of labor:<br>
- modularity is to a technological economy what the division of labor is to a manufacturing one<br>
- the partition of technologies increases with the extent of the market
</p>

<p>
The way a functional unit is organized changes too as it becomes more used. A module or assembly begins typically as a loose grouping of individual parts that jointly execute some particular function. Later in its life, the grouping solidifies into a specially constructed unit.<br>
- transforms from a loosely put combination of laboratory techniques to being encapsulated within specially constructed machines.<br>
This is a general rule: what starts as a series of parts loosely strung together, if used heavily enough, congeals into a self-contained unit-. The modules of technology over time become standardized units.
</p>

<p>
Recursiveness and Its Consequences
</p>

<p>
Structure has another aspect. From our combination principle, a technology consists of component parts: assemblies, systems, individual parts. We could therefore conceptually break a technology into its functional components (ignoring whether these are supporting or central) starting from the top down.
</p>

<p>
38
</p>

<p>
Doing this would give us the overall technology, its main assembles, subassemblies, sub-subassemblies, and so on, until we arrive at the elemental parts.<br>
- forms a treelike hierarchy
</p>

<p>
Each assembly or subassembly has a task to perform. … Each therefore is a means to a purpose. Each therefore, by my earlier definition, is a technology. This means that the assemblies, subassemblies, and individual parts are all executables - are all technologies. … Technologies, in other words, have a recursive structure. They consist of technologies within technologies all the way down to the elemental parts.
</p>

<p>
Recursiveness will be the second principle we will be working with. … It means simply that a<br>
39<br>
jet engine (or more generally, any technology) consists of component building blocks that are also technologies, and these consist of subparts that are also technologies, in a repeating (or recurring) pattern.<br>
- hierarchy of executables can be followed upward and downward
</p>

<p>
41
</p>

<p>
The standard view [the most technology thinkers have taken] sees a technology as something largely self-sufficient and fixed in structure, but subject to occasional innovations. But this is true of technologies only if we think of them in the abstract, isolated in the lab, so to speak. … in the real world … a technology rarely is fixed. It constantly changes its architecture, adapts and reconfigures ase purposes change and improvements occur.
</p>

<p>
42
</p>

<p>
We also tend to think of technology as existing at a certain scale in the economic world. … There is no characteristic scale for technology.<br>
This does not mean there is no sense of “higher” and “lower” in a technology.<br>
…We can also see that every technology stands ready, at least potentially, to become a component in further technologies at a higher level. …<br>
Recursiveness also carries a deeper implication. Very often in the world of technology, changes at one level must be accomodated by changes at a different level.<br>
- higher level systems that control and deploy lower-level systems must change the way they are organized, if the lower-level capabilities change
</p>

<p>
43
</p>

<p>
- each technology derives from a central principle and has a central assembly. Each of thses is itself a technology.<br>
- the structure is recursive<br>
- an important implication: combination must work not just by bringing together a purpose with a concept or principle that matches it. It must provide a main set of assemblies or modules toe xecute this central idea. It must support this with further assemblies, and these again with further assemblies to support these. And all these parts and assemblies must be orchestrated to perform together harmoniously. Combination mut necessarily be a highly disciplined process.
</p>

<ol type="1" start="3">
<li>PHENOMENA</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
48
</p>

<p>
- the use of effects put together to achieve a purpose
</p>

<p>
49
</p>

<p>
- technology is based on a concept or principle. Are a principle and a phenomenon the same thing? The answer is no.<br>
A technology is built upon some principle, “some method of the thing,” that constitutes the base of idea of its working; this principle in turn exploits some effect (or several) to do this. Principle and phenomenon are different. That certain objects - pendulums or quartz crystals - oscillate at a steady given frequency is a phenomenon. Using this phenomenon for time keeping constitutes a principle, and yields from this a clock. … Phenomena are simply natural effects, and as such they exist independently of humans and of technology. They have no “use" attached to them. A principle by contrast is the idea of use of a phenomenon for some purpose and it exists very much in the world of humans and of use.
</p>

<p>
… Phenomena rarely can be used in raw form. … So the right combination of supporting means to set them up for the purpose intended must be found.<br>
This is where the supporting technologies … come in. Many of them … are there to provide for the base principle, feed it with energy, manage and regulate it. But many are also there to support the phenomena used and to arrange that they properly perform their needed function.
</p>

<p>
50
</p>

<p>
… Getting the phenomena to work requires a plethora of assemblies and supporting technologies.<br>
This gives us a deeper reason for technologies to consist of modules than the “chunking” for convenience of design or assembly … . The subsystems used to render a phenomenon usable for a specific purpose are technologies, and they rely on their own phenomena. Therefore a practical technology consists of many phenomena working together. …<br>
Nearly always it is necessary to set up these phenomena and separate them by allocating them to separate modules.
</p>

<p>
The essence of technology
</p>

<p>
We now have a more direct description of technology than saying it is a means to a purpose. A technology is a phenomenon captured and put to use.<br>
- or a collection of phenomena captured and put to use<br>
- could also use words like harnessed, seized, secured, employed, used…
</p>

<p>
51
</p>

<p>
… In its essence, a technology consists of certain phenomena programmed for some purpose. … A technology is a programming of phenomena for our purposes.<br>
This programming need not be obvious. And it need not be visible either, if we look at the technology from the outside.
</p>

<p>
52
</p>

<p>
… a technology in operation … ceases to be a mere object at work. It becomes a metabolism. … …the technology becomes a complex of interactive processes - a complex of captured phenomena - supporting each other, using each other, “conversing” with each other, “calling” each other much as subroutines in computer programs call eacn other.
</p>

<p>
53<br>
…<br>
Phenomena … are the “genes” of technology. The parallel is not exact of course, but still, I find it helpful to think this way.
</p>

<p>
54
</p>

<p>
…<br>
[Technology] creates its structures  - individual technologies - by “programming” a fixed set of phenomena in many different ways. New phenomena - new technological “genes” - of course add to this fixed set as time progresses. And phenomena are not combined directly: first they are captured and expressed as technological elements which are then combined. There are probably fewer phenomena than biological genes in use, but still, the analogy applies. Biology programs genes into myriad structures, and technology programs phenomena to myriad uses.
</p>

<p>
Purposed Systems
</p>

<p>
… I defined a technology as a means to a purpose. But there are many means to purposes and some of them do not feel like technologies at all. Business organisations, legal systems, monetary systems, and contracts are all means to purposes and so my definition makes them technologies. Moreover, their subparts - such as subdivisions and departments of organizations, say, are also means to purposes, so they seem to share the properties of technology. But they lack in some sense the “technology-ness” of technologies. So, what do we do about them? …
</p>

<p>
55
</p>

<p>
If we can get comfortable with the idea that all means - monetary systems, contracts, symphonies, and legal codes, as well as physical methods and devices - are technologies, then the logic of technology would apply to a much wider class of things than the devices and methods I have been talking about, and that would greatly enlatrge the scope of our argument.<br>
…<br>
… The monetary system makes use of the “phenomenon” that we trust a medium has value as long as we believe that others trust it has value and we believe this trust will continue in the future. Notice the phenomenon here is a behavioral, not a physical one. This explains why money fulfills the requirements of a technology but does not feel like a technology. It is not based on a physical phenomenon. The same can be said for the other nontechnology-like technologies… If we examine them we find they too are based upor behavioral or organizational “effects,” not on physical ones.<br>
So we can say this: Conventional technologies, such as radar and electricity generation, feel like “technologies” because they are based upon physical phenomena. Nonconventional ones, such as contracts and legal systems, do not feel like technologies because they are based upon nonphysical “effects” - organizational or behavioral effects, or even logical or mathematical ones in the case of algorithms. The signature of standard technology - what makes us recognize something as a technology - is that it is based upon a physical effect.
</p>

<p>
56
</p>

<p>
- what to do about non-physical technologies?<br>
- we can certainly admit them as technologies for the argument of this book, and I will do so<br>
- but they are not seen as technologies in daily life; yet we can choose to see them in this way
</p>

<p>
We can make all this a good deal more comfortable by adopting a simple stratagem. We can recognize that all along in the book we have really been talking about a class of systems: a class I will call purposed systems. This is the class of all means to purposes, whether physically or non-physically based.<br>
…<br>
We can admit … all means or purposed systems to the argument even if they do not depend upon physical effects. With suitable changes, the logic I am laying out also applies to them.
</p>

<p>
Capturing phenomena
</p>

<p>
57
</p>

<p>
- how do we uncover phenomena and capture them for use in the first place?<br>
- phenomena as “hidden underground and mined,” clustered into related families, each forming a seam or vein of useable effects<br>
- effects nearer the surface are harnessed first, deeper seams require systematic investigation &amp; modern methods
</p>

<p>
58
</p>

<p>
As a family of phenomena is mined into, effects uncovered earlier begin to create methods and understandings that help uncover later effects. One effect leads to another, then to another, until eventually a whole vein of related phenomena has been mined into.
</p>

<p>
59
</p>

<p>
The main electrical phenomena were uncovered between 1750 and 1875… With the capturing and harnessing of these for use, a parade of methods and devices followed…<br>
This buildout happened slowly as earlier effects in the form of instruments and devices helped uncover later ones. In this way the uncovering of phenomena builds itself out of itself. Phenomena cumulate by bootstrapping their way forwards: effects are captured and devices using these effects are built and uncover further effects.
</p>

<p>
Technology and Science
</p>

<p>
60
</p>

<p>
Where does the formal knowledge of phenomena - science - fit in? How is science connected to the use of phenomena? For that matter how is science connected to technology itself?<br>
- science is necessary for unearthing of modern phenomena<br>
- does this mean that technology is applied science, as Truxal stated: “Technology is simply the application of scientific knowledge to achieve a specified human purpose”?<br>
- it’s more complicated than that; many technologies - e.g. powered flight - came into being with little science at all
</p>

<p>
61
</p>

<p>
Technologists use scientific ideas much as politicians use the ideas of defunct political philosophers. They exploit them day-to-day without much awareness of the details of their origin. This is not because of ignorance. It is because ideas that originate in science become digested over time into the bodies of technology themselves - into electronics or biotechnology. They mingle in these fields with experience and special applications to create their own indigenous theories and practice. So it is naïve to say that technology “applies” science. It is better to say it builds both from science and from its own experience. These two cumulate together, and as this happens science organically becomes part of technology. Science is deeply woven into technology.<br>
But equally deeply, technology is woven into science. Science achieves its insights by observation and reasoning, but what makes these possible is its usef of methods and devices.

<p>
[Science] uses technologies in the form of instruments and experiments to answer specific questions. But of course it builds itself upon more than these. It builds its understanding from its scientific explanations, from its reasonings and theories about how the world works.<br>
- explanations are constructions with a purpose: their purpose is to make clear the workings of some observed feature of the world, and their components are conceptual elements that combine according to accepted rules. All explanations are constructions from simpler parts.<br>
…<br>
From all this it follows that science not only uses technology, it builds itself from technology.<br>
- from instruments, methods, experiments, and conceptual constructions
</p>

<p>
64
</p>

<p>
Stripped to its core structure, science is a form of technology.<br>
- does not mean that science is the same as technology.<br>
Science is a thing of beauty in itself. Of surpassing beauty. And it is much more than its core structure of instruments, experiments, and explanations. It is a set of moral ideas: that nature is intrisically knowable, that it can be probed, that causes can be singled out, that understandings can be gained if phenomena and their implications are explored in highly controlled ways. It is a set of practices and a way of thinking that includes theorizing, imagining, and conjecturing. It is a set of knowings - of understandings accumulated from observation and thought in the past. It is a culture: of beliefs and practices, friendships and exchanged ideas, opinions and convictions, competition and mutual help.<br>
…<br>
Technology builds from harnessing phenomena largely uncovered by science. And equally science builds from technology - or, better to say, forms from its technologies - from the use of the instruments and methods and experiments it develops. Science and technology co-evolve in a symbiotic relationship. Each takes part in the continued creation of the other, and as it does, takes in, digests, and uses the other; and in so doing, becomes thoroughly intermingled with the other.<br>
65
</p>

<p>
The two cannot be separated, they rely completely on one another. Science is necessary to uncover and understand deeply buried phenomena, and technology is necessary to advance science.
</p>

<p>
… …I believe along with Mokyr that it is almost impossible to exaggerate the importance of knowledge. … But I would express Mokyr’s observation [that technologies issue forth as human knowledge is gained] differently. As phenomena are uncovered and explored, they begin to be surrounded by a penumbra of understandings about their workings. These understandings - this theory and knowledge - help greatly in developing technologies from them. In fact nowadays they are indispensable. …<br>
New instruments and methods form from these uncovered and understood phenomena. These technologies help build yet further knowledge and understanding and help uncover yet further phenomena. Knowledge and technology in this way cumulate together.
</p>

<p>
66
</p>

<p>
- technologies cannot exist without phenomena but phenomena exist without technologies<br>
- if our normal phenomena did not operate, we could only probe that part of the universe by literally inventing our way into it; example, lack of gravity in orbit forces us to rethink even the simplest things, such as drinking water

- groupings: e.g. electronics group the devices and methods that work with electrons and their effects; components that deal with light and its transmission group into photonics, and so forth<br>
… I will argue that each grouping [of technologies] forms a language withih which particular technologies  - particular devices and methods - are put together as expressions within that language.
</p>

<p>
70
</p>

<p>
Why do individual technologies cluster into groupings? Sharing a family of effects is one reason, but it is not the only one. Elements that share a common purpose group together. … Elements that share common physical-strength and scale characteristics cluster… And elements that repeatedly form subparts of useful combinations cluster. …<br>
Sometimes elements cluster because they share a common theory. … What delineates a cluster of technologies is always some form of commonality, some shared and natural ability of components to work together.<br>
I will call such clusters - such bodies of technology - domains. A domain will be any cluster of components drawn from in order to form devices or methods, along with its collection of practices and knowledge, its rules of combination, and its associated way of thinking.<br>
It will be crucial… to keep the distinction between individual technologies and domains clear if we want to be unambiguous later about how technologies come into being and evolve. Sometimes the difference looks blurry: radar (the individual system) and radar technology (the engineering practice) sound very much the same. But they are not.
</p>

<p>
71
</p>

<p>
A technology  (individual, that is) does a job; it achieves a purpose - often a very particular purpose. A domain (technology-plural) does no job; it merely exists as a toolbox of useful components to be drawn from, a set of practices to be used. A technology defines a product, or a process. A domain defines no product; it forms a constellation of technologies - a mutually supporting set - and when these are represented by the firms that produce them, it defines an industry. A technology is invented; it is put together by someone. A domain - think of radio engineering as a whole - is not invented; it emerges piece by piece from its individual parts. A technology - an individual computer, say - gives a certain potentcy to whoever possesses it. A domain - the digital technologies - gives potential to a whole economy that can in time become transmuted into future wealth and political power.<br>
And there is another difference. Where technology possesses a hierarchy of assemblies, subassemblies, and components; domains possesses subdomains, and within these still further sub-subdomains. …<br>
One way to state the difference is to say that an individual technology is to a body of technology as a computer program is to a programming language.

Design in engineering begins by choosing a domain, that is, by choosing a suitable group of components to construct a device from.<br>
- Often this choice - domaining - is automatic.

<p>
72
</p>

<p>
- often it requires thought, e.g. whether to use Linux or Windows<br>
- in arts, the choice of domain is largely a matter of style<br>
- within technology, choice of domain decides the convenience and effectiveness of an assembly, what it can accomplish, how easily it can link with other assemblies, and what it will cost.<br>
- over time the choice of domain for a given purpose changes

[the example of relaxed static stability in aircraft, ie. moving from mechanical and hydraulical control systems to digital technology that allowed inherently unstable aircraft flyable only with the aid of computers]<br>
We could say in this case that aircraft controls underwent an “innovation.” And indeed they did. But more accurately we should say that aircraft controls were domained differently - redomained. This distinction is important. Innovations in history may often be improvements in a given technolgoy - a better way to architect domes, a more efficient steam engine. But the significant ones are new domainings. They are the expressing of a given purpose in a different set of components, as when the provision of power changed from being expressed in waterwheel technology to being expressed in steam technology.<br>
The reason such redomainings are powerful is not just that they provide a wholly new and more efficient way to carry out a purpose. They allow new possibilities.
</p>

<p>
- one can immediately recognize old science fiction illustrations as belonging to certain era because of the component sets they draw from, e.g. wrought iron and brickwork in 1800s<br>
An era does not just create technology. Technology creates an era. And so the history of technology is not just the chronicle of individual discoveries and individual technologies: the printing press, the steam engine, the Bessemer process, radio, the computer. It is also the chronicle of epochs - whole periods - that are defined by how their purposes are put together.<br>
…<br>
Domains not just define the times, they also define the reach of the times. … The domains of Babbage’s day - machines, railways, early industrial chemistry - had a short reach; they allowed a narrow set of possibilities. The domains of our day present wider possibilities. In fact, half of the effectiveness of a domain lies in its reach - the possibilities it opens up; the other half<br>
76<br>
lies in using similar combinations again and again for different purposes. These act something like the pre-formed blocks of commonly used expressions kept at hand for ready use by old-fashioned typesetters (the French printers of the 1700s called them clichés), except that they are conceptual and not necessarily premade.
</p>

<p>
Design as Expression Within a Language
</p>

<p>
A new device or method is put together from the available components - the available vocabulary - of a domain. In this sense a domain forms a language; and a new technological artifact constructed from components of the domain is an utterance in the domain’s language. This makes technology as a whole a collection of several languages, because each new artifact may draw from several domains. And it means that the key activity in technology - engineering design - is a form of composition.<br>
There are<br>
- articulate and inarticulate utterances<br>
- appropriate and inappropriate choices<br>
- conciseness<br>
- degrees of complication<br>
- simplicity and complexity<br>
- many choices of an utterance for any willed purpose<br>
- rules that must be followed when putting together an utterance<br>
Such rules can be called a grammar!
</p>

<p>
77
</p>

<p>
A domain’s grammar determines how its elements fit together and the conditions under which they fit together. It determines what “works.”<br>
- grammars arise ultimately from nature<br>
- and from practical experience<br>
- sometimes it can be reduced to rules of thumb, often not
</p>

<p>
78
</p>

<p>
…<br>
Good design in fact is like good poetry. Not in any sense of sublimity, but in the sheer rightness of choice from the many possible for each part. Each part must fit tightly, must work accurately, must conform to the interaction of the rest. The beauty in good design is that of appropriateness, of least effort for what is achieved. It derives from a feeling that all that is in place is properly in place, that not a piece can be rearranged, that nothing is to excess. Beauty in technology does not require originality. In technology noth form and phrases are heavily borrowed from other utterances, so in this sense we could say that, ironically, design works by combining and manipulating clichés. Still, a beautiful design always contains some unexpected combination that shocks us with its appropriateness.
</p>

<p>
79
</p>

<p>
Mastery in a technology in fact is difficult to achieve because a technology grammar, unlike a linguistic one, changes rapidly. Technology grammars are primitive and dimly perceived at first; they deepen as the base knowledge that comprises them grows; and they evolve as new combinations that work well are discovered and as the daily use of working designs reveals difficulties. …<br>
One result of this heavy investment in a domain is that a designer rarely puts a technology together from considerations of all domains available. The artist adapts himself, Paul Klee said, to the contents of his paintbox. “The painter … does not fit the paints to the world. He fits himself to the paint.”

Worlds Entered
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
- any domain is a repository of elements standing ready for particular uses. A toolbox of elements, or functionalities, available for the use<br>
- Arthur prefers to think of it as a realm, a world within which certain things can be done.
</p>

Costs cumulate anywhere an activity leaves one world and enters another.<br>

</p>

<p>
84
</p>

<p>
…”Bridging technologies” are usually the most awkward aspect of a domain. They create delays and bottlenecks, and therefore run up costs. But they are necessary because they make the domain avialable, and control what can enter and leave its world. We can think of a domain as containing a small number of central operations that are streamlined and cheap… But surrounding these on the outer edges of the domain are the slower and more awkward technologies that allow activities to enter its world and leave it when finished… These in general are costly.

<p>
- how technologies come into being and how technology evolves?<br>
- Arthur argues that the inside view of technologies (technologies have inside anatomies) makes a difference in how we see technology, in two important ways:<br>
1) how technologies modify themselves over their lifetime. If we see technologies from the outside as stand-alone objects, then individual ones appear to be relatively fixed things that may differ from one version to another and in this way change in fits and starts.
</p>

<p>
88
</p>

<p>
But if we look inside, we see that a technology’s interior components are changing all the time, as better parts are substituted, materials improve, methods for construction change, the phenomena the technology is based on are better understood, and new elements become available as its parent domain develops.<br>
- so technology is dynamic and fluid.
</p>

<p>
2) how we see technology’s possibilities (in a collective sense). Looked at from the outside, each technology in the collective appears to fulfiill some set of purposes and not much more.<br>
- however, technology does not just offer a set of limited functions: it provides a vocabulary of elements that can be put together - programmed - in endlessly novel ways for endlessly novel purposes.
</p>

<p>
89
</p>

<p>
Two motifs:<br>
- technologies adapt by changing their internal parts<br>
- novel structures come about through fresh combinations<br>
The main theme:<br>
- technology evolves by combining existing technologies to yield further technologies and by using existing technologies to harness effects that become technologies. See Chapter 9 for fuller discussion.
</p>

<p>
90
</p>

<p>
Innovation: Schumpeter’s definition of how an invention is co-opted into commercial use is confusing to Arthur. In the book, the word is used in its popular sense of novelty in technology. But that novelty comes in several forms:<br>
- new solutions within given technologies<br>
- novel solutions themselves<br>
- new bodies of technology<br>
- new elements added to the collective of technology<br>
The idea of “innovation” is too diffuse, too nebulous, to be useful; should instead talk about these specific types of novelty or innovation
</p>

Standard Engineering
</p>

<p>
What exactly do engineers do in their day-to-day activities? In general, they design and construct artifacts. …
</p>

<p>
91
</p>

<p>
Arthur’s definition of standard engineering: the carrying out of a new project, the putting together of methods and devices under principles that are known and accepted. … it is the planning, testing, and assembly of a new instance of a known technology; not the “invention” of the cable-stayed bridge or the aircraft, but the design and construction of a new version of the cable-stayed bridge, or a new version of the aircraft. For convenience, Arthur calls this activity “design.”<br>
- there is a spectrum of difficulty from conventional projects with customary practices and standard components, to more experimental ones, to projects that are really difficult and carry special challenges.
</p>

<p>
What exactly is involved in standard engineering - in design projects? The basic task is to find a form, a set of architected assemblies, to fulfill a set of purposes.<br>
- concept development<br>
- detailed design<br>
- manufacture and construction
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
94
</p>

<p>
The historian Thomas Hughes emphasizes that whether a new project is successful - meaning that it results in a finished viable design -<br>
95<br>
depends to a high degree on the larger network of interests surrounding it: its engineering champions, funding bureaucracies, sponsors and other participants who stand to gain or lose power, security, or prestige from the finished work.
</p>

<p>
Engineering as Problem Solving
</p>

<p>
…<br>
Standard engineering, as I have defined it, deals with known technologies. This makes each design a new version - a new instance - of something already known. But a new instance, a new design project, is only called for if some aspect of the technology needs to be different (if that were not the case, the known standard design could be taken off the shelf and construction would follow). … This means that a new project always poses a new problem.
</p>

<p>
96
</p>

<p>
- the overall response, the finished project, is always a solution.
</p>

<p>
We can say that a finished design is a particular solution to a particular engineering problem.<br>
- however, in general, when a new version of an existing technology is constructed, each level, and each module at each level, must be rethought and if it does not fit with the rest or work as hoped, it must be redesigned.<br>
Each of these redesigns poses its own problem. So more accurately we can say a finished design is a set of solutions to a set of problems.
</p>

<p>
Combination and Solutions
</p>

<p>
If engineering is about problems, what exactly constitutes a “solution” or set of solutions to a problem?<br>
- if a solution is an appropriate combination that carries out a given task,
</p>

<p>
97
</p>

<p>
… How is a solution in engineering a construction and how exactly does this involve combination?<br>
- this is a central issue: how exactly does combination work in design?<br>
- engineers are not perhaps even conscious that they are combining things.
</p>

<p>
Combination is not the goal of the creation process in engineering. It is the result of these choices, the result of putting elements together for a new instance of a technology. Combination is a byproduct.
</p>

<p>
98
</p>

<p>
… as with language, intention comes first and the means to fulfill it - the appropriate combination of components - fall in behind it. Design is an expression.
</p>

<p>
- why engineering is not perceived to be as creative as other fields? There is mundane architecture as well…?<br>
- public not trained to appreciate a particularly well-executed piece of technology<br>
- compositions in technology are largely hidden; they tend to lie on the inside, hidden within some casing, or within lines of algorithm code… not at all visible to the uninitiated.
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
- Maillart’s concrete bridges in Switzerland as an example
</p>

<p>
100

<p>
- constraints often act to complicate the problem being solved and therefore to call for a larger number of parts to accomplish the job

<p>
- standard engineering learns through small modifications
</p>

<p>
Solutions Becoming Building Blocks
</p>

<p>
- standard engineering contributes to the evolution of technology<br>
- occasionally some solutions are used repeatedly enough to become objects in their own right, and they go on to become new elements used in the cosntruction of further technologies
</p>

<p>
102
</p>

<p>
If the resulting design is particularly useful, it gets taken up by others, begins to spread through the community, and finds general use. It becomes a new building block.<br>
The process works much as Richard Dawkins’s memes do.<br>
- a parallel in language, where new terms summarize some complicated group of thoughts and becomes a new part of the vocabulary, e.g. “Munich” or “Watergate.”
</p>

<p>
103<br>
- is this Darwinian? need to be careful - solutions do not come about in incremental step-by-step changes as biological changes are forced to do.<br>
They are combinations that can be put together instantly and they come out of purposeful problem solving.<br>
What we can say precisely is this. The process of problem solving in engineering brings forth novel solutions - novel combinations - in an abrupt way that does not match Darwin’s slow cumulation of changes. Then from these, the better ones are selected, and then propagate through engineering practice, á la Darwin. Some of these become elements for the construction of further technologies. The primary mechanism that generates building blocks is combination; Darwinian mechanisms kick in later, in the winnowing process by which only some of these solutions survive.<br>
- this does not mean that the best or fittest solutions always survive<br>
- winner takes it all/lock in/law of increasing returns: as a solution becomes more prevalent, it becomes more visible, and therefore more likely to be adopted and improved by other engineers.
</p>

<p>
104
</p>

<p>
- how light water reactor became the standard design: historian Mark Hertsgaard: experience with LWRs in U.S. Navy use “gave the light water model a head start and momentum that others were never able to match and led the industry to base its commercial future on a reactor design that some experts have subsequently suggested was economically and technically inferior.”
</p>

<p>
105
</p>

<p>
- standard engineering contributes greatly to technology’s innovation and evolution<br>
- many purposed systems are novel, but not necessarily invented; such systems emerge over time in a process similar to the way solutions emerge in standard engineering.
</p>

<p>
106
</p>

<p>
This type of nondeliberate coming-into-being is not unusual. … …novel purposed systems can arise nondeliberately as practices or conventions, solutions to some problem in the economy or society, and if useful they can go on to become components in wider systems.

<li>THE ORIGIN OF TECHNOLOGIES</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
- the equivalent question to how novel species arise in Darwin is, for technology, how radically novel technologies arise.<br>
- Darwin’s solution does not wotk for technology: technology does not arise from cumulative small changes or by simple combination<br>
- combination isn’t ruled out, but it must take place in some more ordered way than pure randomness<br>
- what we are asking is how does invention happen?<br>
…there is no satisfying answer to this in modern thinking about technology. The last major attempts to theorize about invention were in the 1930s, but the subject fell from fashion in the decades that followed, in no small part because the “creative act” deemed to be at its center was held to be imponderable. And so, today invention occupies a place in technology like that of “mind” or “consciousness” in psychology; people are willing to talk about it but not really to explain what it is.
</p>

<p>
108
</p>

<p>
We do know several things about how novel technologies arise. We know, mostly from research in sociology,<br>
- that novel technologies are shaped by social trends<br>
- they come often from experience gained outside the standard domain they apply to<br>
- they originate more often in conditions that support risk<br>
- they are often catalyzed by networks of colleagues
</p>

<p>
But [these findings] do not explain how a new technology comes into being any more than pointing to suitable soil explains how a seed comes to germinate. … From what process then - from what source - do the devices and methods and products that form the economy originate?
</p>

<p>
What qualifies as a Novel Technology?
</p>

<p>
- what makes a technology an invention?<br>
I will define radically new technology as one that uses a principle new or different to the purpose in hand.<br>
- a principle is the method of something’s operation, the base way in which something works
</p>

<p>
109
</p>

<p>
A change in principle then separates out invention - the process by which radically novel technologies arise - from standard engineering. It also allows us to draw crucial distinctions between mere improvement and real origination.<br>
- however, sometimes improvements are commercially more important than pure originations<br>
Depending on the degree of novelty of the base principle, a continuum exists between standard engineering and radical novelty.
</p>

<p>
Recall that a principle is a concept, the idae of some effect or phenomenon in use. So a technology built upon a new principle is actually one built upon a novel or different use of some effect - or effects. This gives us a strong hint about where novel technologies come from. They arise from linking, conceptually and in physical form, the needs of some purpose with an exploitable effect (or set of effects). Invention, we can say, consists in linking a need with some effect to satisfactorily achieve that need.
</p>

<p>
110
</p>

<p>
(Of course to qualify as more than standard engineering, the principle or use of this effect must be new to the purpose.)
</p>

<p>
- picture this linkage as a chain:<br>
- at one end, the need or purpose to be fulfilled<br>
- at the other, the base effect that will be harnessed to meet it<br>
- linking the two, the overall solution, the new principle, or concept of the effect used to accomplish that purpose<br>
- the links in the chain represent the systems and assemblies that make the solution possible<br>
- each of these links has its own task to perform and may therefore face its own challenges, requiring sub- and sub-sub-links.<br>
We can think of invention as the process that puts this chain together.
</p>

<p>
But whatever its variations, invention falls into two broad patterns. It may start from one end of the chain, from a given purpose or need, and find a principle to accomplish this. Or, it may start from the other end, from a phenomenon or effect, usually a newly discovered one, and envisage in it some principle of use. In either pattern the process is not complete until the principle is translated into working parts.
</p>

<p>
111
</p>

<p>
Finding a Base Principle
</p>

<p>
… The need may arise from an economic opportunity, the recognition of a potentially lucrative market perhaps; or from a change in economic circumstances; or from a social challenge; or from a military one.<br>
Often the need arises not from an outside stimulus, but from within technology itself. …<br>
Typically such a need sits for some time with at least some practitioners aware of it, but with none seeing an evident solution. If there were one, standard technology would suffice. The question is therefore by definition challenging. Those that do take up the challenge may encounter the situation as a need to be fulfilled or a limitation to be overcome, but they quickly reduce it to a set of requirements - a technical problem to be solved.
</p>

<p>
112
</p>

<p>
… The need becomes a well-specified problem.<br>
The problem now comes forward as it were, looking to meet an appropriate solution. The mind (for the moment I will treat the originator as a singular mind, but more usually several minds are at work) becomes fixed on the problem. It scans possibilities that might with further development satisfy the desiderata. This search is conceptual, wide, and often obsessive. … This continuous thinking allows the subconscious to work, possibly to recall an effect or concept from past experience, and it provides a subconscious alertness so that when a candidate principle or a different way to define the problem suggests itself the whisper at the door is heard.<br>
What is being sought at this stage is not a full design. What is being sought, as I said earlier, is a base concept: the idea of some effect (or combination of effects) in action that will fulfill the requirements of the problem, along with some conception of the means to achieve this.<br>
- back and forth process between levels continues as new candidate principles are considered, and the new obstacles narrow and redefine what needs to be solved<br>
- resembles hill climbing routine!
</p>

<p>
113
</p>

<p>
…certain stretches of the mountain may have been climbed before - in our context certain subtechnologies may be available and the solution will be biased toward using these. So the process may be more like stiching together known parts than pioneering a complete route from scratch.
</p>

<p>
Where do these candidate routes - these principles  - come from?<br>
- sometimes a principle is appropriated (borrowed) from some other purpose or domain that uses it; e.g. Whittle considered rockets, rotating nozzles, turboprops, ducted fan blowers for jet engine<br>
- sometimes a new overall principle is suggested by combining previous concepts; cavity magnetron was combined from a magnetron and a klystron tube<br>
- sometimes a principle is recalled from the past, picked up from the remark of a colleague, or suggested by theory
</p>

<p>
114<br>
- sometimes the principle - the conceptual solution - is stitched together from existing functionalities, each one solving a subproblem (cyclotron’s problem of achieving extremely high voltages was overcome by Wideröe’s subprinciple of using low alternating voltage across a series of tubes, and Lawrence’s subprinciple of using a magnetic field to greatly reduce the space needed.)
</p>

<p>
115
</p>

<p>
In all these cases principles are appropriated from or suggested by that which already exists, be it other devices or methods or theory or functionalities. They are never invented from nothing. At the creative heart of invention lies appropriation, some sort of mental borrowing that comes in the form of a half-conscious suggestion.
</p>

<p>
116
</p>

<p>
- the insight comes suddenly in a moment of connection, to single person who “knows” it is correct, usually in moments of stillness<br>
- however, this is not the end of the process but a marker along the way; the concept must still be translated into a working prototype of a technology before the process is finished.
</p>

<p>
Embodying the Concept in Physical Form
</p>

<p>
- this phase will normally have been already partially under way, so this second phase overlaps the first<br>
Bringing the concept to full reality means that a detailed architecture must be worked out; key assemblies must be built, balanced, and cosntructed; measuring instruments must be appropriated; theoretical calculations must be made
</p>

<p>
117
</p>

<p>
- all this needs encouragement and finance to back it up<br>
- competition helps at this stage, may be intense if rival groups have glimpsed the principle and are developing it
</p>

<p>
This second phase of invention consists mostly in finding working solutions to challenging subproblems, and it has a great deal of the character of standard engineering.
</p>

<p>
118
</p>

<p>
- each subproblem can often be solved in several ways
</p>

<p>
119
</p>

<p>
- the second phase is over with a) the initial demonstration of the principle and b) developing it to a robust working version, a semireliable state of being. This completes the process of invention.
</p>

<p>
Invention Proceeding from a Phenomenon
</p>

<p>
Typically someone notices an effect, or posits it theoretically, and this suggests an idea of use - a principle. As with the starting-from-a-need motif, supporting pieces and parts must then be worked out to translate the princile into a working technology.<br>
- phenomenon may sometimes directly suggest a principle of use, but just as often the principle is not obvious. (e.g. the effect of penisillin on bacterial growth had been remarked by John Tyndall in 1876 and André Gratia in the 1920s; Fleming had been a doctor in the WW1 and appalled by losses due to battlefield infections)
</p>

<p>
120
</p>

<p>
- Wright Brothers did not so much demonstrate an “invention” but solved four key subproblems that hindered the known principles of propulsion via light-weight internal combustion and lift from fixed-wing airfoils<br>
- cases like these are not at all rare, and do not constitute a different pattern; rather they are variations of the two other patterns<br>
- here the base principle has either emerged naturally or is somehow obcious<br>
- the difficulty is to get the principle to work properly, which can take years of effort
</p>

<p>
121
</p>

<p>
What Lies at the Heart of Invention?
</p>

<p>
… At its heart lies the act of seeing a suitable solution in action - seeing a suitable principle that will do the job. The rest, allowing some high degree of exaggeration, is standard engineering. Sometimes this principle emerges naturally, as something obvious or easily borrowed. But in most cases it arrives by conscious deliberation; it arises through a process of association - mental association.<br>
How exactly does this mental association take place?<br>
- often not thinking of the solution - instead thinking in terms of how to use achievable actions and deliverable effects (functionalities) in combination to arrive at a solution<br>
- reaching into a store of functionalities and imagining what will happen when certain ones are combined<br>
- in principle, this does not differ from the mundane ones we handle in daily life, where we solve everyday problems with everyday functionalities
</p>

<p>
122
</p>

<p>
- invention just takes place in a territory that is unfamiliar to us, but familiar to the inventor<br>
Invention at its core is mental association.<br>
- it uses functionalities<br>
- the originator reaches into a store of these and imagines what will happen when certain ones are combined<br>
- sometimes associations form directly from principles themselves<br>
- principles often apply across fields<br>
- originators thinking of a needed functionality (e.g. how can I measure motion) associate from some given field and borrow principles from it<br>
- the core of mechanism - principle transfer - is seeing an analogy<br>
- imagination is also necessary; originators must have the imagination to see the problem as important in the first place, to see that it might be solvable, to envisage several solutions, to see the necessary components and architectures for each, and to solve the inevitable sub-problems that come up.
</p>

<p>
123
</p>

<p>
What is common to originators is not “genius” or special powers. In fact, I do not believe there is any such thing as genius. Rather it is the possession of a very large quiver of functionalities and principles. Originators are steeped in the practice and theory of the principles or phenomena they will use.
</p>

<p>
124
</p>

<p>
The Pyramid of Causality
</p>

<p>
I have described invention in this chapter as a micro-process by which an individual (or several) comes up with a novel way of doing things. But it is one that occurs in a context. A novel technology emerges always from a cumulation of previous components and functionalities already in place.<br>
- seeing novel technology as the culmination of a progression of previous devices, inventions, and understandings that led up to the technology in question<br>
- supporting any novel device or method is a pyramid of causality that leads to it;<br>
<div style='padding-left: 30pt'>
- other technologies that used the principle in question<br>
- of antedecent technologies that contributed to the solution<br>
- of supporting principes and components that made the new technology possible<br>
- of phenomena once novel that made these in turn possible<br>
- of instruments and techniques and manufacturing processes used in the new technology<br>
- of previous craft and understanding<br>
- of the grammars of the phenomena used and of the principles enmployed<br>
- of the interactions among people at all these levels described
</div>
</p>

<p>
Particularly important in this pyramid of causality is knowledge - both of the scientific and technical type - that has cumulated over time. This knowledge, as historians Joel Mokyr and Edwin Layton have pointed out, is contained within engineering practice itself, but also within technical universities, learned societies, national academies of science and of engineering published journals. All these form the all-important substrate from which technologies emerge.
</p>

<p>
125
</p>

<p>
The pyramid of causality supports the micro-process of invention much as a logistics system supports an army in battle. …<br>
Saying that new technologies have a causal history does not imply their appeearance is predetermined. Invention is subject to the vagaries and timing of the discovery of new phenomena, of the appearance of new needs, and of the insights arrived at by individuals who respond to these. Still, the fact that all inventions are supported by a pyramid of causality means that an invention tends to show up when the pieces necessary for it, and the need for it, fall into place.<br>
This rough “readiness” in timing makes it rare for a novel technology to be the work of a single originator. Typically several groups of inventors have envisaged the principle in action at more or less the same time and have made attempts at a working version of it. Such multiple efforts and filling in of key pieces in fact make it difficult to speak of “invention” in the sense of being first. In most cases we can find some vague prior articulation or prior embodiment of the principle, perhaps not well grasped, but prior just the same. And almost as often we find a series of prototypic versions by different workers who borrow from each other, with the device or method improving gradually in effectiveness from crude beginnings as improved subtechnologies are found.
</p>

<p>
126
</p>

<p>
… The facts that the principle occurs to many, and that there exist different working versions of the principle in action, normally thwart efforts to assign credit for “being first” to a single person or group. If credit for “invention” must be assigned, it should go to the person or team that first had a clear vision of the principle, saw its potential, fought for its acceptance, and brought it fully into satisfactory use. And usually there are several of these.<br>
- human interaction and informal networks greatly enhance the process; giving the originator access to information that has built up around the problem and around previous efforts; offer suggestions of principles at work in other domains; provide equipment and know-how to bring concepts to physical reality
</p>

<p>
Invention in Science and Mathematics?
</p>

<p>
- does the logical structure extend to origination in science and in mathematics?<br>
- yes, with a few necessary changes:
</p>

<p>
127
</p>

<p>
The reason is that teories whether in science or in mathematics are purposed systems, just as technologies are. They are constructions from component systems that fulfill given purposes, and so the same logic as in technology applies to them.<br>
- Darwin borrowed a “subprinciple” from Malthus
</p>

<p>
128
</p>

<p>
Origination in scientific theorizing, as in technology, is at bottom a linking - a linking of the observational givens of a problem with a principle (a conceptual insight) that roughly suggests these, and eventually with a complete set of principles that reproduces these.<br>
[origination in mathematics] This is also a linking, but this time of what needs to be demonstrated - usually a theorem - to certain conceptual forms or principles that will together construct the demonstration. Think of a theorem as a carefully constructed logical argument. It is valid if it can be constructed under accepted logical rules from other valid components of mathematics - other theorems, definitions, and lemmas that form the available parts and assemblies in mathematics.
</p>

<p>
129
</p>

<p>
That origination in science or in mathematics is not fundamentally different from that in technology should not be surprising. The correspondences exist not because science and mathematics are the same as technology. They exist because all three are purposed systems - means to purposes, broadly interpreted - and therefore must fllow the same logic. All three are constructed from forms or principles: in the case of technology, conceptual methods; in the case of science, explanatory structures; in the case of mathematics, truth structures consistent with basic axioms. Technology, scientific explanation, and mathematics therefore come into being via similar types of heuristic process - fundamentally a lnking between a problem and the forms that will satisfy it.
</p>

<p>
Invention and Novel Building Blocks
</p>

<p>
…[novel technologies] arise from a process… of linking a need with a principle (some generic use of an effect) that will satisfy it. This linkage stretches from the need itself to the base phenomenon that will be harnessed to meet it, through supporting solutions and subsolutions. And making it defines a recursive process. The process repeats until each subproblem resolves itself into one that can
</p>

<p>
130
</p>

<p>
be physically dealt with. In the end the problem must be solved with pieces - components - that already exist (or pieces that can be created from ones that already exist). To invent something is to find it in what previously exists.
</p>

<p>
Why invention varies so much? A particular case<br>
- can be a need-driven or phenomenon-driven<br>
- can have a lone originator or many<br>
- its principle may be difficult to conceive of, or it may have emerged naturally<br>
- translating the principle into physical components may be straightforward or may proceed in steps as crucial subproblems are resolved
</p>

<p>
But whatever their particular histories, at bottom all inventions share the same mechanism: all link a purpose with a principle that will fulfill it, and all must translate that principle into working parts.
</p>

<p>
- novel building blocks arise in three possible ways:<br>
<div style='padding-left: 30pt'>
- as solutions to standard engineering problems (the Armstrong oscillator)<br>
- as nondeliberate inventions (the monetary system)<br>
- as inventions; radically novel solutions that use new principles (the jet engine)
</div>
</p>

<p>
131
</p>

<p>
CHAPTER 7. STRUCTURAL DEEPENING
</p>

<p>
- technology is typically initially crude, then is developed through improvements and advances<br>
There is no neat separation between the origination of a technology and its development.<br>
- once development gets underway, different working versions of the technology emerge
</p>

<p>
132
</p>

<p>
- different versions and branch applications of a technology offer different solutions to technical problems<br>
The technology, we can say, shows variation in its solutions. It also shows (or is subject to) selection; over time developers borrow freely from the many available solutions and select some for their designs. This is where Darwinian variation and selection really come in, in technology. The many versions of a technology improve in small steps by the selection of better solutions to their internal design problems.<br>
But designers also improve technologies by deliberate efforts of their own, and invoking Darwin does not tell us how they do this. Nor does it explain a puzzle in the development process. Technologies tend to become more complex - often much more complex - as they mature. … …to say this has happened by variation and selection… challenges the imagination. Something more than pure variation and selection must be going on.
</p>

<p>
Internal Replacement
</p>

<p>
- as technology becomes a commercial or military proposition, its performance is “pushed” to deliver even more.<br>
- better components, improved architecture, fine-tuning, balancing of parts…<br>
- but a base principle can only be pushed so far before the system runs into a barrier
</p>

<p>
133
</p>

<p>
- each barrier forms a bottleneck<br>
- if the impeded component is itself a subtechnology, it can often be replaced by e.g.<br>
<div style='padding-left: 30pt'>
- a better design<br>
- rethought solution<br>
- a solution intellectually appropriated from another group<br>
- a different material
</div>
</p>

<p>
In fact, often developers are seeking not so much a better part, but a sharper version of the phenomenon that the part provides. … Indeed it is safe to say that most of materials science is about seeking improvements in phenomena by understanding the properties of materials that produce these.<br>
The improved component … will require adjustments in other parts to accomodate it; it will require a rebalancing of the technology. It may even require a rethinking of the technology’s architecture.
</p>

<p>
134
</p>

<p>
- this process of improvement by internal replacement applies recursively to all constituent parts of the technology<br>
This means we need to think of a technology as an object - more an organism, really - that develops through its constituent parts and subparts improving simultaneously at all levels in its hierarchy.<br>
- also, a technology piggybacks on the external development of its components; great deal of development happens automatically as components improve in other uses “outside” that technology.
</p>

<p>
Structural Deepening
</p>

<p>
- internal replacement explains part of increasing complexity; the parts become on average more complex<br>
- another mechanism is structural deepening:<br>
Developers can indeed work around an obstacle by finding better components and better materials. But they can also work around it by adding an assembly, or further system of parts, that takes care of it. Here the component presenting an obstacle is not replaced by a different one. It is retained. But additional components and assemblies are added to it to work around its limitation.
</p>

<p>
135
</p>

<p>
By adding subsystems to work around such limitations, technologies elaborate as they evolve. They add “depth” or design sophistication to their structures.<br>
They become more complex.<br>
The forces driving this sort of complication are not just limitations that happen within the technology’s overall performance. A technology needs not just to perform well. It<br>
- needs to be able to operate properly as external conditions change<br>
- needs to be capable of performing a range of tasks<br>
- needs to be safe and reliable
</p>

<p>
Limitations can arise with any of these. So we can say that to overcome limits, a technology will add subsystems or assemblies that<br>
a) enhance its basic performance,<br>
b) allow it to monitor and react to changed or exceptional circumstances<br>
c) adapt it to a wider range of tasks, and<br>
d) enhance its safety and reliability<br>
- again, this process is recursive and applies to subsystems as well.
</p>

<p>
136
</p>

<p>
137
</p>

<p>
Whittle’s turbojet prototype of 1936 had one moving compressor-turbine combination and a few hundred parts; its modern equivalent has upwards of 22 000 parts.
</p>

<p>
The process of improvement by structural deepening is slow. … The reason is that not only must the new assemblies and work-arounds be conceived of, they must be tested and proved, and the new system containing them must be rebalanced and optimized. That takes time.<br>
The economics of the process also govern timing. Improvements speed up if competition from other developers becomes heated, and slow down if competition is absent. Developers may be aware of obvious lines of technical advance, but it may not pay to undertake them. Whether competitive pressures are present or not, the set of improvements at any time will still be carefully chosen. Fresh improvements that are technically achievable may be put off until it pays to come out with an overall redesign.<br>
… The process moves in fits and starts, and it relies heavily on structural deepening.
</p>

<p>
138
</p>

<p>
- the costs of additional subsystems and subparts may not be a problem in physical objects, where the cost after development may simply be that of materials or space used or weight added.<br>
- however, for “nontechnological” systems the burden can be considerable:<br>
Systems such as military organizations, legal arrangements, university administrations, and word-processing software may also purchase improved performance by adding subsystems and subparts. … But the cost of these “improvements” - in the form of complication and bureaucracy - does not amortize. It is ongoing, and such overhead may be difficult to get rid of when circumstances no longer require it.
</p>

<p>
Lock-in and Adaptive Stretch
</p>

<p>
…eventually there comes a time when neither component replacement nor structural deepening add much to performance. The technology reaches maturity. If further advancement is sought, a novel principle is needed. But novel principles cannot be counted on to arrive when needed. Even when they do, they may not easily replace the old one. The old design, the old principle, tends to be locked in.<br>
Why?<br>
- elaborations, cumbersome as they are, allow the mature technology to perform better than its nascent rivals<br>
- changing surrounding structures and organizations may be expensive (economic reasons)<br>
- Marvin Frankel (1955) wondered why cotton mills in Lancashire did not adopt the more modern efficient machinery of their American counterparts. The reason was they were heavier, and installing them to the Victorian brick structures that housed the old machinery wouldn’t have been possible.<br>
- psychological reasons: practicioners not comfortable with the new vision, threatened by new<br>
<div style='padding-left: 30pt'>
- sociologist Diane Vaughan talks of psychological dissonance:
</div>
“a frame of reference constructed from integrated sets of assumptions, expectations, and experiences. Everything is perceived on the basis of this framework. The framework becomes self-confirming, because, whenever we can, we tend to impose it on experiences and events, creating incidents and relationships that
</p>

<p>
140
</p>

<p>
conform to it. And we tend to ignore, misperceive, or deny events that do not fit in. As a consequence, it generally leads us to what we are looking for. This frame of reference is not easily altered or dismantled, because the way we tend to see the world is intimately linked to how we see and define ourselves in relation to the world. Thus, we have a vested interest in maintaining consistency because our own identity is at risk.”<br>
- the greater the distance between a novel solution and the accepted one, the larger is this lock-in to previous tradition.<br>
- so hysteresis - a delayed response to change - exists.<br>
This lock-in of an older successful principle causes a phenomenon I will call adaptive stretch. When a new circumstance comes along or a demand for a different sphere of application arrives, it is easier to reach for the old technology - the old base principle - and adapt it by “stretching” it to cover the new circumstances.<br>
In practice this means taking the standard components of the old technology and reconfiguring them for the new purpose, or adding further assemblies to them to achieve the new purpose.
</p>

<p>
141
</p>

<p>
… At some point of development, the old principle becomes ever more difficult to stretch. The way is now open for a novel principle to get a footing. The old principle of course lingers, but it becomes specialized for certain purposes. And the new principle begins to elaborate.<br>
The phenomena I am describing in this chapter and the previous one - origination of a new principle, structural deepening, lock-in, and adaptive stretch - therefore have a natural cycle. A new principle arrives, begins development, runs into limitations, and its structure elaborates. The surrounding structure and professional familarity lock in the principle and its base technology. New purposes and changed circumstances arise and they are accomodated by stretching the locked-in technology. Further elaboration takes place. Eventually the old principle, now highly elaborated, is strained beyond its limits and gives way to a new one. The new base principle is simpler, but in due course it becomes elaborated itself.<br>
Thus the cycle repeats, with bursts of simplicity at times cutting through growing elaboration.
</p>

<p>
…the overall cycle I am describing resembles the cycle Thomas Kuhn proposed for the development of scientific theories.
</p>

<p>
142

<p>
- Kuhn can be restated in terms talked in this chapter

<p>
CHAPTER 8: REVOLUTIONS AND REDOMAININGS
</p>

<p>
- the last two chapters answered how individual technologies come into being and develop<br>
- this chapter explores how bodies of technology (“domains”) come into being and develop<br>
- domains are not invented; they emerge, crystallizing around a set of phenomena or a novel enabling technology<br>
- development timescale is in decades<br>
- developed by a wide number of interested parties<br>
- affect the economy more deeply than do individual technologies
</p>

<p>
146
</p>

<p>
- Arthur argues that the economy does not adopt a new body of technology; rather, it encounters it<br>
- if the resulting change in activities, industries, and organizational arrangements is important enough, we call that a revolution
</p>

<p>
How Domains Evolve
</p>

<p>
How exactly do domains come into being and susequently develop?<br>
- many coalesce around a central technology, e.g. computer<br>
- others form around families of phenomena and the understandings and practices that go with these (electronics built from understandings of the workings of electrons)<br>
- domains are always born from some established field<br>
- this must be, because the original parts and understandings must be constructed from somewhere<br>
- a new field is hardly a field at all, more like a cluster of understandings and methods thrown loosely together
</p>

<p>
147
</p>

<p>
- often the new domain’s components are enlisted as auxiliaries for an older domain<br>
- at this early stage, the nascent field is still very much part of its parent domain<br>
- new domain begins to emerge from compoent functions<br>
- early, there is an experimental feeling about the field<br>
- in time, the new cluster acquires its own vocabulary and its own way of thinking<br>
- its understandings deepen and its practices solidify<br>
- its components improve as each goes through its own version of the development process<br>
- finally, a consciousness emerges that a new field is starting to exist in its own right as a toolbox of technologies and practices begins to form
</p>

<p>
148
</p>

<p>
- if a breakthrough is important it may become an enabling technology: a means to a purpose that primises significant commercial application or offers a key element for the construction of further elements<br>
- enabling technologies mark the adolescence, perhaps even early adulthood<br>
- technical pioneers begin to crowd in and form little companies<br>
- a host of improvements follows<br>
- an industry starts to grow, and the new field becomes exciting
</p>

<p>
149
</p>

<p>
- investment may pour in<br>
- many companies enter at this stage with not much more than ideas to offer<br>
<div style='padding-left: 30pt'>
- the economist Carlota Perez has investigated the stages technology revolutions go through, and points out that such conditions can bring on an investment mania - and a crash.<br>
- nascent domains bring crashes usually when there is a sense of scramble for space in the market
</div>
- even if there has been a crash, the new domain survives<br>
- eventually it works its way deeply into the economy and falls into a stable period of growth<br>
- the early competitive frenzy is over; survivors grow into large corporations<br>
- the mood of the new period is one of sobriety and hard work, of confidence and steady growth<br>
- the new technology has found its place and becomes an underlying part of the economy
</p>

<p>
150
</p>

<p>
- this period can last for decades, and is one of steady buildout of the technology<br>
- as further time passes, the domain reaches a comfortable old age<br>
- new patents are for less significant ideas<br>
- some domains at this stage are superseded by newer ones and perish, but most live on
</p>

<p>
- not all domains go through this cycle as neatly as described: some reinvent themselves every few years; they morph.
</p>

<p>
A domain morphs when one of its key technologies undergoes radical change; electronics changed in character when the transistor replaced the vacuum tube. More usually a domain morphs when its main areas of applicaiton change.<br>
- computation was originally an aid to scientific calculation, in the 1960s about commerce and accounting, by 1980s about office applications, by 1990s in internet services and commerce, now on network intelligence
</p>

<p>
151
</p>

<p>
Each such morphing grows on top of the previous ones, and each forces the domain’s adherents to change their ideas about what the field is all about. But even with such radical changes, the base principles of a field remain the same…
</p>

<p>
- a domain can also throw off new subdomains, that often have a multiple parentage<br>
- e.g. the internet and information technology children of computation and telecommunications<br>
- the parent fields live on, but they have birthed things that exist on their own<br>
This tendency to morph and to sire new subdomains gives bodies of technology a living quality. They are not fixed collections but miniature ecologies - parts and practices that must fit together at any time, that change constantly as new elements enter, and throw off little subcolonies from time to time that have a different character.<br>
All this means that domains - and by implication any body of technology - are never neatly defined. They add and lose elements; borrow and exchange parts from other domains; and throw off new subdomains. Even when they are relatively well-defined and fixed, their parts and practices vary from one time to another, from one locale to another, and indeed from one country to another.
</p>

<p>
The Economy Redomaining
</p>

<p>
What happens to the economy as all this takes place…?
</p>

<p>
152
</p>

<p>
- consequences spread out<br>
…the arrival of a new technology causes the web of prices and production in the economy to stretch and reshape itself across all industries.<br>
A similar process applies to bodies of technology.<br>
- e.g. railroad<br>
… So we can say that bodies of technology cause a pattern of spreading readjustments in the economy, just as individual technologies do.<br>
This way of looking at things is perfectly valid, but it is not quite complete. With bodies of technology, something more complicated than readjustment happens.
</p>

<p>
153<br>
- standard argument:<br>
Economics posits that novel technologies are “adopted”; they are taken up and used in the economy.<br>
- certainly true for individual technologies<br>
- Arthur prefers to say that the elements of the economy (industries, firms, business practices) encounter, rather than adopt, a new body of technology (technology-plural)<br>
- from this encounter, new processes, new technologies, and new industries are born as a result<br>
How does this happen?<br>
- the new body of technology can be thought of as its methods, devices, understandings, and practices<br>
- a particular industry can be thought to comprise of its organizations, business processes, production methods and physical equipment<br>
- all these are technologies in a wide sense<br>
- these two collections of individual technologies come together and encounter each other<br>
- as a result, new combinations form
</p>

<p>
Viewed up close, adoption is always a merging of processes from the adopting field with functionalities from a new domain of possibilities.<br>
- if new combinations formed this way are powerful enough, they can found a new industry, or at least a subindustry
</p>

<p>
154
</p>

<p>
- e.g. serious derivatives trading was made possible by computation
</p>

<p>
155
</p>

<p>
… Viewed generally then, the process of redomaining means that industries adapt themselves to a new body of technology, but they do not do this merely by adopting it. They draw from the new body, select what they want, and combine some of their parts with some of the new domain’s, sometimes creating subindustries as a result. As this happens the domain of course adapts too. It adds new functionalities that better fit it to the industries that use it.<br>
- by no means an uniform process; different ways and different rates of response in different industries etc.<br>
- works outwards: from changes in the small-scale activities of the economy, to changes in the way business is organized, to changes in institutions, to changes in society itself<br>
The domain and the economy mutually co-adapt and mutually create the new.<br>
It is this process of mutual change and mutual creation that we call a revolution. Each era in the economy is a pattern, a more or less self-consistent set of structures in business and industry and society set in place by the dominant domains of the day. When new bodies of technology …. spread through the economy, old structures fall apart and new ones take their place. Industries that once were taken for granted become obsolete, and new ones come into being.
</p>

<p>
156
</p>

<p>
… It would be a mistake to say that revolutions happen only when the grand domains change the economy. They also happen as domains of smaller degrees of importance … come in and cause change at smaller scales. And so, at any time, many revolutions overlap, interact, and simultaneously alter the economy. As these new bodies of technology work into the economy, together they form a mutually consistent set of structures, a roughly consistent pattern in the economy. Each pattern may arise abruptly, lock in for a time, and in time become the infrastructure for the next.
</p>

<p>
Time in the Economy
</p>

<p>
All this unfolding of the new technology and readjusting of the economy takes time.<br>
- this explains a puzzle in economics:<br>
- usually several decades lie between the coming of enabling technologies and the domain’s full impact<br>
- in the adoption story, these delays must be caused by the time people take to find out about the new way of doing things and decide it would improve their circumstances<br>
- such time lags might account for 5-10 years; NOT 30-40 years!
</p>

<p>
157
</p>

<p>
The puzzle dissolves once we admit that what happens is not just a simple process of adoption, but the larger process of mutual adaptation between the domain and the economy I have been talking about. It is not enough that the base technologies of a revolution become available. A revolution does not fully arrive until we organize our activities - our businesses and commercial procedures - around its technologies, and until these technologies adapt themselves to us. For this to happen, the new domain must gather adherents and prestige. It must find purposes and uses. Its central technologies must resolve certain obstacles and fill certain gaps in its set of components. It must develop technologies that support it and bridge it to the technologies that use it. It must understand its base phenomena and develop the theory behind these. Markets must be found, and the existing structures of the economy must be re-architected to make use of the new domain. And the old dispensation must recognize the new domain and become familiar with its inherent practices, which means that practicing engineers who command the grammar of the old need to retool themselves for the new. They do not do this ligtly. All this must be mediated by finandce, by institutions, by management, by goverment policies, and by the availability of people skilled in the new domain.<br>
Thus this process is paced not by the time it taeks people to notice the different way of doing things and adopt it, but rather by the time it takes existing structures of the economy to re-architect themselves to adapt to the new domain. This time is likely to be decades, not years. And during this time the old technology lives on. It persists despite its demonstrated inferiority.<br>
- Economic historian Paul David gave a classic example of the process in 1990: adoption of electric engines in factories took over 40 years
</p>

<p>
158
</p>

<p>
- the effective use of the new technology required a different physcal construction of the factory, literally a new factory<br>
- how this factory should be constructed was not obvious: the electricians who understood the new domain were not architects, and the architects were not electricians.<br>
- accumulating knowledge of how to accomodate factory design to the new technology, and spreading the new knowledge, took 40 years!
</p>

<p>
It is not sufficient that businesses and people adapt to a new body of technology. The real gains arrive when the new technology adapts itself to them.<br>
In a sense, these processes of structural change do not just take time in the economy, they define time in the economy. … Conventionally time is measured as standard clock time. But there is another way to measure time, and this is by the “becoming” of new structures. Philosophers call this relational time. It means that if things stayed always the same, there would be no change by which to mark the passing of things - no change to mark “time.” In this sense, time would stand still. By the sam principle, if structures changed, if things in the universe were to move and alter themselves, “time” would emerge.<br>
In our case, change - time in the economy - emerges by the underlying structure of the economy altering itself. This happens on two scales, one fast and one slow. The faster scale, call it fast-time, is where the design and testing and absorption into the economy of new individual technologies creates the pace at which things “become,” the pace at which new business activities and new ways<br>
159<br>
of doing things form. In conventional time this would be measured in months and years. The slower scale - slow-time - emerges where change is determined by the entry of new bodies of technology. These create eras in the economy and society; they thereby create “time” in the economy. In conventional time this scale would be measured in years and decades.<br>
In both these senses, time does not create the economy. The economy, or changes in its structure, creates time.

<p>
Innovation and National Competitiveness
</p>

<p>
- leading edge of buildout of new bodies of technology is noticeably concentrated in one country or region, or at most a few. Why?<br>
- if technology issued forth from knowledge - technical and scientific information - then any country that possessed capable engineers and scientists would in principle be as innovative as any other.<br>
- advanced technology depends on more than knowledge - facts, truths, ideas, and information<br>
- real advanced knowledge issues not from knowledge but from something I will call deep craft. It’s more than knowledge: it’s a set of knowings<br>
<div style='padding-left: 30pt'>
- what is likely or unlikely to work<br>
- what methods to use<br>
- what principles are likely to succeed
</div>
160<br>
<div style='padding-left: 30pt'>
- what parameter values to use in a given technique<br>
- who to talk with to get things working<br>
- how to fix things that go wrong<br>
- what to ignore<br>
- what theories to look for
</div>
This sort of craft-knowing tales science for granted and mere knowledge for granted. And it derives collectively from a shared culture of beliefs, an unspoken culture of common experience.<br>
- science too at this level is also craft<br>
- such knowings root themselves in local micro-cultures: firms, buildins, corridors<br>
- not a particularly new observation: Alfred Marshall in 1890 (quote follows)
</p>

<p>
161
</p>

<p>
- the mysteries of the trade, or shared knowings, are now deeper, if anything<br>
- they take time to build up, and do not transfer easily to other places<br>
- they cannot be fully written down<br>
- it follows that once a region - or a country - gets ahead in an advanced body of technology, it tends to get further ahead. Success brings success.<br>
- other locations can contribute; they can manufacture and improve the technology, but they will not be initiationg it on a large scale because the detailed knowings needed to push the edge are not resident there<br>
- decline can be prevented by parlaying expertise from one body of technology into experience in another<br>
162<br>
- silicon valley started in wireless telegraphy around 1910, parlayed that into electronics in 30s and 40s, seeded a great deal of the computer indsutry, and has now turned to biotechnology and nanotechnology
</p>

<p>
- countries that are not leaders in technology are not in a hopeless position<br>
- well thought out incentives for startups and investment in basic undirected science can do much<br>
- technology always spins off from some seed activity<br>
- technology proceeds out of deep understandings of phenomena, and these become embedded as a deep set of shared knowings that resides in people and establishes itself locally, and grows over time<br>
- not easily controllable from top down
</p>

<p>
163
</p>

<p>
Planting, watering, and weeding are more approprite than five-year plans.
</p>

<p>
- new domains are more like new languages
</p>

<p>
164
</p>

<p>
Innovation is not something mysterious. Certainly it is not a matter of vaguely invoking something called “creativity.” Innovation is simply the accomplishing of the tasks of the economy by other means.<br>
In the cases I have studied, again and again I am struck that innovation emerges when people are faced by problems - particular, well-specified problems. It arises as solutions to these are conceived of by people steeped in many means - many functionalities - they can combine. It is enhanced by funding that enables this, by training and experience in myraid functionalities, by the existence of special projects and labs devoted to the study of particular problems, and by local cultures that foster deep craft. …<br>
In fact, we can see that innovation has two main themes. Ine is this constant finding or putting together of new solutions out of existing toolboxes of pieces and practices. The other is industries constantly combining their practices and processes with functionalities drawn from newly arriving toolvoxes - new domains.<br>
- new domains more important than new technologies, because a new domain of significance is encountered by all industries in an economy.<br>
- should we speak of “development” or “evolutione”? “Evolution” is how the whole of technology creates new elements from those that already exist
</p>

<p>

<p>
CHAPTER 9. THE MECHANISMS OF EVOLUTION
</p>

<p>
- Arthur claims that the collective of technology evolves by a process of self-creation:<br>
<div style='padding-left: 30pt'>
- new elements are constructed from ones that already exist, and these offer themselves as possible building-block elements for the construction of still further elements
</div>
</p>

<p>
168
</p>

<p>
- how technologies are created from existing technologies?<br>
<ol type="1" start="1">
<li>Any solution to a human need can only be made manifest in the physical world using methods and components that already exist in that world</li>
<li>Novel technologies are therefore brought into being - made possible - from some set of existing ones.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
169
</p>

<p>
All technologies are birthed from existing technologies in the sense that these in combination directly made them possible.<br>
- the degree of fuzziness as to what should count as parents to a technology does not disturb the central point: all technologies are birthed - made possible - from previous technologies.<br>
- saying that technology creates itself does not mean that technology has any consciousness, or that it uses humans<br>
170<br>
- the collective of technology is self-producing<br>
- or autopoietic, to follow Humberto Maturana and Francisco Varela (autopoietic = Greek for self-creating or self-bringing-forth)<br>
autopoiesis tells us that<br>
- every novel technology is created from existing ones, and therefore stands upon a pyramid of others<br>
- all future technologies will derive from those that now exist, although not necessarily in any obvious way<br>
- history is important; if the order of technologies had been different, the technologies built upon them would have been different<br>
- value of technology lies not merely in what can be done, but also in what further possibilities it will lead to
</p>

<p>
171
</p>

<p>
- a discussion of history in a Genesis-style view, from the self-creating point of view
</p>

<p>
172
</p>

<p>
- larger forces that drive technology evolution are<br>
- combination, the ability of the existing collective to “supply” new technologies<br>
- demand, for means to fulfill purposes, or the need for novel technologies
</p>

<p>
Combination
</p>

<p>
- William Ogburn observed in 1922: “The more there is to invent with, the greater will be the number of inventions.” He pointed out that the growth of technologies shows exponential growth.
</p>

<p>
173
</p>

<p>
- combinations simplified<br>
- in general, for N possible base elements in a combination (each combination only once, not counting the singles or null combination)<br>
(2^N) - N - 1
</p>

<p>
174
</p>

<p>
- if new technologies lead to further new technologies, then once the numbers of elements in the collective pass some rough treshold, the possibilities of combination begin to explode
</p>

<p>
Opportunity Niches
</p>

<p>
- potentially “supplied” combinations will only come to existence if there exists some “demand” for them<br>
- demand is not a very good word; better to talk about opportunities or niches<br>
- human needs create niches
</p>

<p>
175
</p>

<p>
- needs are not fixed, but depend greatly on a state of society, and begin to differentiate into subneeds once the society reaches some degree of prosperity<br>
<ol type="1" start="1">
<li>human needs are not just created by technology furnishing prosperity, they are created directly by individual technologies themselves. E.g. once we have the means to diagnose diabetes, we generate a human need for a means to control diabetes.</li>
<li>the vast majority of niches for technology are created from the needs of technologies themselves:</li>
</ol>
- every technology sets up an opportnity for fulfilling its purpose more cheaply or efficiently, so there exists an open opportunity for every technology<br>
- every technology requires supporting technologies to manufacture it, organize its production and distribution, maintain it, and enhance its performance<br>
- these in turn require their own support
</p>

<p>
176
</p>

<p>
<ol type="1" start="3">
<li>third reason technology generates needs is because technology often creates problems</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
for the argument, a complete theory of how human and technical needs form is not needed; we need the awareness that<br>
- the system consists not just of technologies creating technologies, but also of technologies creating opportunity niches for other technologies<br>
- opportunity niches are not fixed and given, but to a very large degree generated by technologies themselves<br>
- they change as the collective of technology changes, and elaborate and grow as the collective grows
</p>

<p>
The Core Mechanism
</p>

<p>
- the whole bootstraps its way upward
</p>

<p>
177
</p>

<p>
By what exact steps - what exact mechanism - does this bootstrapping work?<br>
- active collection represented by lit nodes; these are the elements (technologies) that are economically viable and currently used in the economy. Unlit ones are “dead” and may get revived.<br>
- from time to time new technologies are added to the active set, but not uniformly<br>
- this results the active network growing rapidly in some places and not at all in others<br>
- the collection of opportunity niches changes too<br>
- each novel element must satisfy at least one need or purpose<br>
- mediating all this is the economy, by determining costs and prices and therefore signaling opportunities to be fulfilled by novel elements, and deciding which candidate technologies will enter the active collection (for more on the role of economy, see Chapter 10)<br>
178
</p>

<p>
how does the active network of technologies build out?<br>
- it evolves over time by a series of encounters between new technological possibilities and current opportunity niches<br>
- each encounter is both an engineering and an economic one<br>
- a candidate solution must technically “work” and its cost must be in line with what the market is willing to pay<br>
- technologies that fulfill these conditions are potential “solutions” for the purpose at hand<br>
- this process is algorithmic: it operates by discrete steps:
</p>

<p>
We can start by supposing that a candidate novel technology appears. It has been made possible by a combination of previous technologies and has bested its rivals for entry into the economy. Six events or steps then follow. …
</p>

<p>
<ol type="1" start="1">
<li>The novel technology enters the active collection as a novel element. It becomes a new node in the active collection.</li>
<li>The novel element becomes available to replace existing technologies and components in existing technologies.</li>
<li>The novel element sets up further “needs” or opportunity niches for supporting technologies and organizational arrangements</li>
</ol>
179<br>
<ol type="1" start="4">
<li>If old displaced technologies fade from the collective, their ancillary needs are dropped. The opportunity niches they provide disappear with them, and the elements that in turn fill these may become inactive.</li>
<li>The novel element becomes available as a potential component in further technologies - further elements.</li>
<li>The economy - the pattern of goods and services produced and consumed - readjusts to these steps. Costs and prices (and therefore incentives for novel technologies) change accordingly.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
- in practice, the steps do not follow each other in a tidy way. Often they operate in parallel.<br>
- any of these events takes time to play out
</p>

<p>
180
</p>

<p>
- the destruction of ancillary technologies is not exactly the Schumpeter’s “gales of creative destruction”, but more like domino effects or avalanches of destruction<br>
- there are also avalanches or winds of opportunity creation
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
- evolution of complex components, history dependence, avalanches of destruction, punctuated equilibrium &amp; “cambrian explosions”
</p>

<p>
A Different Form of Evolution?
</p>

<p>
186
</p>

<p>
- there is nothing predetermined about the exact sequence of evolution<br>
- it is historically contingent<br>
- but not completely random<br>
- pipeline for next decade or so is reasonably predictable<br>
- indeterminacy increases as the collective develops<br>
- change is not uniform in time
</p>

<p>
187
</p>

<p>
- Arthur means literal evolution when he speaks of evolution in the collective of technology.<br>
- the differences are in combinatiorial evolution (however, there is horizontal gene transfer in some bacteria and gene regulatory networks occasionally add parts by combination)<br>
- larger structures in biology are created as combinations of simpler ones, and functional features can form from individual parts lying at hand<br>
188<br>
- however, combinatorial evolution is much rarer in biology; whereas they are the norm in technology<br>
189<br>
- is technology alive? It is self-organizing and autopoietic. It reproduces, grows, responds and adapts to its environment, and takes in and gives out energy to maintain its being. Technology is living in a sense a coral reef is living.

<p>
CHAPTER 10. THE ECONOMY EVOLVING AS ITS TECHNOLOGIES EVOLVE
</p>

<p>
- the alternative way of looking (to previous chapters) at evolution is through the eyes of the economy<br>
An economy mirrors the changes in its technologies, the additions and replacements I have been talking about. And it does this not merely by smoothly readjusting its patterns of production and consumption or by creating fresh combinations, as we saw in Chapter 8. It alters its structure - alters the way it is arranged - as its technologies evolve, and does this at all times and at all levels.
</p>

<p>
The Economy as an Expression of Its Technologies
</p>

<p>
The standard way to define the economy - whether in dictionaries or economics textbooks - is as a “system of production and distribution and consumption” of goods and services.
</p>

<p>
192
</p>

<p>
- we perceive this system as something that exists in itself as a backdrop to the events and adjustments that occur within it<br>
- “economy as a gigantic container for its technologies”<br>
- this is not quite wrong, but not quite right either
</p>

<p>
- to explore structural change, Arthur defines the economy as the set of arrangements and activities by which a society satisfies its needs.<br>
- this definition, these arrangements, are close to “means of production”; the definition wouldn’t have surprised Marx who saw the economy as issuing from its “instruments of production”<br>
- Arthur defines the arrangements to include all the myriad devices and methods and all the purposed systems we call technologies (see Chapter 3)
</p>

<p>
193
</p>

<p>
If we include all these “arrangements” in the collective of technology, we begin to see the economy not as a container for its technologies, but as somethign constructed from its technologies. The economy is a set of activities and behaviors and flows of goods and services mediated by - draped over - its technologies. It follows that the methods, processes, and organizational forms I have been talking about form the economy.<br>
The economy is an expression of its technologies.<br>
- does not mean that economy is identical to its technologies<br>
- just that the structure of the economy is formed by its technologies; they are its skeletal structure<br>
- it’s like seeing an ecology not as containing a collection of biological species, but as forming from its collection of species
</p>

<p>
194
</p>

<p>
- some consequences:<br>
- the economy emerges from its technologies: so the economy does more than readjust as its technologies change; it continually forms and re-forms as its technologies change<br>
- the character of the economy - its form and structure - change as its technologies change
</p>

<p>
… As the collective of technology builds, it creates a structure within which decisions and activities and flows of goods and services take place. It creates something we call “the economy.” The economy in this way emerges from its technologies. It constantly creates itself out of its technologies and decides which new technologies will enter it.<br>
- notice the circular causality<br>
- technology creates the structure of the economy, and the economy mediates the creation of novel technology<br>
- normally this technology-creating-the-economy-creating-technology cycle is not visible as it is visible only when observed over decades
</p>

<p>
Structural change
</p>

<p>
- in addition to the same adjustments and fresh combinations as in Chapter 8, the system would see someting more:<br>
- the addition of new technologies setting in motion a train of changes to the structure of the economy, to the set of arrangements around which the economy forms.<br>
- this is the territory of economic historians
</p>

<p>
195
</p>

<p>
- this gives abstract tools for thinking about structural change, not just ad hoc and case-by-case basis as economic historians have so far used<br>
- we can capture the sequence of changes with the evolution of technology model:
</p>

<p>
Suppose now once again that a new technology enters the economy. It replaces old technologies that carried out the same purpose… (steps 1,2,3 and 6 are similar)<br>
But also, as in steps 5 and 3;<br>
- the new technology provides potential new elements that can be used internally in other technologies. It thereby acts to call forth other technologies that use and accomodate it. In particular it may give rise to novel organizations that contain it.<br>
- The new technology may set up opportunity niches for further technologies. Such opportunities arise in various ways, but in particular they may arise from the new technology causing novel technical, economic, or social problems. And so, the new technology sets up needs for further technologies to resolve these.<br>
- this is restatint the same steps in economic terms, but with different emphasis
</p>

<p>
196
</p>

<p>
The whole moves forward in a sequence of problem and solution - of challenge and response - and it is this sequence we call structural change. In this way the economy forms and re-forms itself in spates of change, as novelty, new arrangements to accomodate this, and the opening of opportunity niches follow from each other.
</p>

<p>
197
</p>

<p>
- example from textile industry in Britain
</p>

<p>
- is this too simplistic, too mechanical a view of structural change?<br>
- there is, at least, nothing simple about structural change even if these sequences do form the basis for it<br>
- recursion at least ensures that<br>
198<br>
- some responses are not economic at all; the very idea that hand craft could be mechanized spread from textiles to other industries, leading to new machinery; and psychologically, factories created not just a new organizational set of arrangements but called for a new kind of person.<br>
Factory discipline, says historian David Landes, “required and eventually created a new breed of worker… No longer could the spinner turn her wheel and the weaver throw his shuttle at home, free of supervision, both in their own good time. Now the work had to be done in a factory, at a pace set by tireless, inanimate equipment, as part of a large team that had to begin, pause, and stop in unison - all under the close eye of overseers, enforcing assiduity by moral, pecuniary, occasionally even physical means of compulsion. The factory was a new kind of prison; the clock a new kind of jailer.” The new technology caused more than economic change, it caused psychological change.<br>
- not all changes may be tangible, and they may not be “arrangements”<br>
- changes may have multiple causes and high multiplicilty of effects<br>
- but still, structural change can be thought of in logical terms, theoretically if you like, using the evolutionary model<br>
Structural change in the economy is not just the addition of a novel technology and replacement of the old, and the economic adjustments that follow these. It is a chain of consequences where the arrangements that form the skeletal structure of the economy continually call forth new arrangements.<br>
- nothing is predetermined<br>
199<br>
… Technology determines the structure of the economy and thereby much of the world that emerges from this, but which technologies fall into place is not determined in advance
</p>

<p>
Problems as the Answers to Solutions
</p>

<p>
- since the consequences of even one novel technology can persist without a letup, the economy is never quite at stasis<br>
- Schumpeterian logic<br>
- but Arthur’s argument implies more than Schumpeter said:<br>
- the coming of novel technologies does not just disrupt the status quo, it also sets up a train of technological accomodations and of new problems, and in so doing it creates new opportunity niches that call forth fresh combinations which in turn introduce yet further technologies - and further problems.<br>
200
</p>

<p>
- economy is always unsatisfied<br>
- the result is not just Schumpeter’s disturbance of equilibrium, but a constant roiling of simultaneous changes, all overlapping and interactint and triggering further change. The result is change begetting change.<br>
- we are not very conscious about this, because the process of structural change plays out over decades, not months<br>
- this process could come to halt only in principle: if no novel phenomena in the future were to be uncovered, or if the possibilities for further combinations were somehow exhausted, or if our practical human needs were somehow fulfilled by the available technologies we possessed.<br>
- each of these is unlikely<br>
- another reason: as a general rule, every technology contains the seeds of a problem(s)<br>
201<br>
- if we are lucky, we experience a net benefit that we call progress<br>
202<br>
Is there anything constant about structural change?<br>
- the economy always forms its patterns from the same elements:<br>
<div style='padding-left: 30pt'>
- the predilections of human behavior<br>
- the basic realities of accounting<br>
- the goods bought must equal goods sold
</div>
the means by which these laws are expressed change over time, and the patterns they form change and re-form over time
</p>

<p>
- that economics cannot be pinned down to an unchanging set of descriptions over time is not a failing, it’s proper and natural (says the economist…)<br>
The economy is not a simple system; it is an evolving, complex one, and the structures it forms change constantly over time. This means our interpretations of the economy must change constantly over time.
