</p>

<p>
- traditional evolutionary models of technical change ask questions about the technology life cycle, namely<br>
- where does technical variation originate?<br>
- under what conditions does a dominant design emerge, or not?<br>
- what determines which design will become "dominant"?<br>
- what drives the rate and direction of technological change during periods of incremental progress?<br>
- when does a technological discontinuity occur?
</p>

<p>
- these are examined in economics, e.g. Dosi 1984, Nelson and Winter, 1982, Sahal, 1981; and in organizations, e.g. Tushman and Anderson, 1986; Tushman and Rosenkopf, 1992; Utterback, 1974.<br>
- more recent papers on technology life cycle Murmann and Frenken, 2006; Suarez, 2004; these have ignored cognitive factors<br>
- the paper argues *cognitive factors* are essential to understanding the dynamics of technology evolution.
</p>

<p>
- behind cognitive lens is the idea from Weick (1995): in ambiguous circumstances, actors need to make sense of the situation before they can act
</p>

<p>
791
</p>

<p>
- cognition received increasing attention in the broader field of organizational theory (DiMaggio 1997; Huff, 1990; Lant, 2002; Walsh, 1995)<br>
- but research on technology life cycle has been largely silent about cognition's role
</p>

<p>
The model we develop focuses on how the technological frames (Acha, 2004; Orlikowski and Gash, 1994) of a wide array of actors shape the technological trajectory over the life cycle.
</p>

<p>
We propose that diverse technological frames are a source of variation in the era of ferment, that framing activities help drive the achievement of a dominant design when one emerges, and that the intertwining of technological frames and organizational architecture in the era of incremental change can explain why transitions are so difficult.
</p>

<p>
We use the word "technology" in the tradition of the technology life cycle literature, to mean technology as applied in a particular product context and as embodied in a physical artifact. So technology is not just the knowledge from which products are elaborated, but also includes the physical manifestation of that knowledge within a product. 
</p>

<p>
- key contributions: <br>
<ol type="1" start="1">
<li>using cognitive factors to refine our understanding of why technologies evolve along a particular path over the course of the life cycle: identifies conditions under which applying a cognitive lens might change the expected technological outcome predicted by purely economic or organizational models</li>
<li>applying such a cognitive lens to technological change foregrounds the importance of interactions among the frames of multiple sets of actors in the process; we suggest that the technological frames of producers, users, and institutional actors all need to be considered in understanding technology evolution</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
<span class="zim-tag">@HOXNOTE</span>: can an individual hold multiple frames and switch between them? Could that explain some of Mäkinen's behavior?
</p>

<p>
A collective technological frame is an essential dimension of the dominant design, and it structures further developments in the field. This model thus provides a co-evolutionary perspective on the interpretive dynamics that contribute to the direction of a technology takes. 
</p>

<p>
## A cognitive model of technology trajectories
</p>

<p>
The examination of cognition in the managerial arena goes back at least to March and Simon (1958), who argued that everyone in an organization brings a certain cognitive foundation, a set of givens, to any management decision - assumptions about the future, knowledge about alternatives and a view of the consequences of pursuing each alternative.
</p>

<p>
Confronted with a highly complex and uncertain environment that does not transmit clear and easily recognizable signals, actors use these givens, or frames, to form simplified representations of the information environment. 
</p>

<p>
By frame, we mean the lens through which actors reduce the complexity of the environment in order to be able to focus on particular features, make context-specific interpretations, decide, and act (Goffman, 1974).
</p>

<p>
... 
</p>

<p>
Specifically, technological frames shape how actors categorize a technology relative to other technologies and which performance criteria they use to evaluate the technology. Said differently, a technological frame guides the actor's interpretation of what a technology is and whether it does anything useful.
</p>

<p>
792
</p>

<p>
- most research on technical change has focused primarily on the role of producers' actions in shaping the direction a technology takes<br>
- interaction between users and producers has been largely neglected
</p>

<p>
- the paper argues that a more complete understanding of the evolution of technology requires us to consider the technological frames of producers, users, and institutions, and their interactions with each other
</p>

<p>
<span class="zim-tag">@HOXNOTE</span>: Constraints are "manifestations" or "virtual artifacts" in these interactions? Or one of several manifestations? 
</p>

<p>
Technological frames do not influence technologies directly but rather through the interpretive processes of these actors. Managerial cognition research has conceptualized organizations as interpretive systems that notice, interpret, decide and act in response to the environment (Daft and Weick, 1984; Gioia, 1986; Ocasio, 1997). We argue that in the case of technology evolution it is the technological frames that shape what is noticed, how actors attribute meaning to the information and how these interpretations are translated into decisions and action.
</p>

<p>
- empirical evidence for the interpretative process: research has shown that cognition can shape firm strategic choice and action during periods of environmental change (Barr, 1998; Cho and Hambrick, 2006). 
</p>

<p>
A few studies have focused specifically on responses to technical change. 
</p>

<p>
- Polaroid's choice of commercialization strategy driven by beliefs resident in the analog photography business (Tripsas and Gavetti, 2000)<br>
- Shift from print to online newspapers (Gilbert, 2006)<br>
- pharmaceutical firmsä responses to the emergence of biotechnology (Kaplan et al., 2003)<br>
- communications technology firms' responses to fiber optics (Kaplan, in press)
</p>

<p>
- less empirical evidence exists for dynamics for users and institutional actors
</p>

<p>
<span class="zim-tag">@HOXNOTE</span>: my research could show how even physical constraints - often thought to be exogenous - arise from technological frames
</p>

<p>
###Technological frames and technology evolution
</p>

<p>
- proposes a cognitive model of technology trajectories<br>
- focus on the reciprocal and mutually constituting dynamics among three components:
</p>

<p>
<ol type="1" start="1">
<li>actors' technological frames and interpretative processes</li>
<li>a collective technological frame</li>
<li>evolution of technology</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
In the model, actors' interactions both shape and are shaped by the emerging collective technological frame
</p>

<p>
793
</p>

<p>
Collective technological frames do not emerge fully formed - and sometimes do not emerge at all. We argue that they are the product of interactions among the various actors' competing technological frames.
</p>

<p>
Given the different backgrounds of salient actors and the high levels of uncertainty a new technology poses, actors' technological frames are likely to be varied and conflicting. As a result, actors' interactions can be highly political as they attempt to get their own technological frame to predominate in the industry.
</p>

<p>
These kinds of political struggles resemble those identified in social movements research in which framing processes are a means to foment collective action around a particular set of ideas (Benford and Snow, 2000; McAdam et al., 1996). Contestation is an essential part of the process by which collective technological frames emerge and shape the evolution of technology. 
</p>

<p>
Technological frames influence actors' technical choices, which are the direct mechanism by which the technology evolves. ... The technological frame that actors apply to the situation will thus shape these choices, and it is in this way that the frame influences outcomes. 
</p>

<p>
(Choices: investing in technology or not, adopting or not, supporting or not)
</p>

<p>
At the same time, the technology itself both constrains and enables possible interpretations. Certain understandings of a technology may lead to greater support for a particular direction, but if the realities of the technology do not ultimately play out in the way anticipated (e.g., if certain performance criteria are not achievable), then that incongruity will force actors to switch away from the original technological frame to a new understanding of what the technology is and what performance criteria should be applied.
</p>

<p>
- example: the failure of biotechnology to satisfy pharma firms initial efforts to create large molecule drugs caused those firms to reframe biotechnology as a research method for locating small molecule drugs (Kaplan and Murray, in press)
</p>

<p>
794
</p>

<p>
Technological evolution may also enable users to discover other applications for the technology (Dowell et al., 2002; von Hippel, 1986; Yates, 1993) resulting in new interpretations by other actors.
</p>

<p>
The interactions among the various actors may eventually construct a collective frame (Porac et al., 2001) as well as shape technological evolution. 
</p>

<p>
The achievement of a dominant design and evolution along a particular trajectory will thus involve both the resolution of competing technological frames and of competing technologies. 
</p>

<p>
## Applying a cognitive model of technology trajectories to understanding stages in the technology life cycle
</p>

<p>
- defines the technology life cycle in terms of the four standard stages: an era of ferment (variation), a dominant design (selection), an era of incremental change (retention), and a technological discontinuity, which sparks a new era of ferment (Anderson and Tushman, 1990; Tushman and Smith, 2002; Tushman and Rosenkopf, 1992)
</p>

<p>
The empirical robustness of this basic model has been documented in a broad array of industries including watches (Landes, 1969), automobiles (Abernathy, 1978; Utterback and Suarez, 1993), facsimile machines (Baum et al., 1995), typesetters (Tripsas, 1997) and many more. (See Murmann and Frenken, 2006 for an extensive listing of studies)
</p>

<p>
- the next sections show how the technological frames model produces different outcomes to those predicted by other means
</p>

<p>
###The era of ferment
</p>

<p>
- outcomes of interest: the degree and type of technical variation<br>
- mechanisms:<br>
- technical variation is driven by idiosyncratic differences in actors' frames, and by prior affiliations, which guide actors' framing and interpretation of the technology
</p>

<p>
###Dominant design
</p>

<p>
- outcomes of interest: a dominant design is achieved or not, and a particular design becomes it<br>
- mechanisms:<br>
- the resolution of conflicting technological frames into a collective frame is a prerequisite for achievement of a dominant design<br>
- higher levels of interaction among diverse actors increases the likelihood they will converge on a collective frame<br>
- actors may act purposefully to get their own technological frame ot predominate
</p>

<p>
###Era of incremental change
</p>

<p>
- outcomes of interest: inertia develops around the dominant design<br>
- mechanisms:<br>
- collective frames solidify and become intertwined with other systems within firms and within industries<br>
- change is difficult because these links must be broken apart in order to do things differently
</p>

<p>
###Discontinuity
</p>

<p>
- Outcomes of interest: a new technology emerges or not<br>
- mechanisms:<br>
- Entrepreneurial action outside of the collective frame can break the exisitng frame<br>
- continuous problem-solving that highlights an increasing number of anomalies can break the frame
</p>

<p>
(See the nice table at p 795!)
</p>

<p>
796
</p>

<p>
- economic literature treats technical breakthroughs and their variation as coming from exogenous events<br>
- organizations literature undertheorizes the source of technical variation, and it is generally attributed to "stochastic technological breakthroughs"
</p>

<p>
797
</p>

<p>
- the role of institutional actors: they can promote a particular technology or define standards that favor one version of a technology over others
</p>

<p>
- the greater the level of variation in the prior affiliations of actors entering an industry, the greter the degree of technological variation
</p>

<p>
798
</p>

<p>
- economist interpretation of convergence to dominant design: presence of increasing returns to scale from network externalities or economies of scale<br>
- organizational interpretation: social, political and organizational dynamics select dominant designs<br>
- this interpretation is already quite close to acknowledging the role of shared understandings
</p>

<p>
- the authors argue that negotiating a collective technological frame is a necessary part of the process of convergence on a dominant design. 
</p>

<p>
799
</p>

<p>
- incremental innovation: economics argue that the presence of strong network externalities combined with user learning can result in "excess inertia" where movement to a superior, socially optimal technology is thwarted: QWERTY keyboard as example<br>
- organizational scholars attribute inertia to routines: once dominant design is achieved, actors in the market no longer reexamine the underlying design choices about what the technology is or how should it be evaluated.<br>
- change is limited on refining and elaborating existing components in the context of a relatively stable architecture (Henderson and Clark 1990)<br>
- this is path-dependent learning<br>
- actors engage in local search, on "normal" problem-solving activity within the technological paradigm; technical improvements progress in one "painfully obvious" direction
</p>

<p>
- the authors argue that tehre is also a cognitive element of inertia that causes the era of incremental change ot persist: this element is deeply intertwined with the overall system.
</p>

<p>
We propose that both organizational inertia and technological limits are the product of the <b>tight linkages</b> among the collective technological frame, the institutions that embody norms and taken-for-granted beliefs, the interpretive processes of producers and users, and the technology itself. 
</p>

<p>
The dominant design embodies the predominant collective frame. That frame gets embedded in day-to-day routines and communication patterns, and constrains actors' choices. 
</p>

<p>
The stability of this period results in a tightly linked system, with capabilities, routines, incentives and technological frames all working in a common direction (Kaplan and Henderson, 2005). 
</p>

<p>
Technological discontinuity: 
</p>

<p>
- economists have focused on the size and strength of the new technology's network, as well as the cost advantages of a new technology in predicting whether it will displace the old one. Coordination of actors can help them to overcome the excess inertia associated with an existing technology's network, facilitating movement to the new technology (Farrell and Saloner, 1988).<br>
- Organizational scholars have not studied the drivers of a discontiunuity extensively<br>
- new techs assumed to be exogenously determined and the dominant empirical finding is that they are introduced into the industry by outsiders with different capabilities and resources (Cooper and Schendel, 1976; Tushman and Anderson, 1986)<br>
- some have argued that this disruption is triggered when the old technology reaches its natural limits (Fleming, 2001; Sahal, 1981), causing actors to search for solutions in new technological domains
</p>

<p>
<span class="zim-tag">@HOXNOTE</span>: What is a natural limit anyway?
</p>

<p>
- Henderson (1995) has demonstrated that technology's performance limits are more cognitive than purely technical<br>
- this claim is supported by the substantial evidence that commonly accepted limits have often been exceeded when incumbent firms have responded to the emergence of a threatening new technology
</p>

<p>
- one alternative explanation for the timing of discontinuities is radical shifts in user preferences
</p>

<p>
- the authors argue that emergence of discontinuous new technologies has an important cognitive aspect
</p>

<p>
The sources of variation discussed in our discussion of the era of ferment are precisely the forces that cause old technological frames and technologies to lose their salience. New entrants with different technological frames might be able to visualize opportunities that established firms miss. 
</p>

<p>
- while the role of startups as a source of discontinuous technologies is often attributed to their inherent flexibility as small firms (e.g. Aldrich, 1999), we argue that the advantage that new entrants have - both *de novo* startups as well as *de alio* established players coming from other industries - is not just that they are unencumbered by inertia but rather that they see the world through different lenses. <br>
- example by Hounshell (1975): Elisha Gray did not see practical application for telephone, but Bell came from the outside and pursued its commercial potential
</p>

<p>
New technologies are often ignored, at least early on, by existing players in the industry because they do not fit the predominant collective frame. <br>
- evidence: Christensen and Bower's (1996) study of disk drives
</p>

<p>
<span class="zim-tag">@HOXNOTE</span>: should this be challenged?
</p>

<p>
##Discussion
</p>

<p>
We argue not only that technological frames engrain themselves in technologies, but also that technologies constrain and enable the use of frames. Our model is therefore a way to conceptualize the loose coupling between the actor and the environment.
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
While many scholars have previously proposed research agendas related to managerial cognition in general (Huff, 1997; Meindl et al., 1994; Stubbart, 1989; Walsh, 1995), cognition's role in explaining the dynamics of technical change has not yet been comprehensively explored. 
</p>

<p>
- there is little work that takes into account linkages across the interpretive processes of producers, users and institutional actors
</p>

<p>
###Cognition matters
</p>

<p>
- cognition matters differentially during the technology's life cycle<br>
- new technology may require not only radically enw capabilities, but also (or instead?) new frames (Tripsas and Gavetti 2000)<br>
- dominant design will emerge only to the extent that a collective technological frame is achieved<br>
- collective technological frame becomes more embedded in the industry, and features collectively about the "architecture" of the organization or industry (Henderson and Clark, 1990)
</p>

<p>
###History matters
</p>

<p>
A cognitive model of technology trajectories also implies that path dependence, to the extent it is observed, is an accomplished result rather than a deterministic driver of outcomes. Trajectories have been traditionally described as "compulsive sequences" (Rosenberg, 1969) in which one change then makes the next appear obvious, and path dependence as the effect of change actions that become determinative (David, 1992; Stinchcombe, 1968). This literature proposes that the mechanism of entrainment is a rational cost benefit analysis based on the current situation at any point in time. *Ex ante,* the outcomes are indeterminant. Outcomes may be seen as suboptimal *ex post.*
</p>

<p>
Consistent with recent research on "path creation" (Garud and Karnøe, 2001), we suggest, however, that actors are capable of purposeful actions that affect the direction of evolution by shaping the technological frames of other actors. From this perspective, there is no historical accident but rather "mindful deviation" from existing ways of doing things. This process produces new technological frames that guide further action and thus make particular steps appear obvious after the fact. History matters, but in different ways than those attributed to it in current evolutionary theories. And, as such, the past is more appropriately seen as a source of potential frames rather than a deterministic driver of outcomes (Flaherty and Fine, 2001). It is the manner that history gets drawn upon by the actors as they construct their technological frames that affects the path of development. It may therefore be useful to think of cognition in the way that Swidler (1986) talks about culture, where the past accumulates in a repertoire (or "tool kit") of frames that get activated depending on context and interactions. The multiplicity of technological frames within a field makes alternative paths possible. In our model, the "path" is shaped by the ways in which interactions among<br>
802<br>
the interpretive processes of multiple actors play out over time.
</p>

<p>
###Multiple actors matter
</p>

<p>
- most extant research examined only one actor at time, not their interactions
</p>

<p>
Such an interactional view would suggest, first, that it is risky to examine how producing firms react to technical changes without acknowledging that their reactions also shape the very nature of the change itself or that user interpretations of the technology might move it in directions entirely unanticipated by the producer. Thus, harkening back to the debate about the relative merits of demand-pull or technology-push theories (Mowery and Rosenberg, 1982), we suggest that both market pull and technology push have independent roles in technology evolution and that this occurs through the interaction of the interpretive processes of producers (push) and users (pull) and is mediated by institutional actors.
</p>

<p>
- sheds new insight on user innovation: users may innovate when their frame for understanding a new technology differs significantly from that of its producers; in these situations, users may be best positioned to create products consistent with their vision of how the technology should develop.
</p>

<p>
Third, we emphasize the role of institutions as both actors and arenas in which the interactions of other actors can take place (e.g. through standards bodies). Because collective technological frames only emerge from interactions, the rpesence of various industry institutions that draw actors together can accelerate or amplify these efforts. Actors may purposefully create institutions (e.g. user groups or industry associations) precisely to have a forum for their framing activities
</p>

<p>
- multiple levels of analysis can be used in the study of cognitive mechanisms for shaping technical outcomes
</p>

<p>
Further research could explore the ways that the mechanisms that we propose in our cognitive model of technical change would manifest themselves at these different levels of analysis.
</p>

<p>
###Methodological implications
</p>

<p>
- new methodological approaches needed; simultaneously longitudinal and cross-sectional, or paired comparisons, are most likely to shed light on cognition and technical change<br>
- the most problematic aspect is the risk of retrospective reconstruction: the uncertainty during eras of ferment and the achievement of clarity only after the fact mean that *ex post* efficiency explanations are inappropriate<br>
- this concern has two methodological implications:<br>
<ol type="1" start="1">
<li>the need to present a "symmetric account of different paths irrespective of whether or not they were eventually successful" (Garud and Rappa 1994:348)</li>
<li>the importance of using contemporary data sources</li>
</ol>
