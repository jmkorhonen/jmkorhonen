Abstract
</p>

<p>
Although environmental philosophy and human exploration of space share common beginnings, scholars from either field have not given adequate attention to the possible connections between them. In this essay, we seek to spur the rapprochement and cross-fertilization of philosophy and space policy by highlighting the philosophic dimensions of space exploration, pulling together issues and authors that have had insufficient contact with one another. We do so by offering an account of three topics: planetary exploration, planetary protection and the search for extraterrestrial life, and terraforming. The resulting synthesis seeks to change our thinking about earthbound environmental ethics as it considers the philosophical dimensions of space exploration, and introduces the possible benefits of a humanities-oriented approach to space policy.
</p>

<p>
136
</p>

<p>
- environmental ethics has its beginning at the same time as the space program
</p>

<p>
But despite the silence of philosophers (including environmental philosophers) on the subject, there is in fact a powerful link between our exploration of space, the reflections it elicits concerning the fate of our home planet, and the development of environmental ethics. 
</p>

<p>
- argues that our thinking about both the future habitability of the planet ethics and the exploration of space is sharpened by bringing the two into more explicit contact
</p>

<p>
- early explorations on the state of the planet were prompted by the work of scientists, not philosophers<br>
- works of Carson and Ehrlich (1962 and 68) shared a common rhetoric: ethical *cri de coeur* built on the supposedly objective foundation of science
</p>

<p>
For example, Carson's claim that the effects of DDT radiated throughout the environment causing reproductive problems and death was quickly taken up as an argument for viewing nature as a web of life we needed to nurture and protect.
</p>

<p>
137
</p>

<p>
- environmental ethics gained a foothold in academia only in the 1980s; first course taught by J. Baird Callicott at the University of Wisconsin, Stevens Point in 1971<br>
- even now, environmental ethics remains a stepchild of philosophy, marginal within the bulk of programs and departments
</p>

<p>
- space exploration contributed to the birth of environmental consciousness
</p>

<p>
Even the scientific discovery of the importance of asteroid impacts in Earth's history (c. 1981) and the imminent impact of global climate change have done little to encourage reflection on Earth within an extraterrestrial context (note 1: recent philosophical work done on questions surrounding climate change, e.g. Gardner 2004: Ethics and Global Climate Change, Frodeman 2006: the Policy Turn in Environmental Philosophy). 
</p>

<p>
- Eugene Hargrove's edited volume, Beyond Spaceship Earth: Environmental Ethics and the Solar System (1986) was the first and remains the best effort at thinking about the philosophical issues regarding humans' use of and relationship to outer space<br>
- Philosophers Robert Ginsberg (1972: The Future of Interplanetary Ethics), William K. Hartmann (1984: Space Exploration and Environmental Issues), Doland Scherer (1982), and Lewis Beck White (1998) have also published on these topics from the early years of space exploration<br>
- but this literature is still limited, both in terms of scope and frequency of publication
</p>

<p>
138
</p>

<p>
While issues such as the possible biological contamination of other planets and space debris have clear ethical dimensions, the expansion of our understanding of the cosmos through instruments such as the Hubble Space Telescope is much more a mater of aesthetics (e.g., Hubble's stunning pictures) and metaphysics (our growing appreciation of the long view of cosmic history) than ethics. Humans tend to acknowledge ethical responsibilities to what is close at hand. The thought of environmental ethics in outer space, where few will go in our lifetimes and nothing is known to live, is quite simply unfathomable to most. But despite all this, the cosmic environment continues to awe, delight, and inspire generation after generation.
</p>

<p>
##Planetary exploration
</p>

<p>
Lessons learned about our impact on the Earth's surface and atmosphere have relevance as we travel beyond our home planet. The unintended and often destructive effects of humankind on the Earth environment highlight the need for caution and restraint as we travel beyond our home planet. Several authors, acknowledging the probability that humans will one day be active and constant presences in space, have suggested the need to identify and preserve wilderness areas on celestial and planetary bodies. (note 4: See William Hartmann 1984, Uhlir and Bishop 1986, Cockell and Horneck 2004, Spennemann 2004)<br>
- e.g. Cockell and Horneck (2004)
</p>

<p>
140
</p>

<p>
To date, the discussion of natural places has turned on questions concerning intrinsic and instrumental values. Intrinsic values theorists claim that things have value for their own sake, in contrast to theories of instrumental value where things are good because they can be used to obtain something else of value (economic or otherwise). 
</p>

<p>
- but both anthropocentric and geocentric environmental perspective begin to show cracks when we try to extend it to the cosmic environment
</p>

<p>
...
</p>

<p>
Anticipating the need for policy decisions regarding space exploration, Mark Lupisella and John Logsdon suggest the possibility of a *cosmocentric* ethic, "one which (1) places the universe at the center, or establishes the universe as the priority in a value system, (2) appeals to something characteristic of the universe (physical and/or metaphysical) which might then (3) provide a justification of value, presumably intrinsic value, and (4) allow for reasonably objective measurement of value." (Lupisella and Logsdon 1997:1) ... suggest that a cosmocentric ethic would provide a justification for a conservative approach to space exploration and science - conservative in the sense of considering possible impacts before we act.

##Planetary protection and the search for extraterrestrial life
</p>

<p>
- contamination
</p>

<p>
146
</p>

<p>
- on terraforming:<br>
Few philosophers have approached the question - the majority of literature considering the ethics of such a project has been written by scientists. Those who have written about the ethical implications of terraforming (both scientists and philosophers) have tended to appeal to the intrinsic value issues involved in introducing terrestrial life to Mars. The questions usually take the following forms: Is life better than non-life? Is there value in nature absent the presence of life? Should we preserve the natural state of the red planet, or might we have an ethical obligation to populate the universe?
</p>

<p>
The answer to the last question is often a qualified yes. David Grinspoon likens the issue to that of planting a garden in a vacant lot -- if no life exists on Mars, then we have the duty to bring life to it: "Mars belongs to us [life] because this universe belongs to life" (Grinspoon 2004). Of course, a vacant lot is a human creation, and thus is a questionable analogy to a planet which happens to be naturally abiotic. Christopher McKay voices a similar position: "Life has precedence over non-life," he states; "life has value. A planet Mars with a natural global-scale biota has value *vis-avis* a planet with only sparse life or none at all" (McKay 1990). 
</p>

<p>
- Zubrin (2002): called the argument that we should forgo the terraforming project if native life is found on Mars "immoral and insane," because humans are more important than bacteria. "In securing the Red Planet on behalf of life, humans will perform an act of improving creation so dramatic that it will affirm the value of the human race, and every member of it. There could be no activity more ethical. "Zubrin 2002:179-180). 
</p>

<p>
- no universal approval: Rolston is an advocate of the "hands-off" approach or cosmic preservationsim<br>
- he assigns value to the "creative projects" of nature, regardless of the existence of life or consciousness<br>
-147<br>
"Humans ought to preserve projects of formed integrity, whenever found..." [We should] "banish soon and forever the bias that only habitable places are good ones, and all uninhabitable places empty wastes, piles of dull stones, dreary, desolate swirls of gases" (Rolston 1986:170-171
</p>

<p>
Alan Marshall, another preservationist, advocates strict enforcement measures to ensure that the planet continues to exist in its natural state. For Marshall, all of nature should receive respect: rocks, for instance, exist in "a blissful state of satori only afforded to non-living entities" (Marshall 1993)
</p>

<p>
Martyn Fogg, on the other hand, notes that efforts to protect a barren environment are often misanthropic critiques of human nature emphasizing our capacity for evil, or sentimental illusions based on out-of-date ecology. He offers as an example the ecocentrist notion of ecological harmony -- "that there exist an ideal balance in nature that is perfect, unchanging, and which nurtures and sustains" (Fogg 2000a, 209: The ethical dimensions of space settlement). Such a state is a cozy sentimentality, he claims. "Nature is...better regarded as a continuous state of flux dominated by chaos and disharmony" (ibid.). Fogg counters Alan Marshall's argument that rocks exist in a state of "blissful satori" by stating, "rocks don't think, don't act and don't care. They cannot have values of their own" (ibid, 210). 
</p>

<p>
The question, however, of whether e.g., rocks have intrinsic value is different from whether they have values of their own. Abiotic nature can also have value through the *relatedness* of nature and natural objects to human beings. This value resides in the daily presence of humans in nature, humans as part of nature -- something not (yet) true of the extraterrestrial world. We may be confident that rocks do not think, or have values of their own. But humans can nonetheless value rocks for their own sake -- they can be experienced as beautiful, sublime, or sacred. Metaphysical, aesthetic, and theological questions such as these must be included as we address issues of terraforming. 
</p>

<p>
##Conclusion: toward a humanities policy of space exploration
</p>

<p>
Revolutions in philosophic understanding and cultural worldviews inevitably accompany revolutions in science. As we expand our exploration of the heavens, we will also reflect on the broader human implications of advances in space. Moreover, our appreciation of human<br>
148<br>
impact on Earth systems will expand as we come to see the Earth within the context of the solar system. Most fundamentally, we need to anticipate and wrestle with the epistemological, metaphysical, and theological dimensions of space exploration, including the possibility of extraterrestrial life and the development of the space environment, as it pertains to our common understanding of the universe and of ourselves.
