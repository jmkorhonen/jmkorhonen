 A small literature exists on the impact of actual environmental regulations on compliance innovation and clean technology:<br>
 Ashford and Heaton (1980s, US)<br>
 emp (1997)<br>
 artje 1985<br>
 emmelskamp 1997<br>
 lemmer 1999<br>
 The focus of these studies is on technical, not organizational innovation.<br>
 hey show that the technology responses vary:<br>
  diffusion of existing technology<br>
  incremental changes in processes<br>
  product reformulation to product substitution<br>
  the development of new processes<br>
 The most common responses to regulation are incremental innovation in processes and products and diffusion of existing technology (in the form of end-of-pipe solutions and non-innovative substitutions of existing substances). Often, the new technologies are developed by firms outside the regulated industry, which means that, in the past, industry was reliant upon suppliers, capital goods suppliers and environmental technology suppliers. (This is changing with the growing attention in environmental policy and industry to prevention and product change.) 
</p>

<p>
 The studies also show, unsurprisingly, that the stringency of the regulation is an important determinant of the degree of innovation, with stringent regulations such as product bans being necessary for radical technology responses. 
</p>

<p>
 Technology-forcing standards appear to be a necessary condition for bringing about innovative compliance responses. The studies also show that long before the regulations are promulgated there is a search process for solutions to the problem, both by the regulated industry (mostly for defensive reasons), their suppliers and outsiders. This happened in the case of PCBs and CFCs where firms both in and outside the chemical industry were looking for substitutes ten years before the use of PCBs and CFCs was banned (Ashford et al. 1985). Of course, the certainty that their product or activity would be subject to regulations was an important factor. <br>
 36<br>
 As to the nature (incremental or radical, product- or process-related) and the source of technological solutions, an internal OECD report established that:<br>
 - High volume, mature sectors were resistant to change, although very amenable to environmental monitoring and process controls that improved efficiency. This fits with the Abernathy-Utterback product life cycle model that during the life time of a product a sector becomes rigid, especially those sectors that are capital intensive. An alternative explanation is that such sectors are powerful and able to fight off regulations that require a major change in their process technologies.<br>
  Significant process innovations occurred in response to stringent regulations that gave firms in the regulated industry enough time to develop comprehensive strategies. There is a trade-off between achieving quick results and radical change.<br>
  Smaller firms and potential new entrants tended to develop more innovative responses. A possible explanation for this is that incumbent firms, especially the big ones, are vested in old technologies - both economically and mentally.<br>
  The environmental goods and services industry provided compliance strategies that were at best incrementally innovative but which diffused fast due to their lack of disruption and acceptability to regulators.<br>
  Regulatory flexibility towards the means of compliance, variation in the requirements imposed on different sectors, and compliance time periods were aspects of performance standards that contributed to the development of superior technological responses.<br>
 What the studies show is that technology responses are not a simple response to regulatory pressure. Apart from the regulatory stimulus, many other factors exercised influence. This suggests that the simulus-response model is too simple. For one thing, it assumes that social innovation starts with regulation, which is most often not the case. Regulation is not the be-all and end-all of social innovation. The knowledge for such innovations is usually available, regulations may provide the leverage or some extra stimulus for the exploitation. Regulation is but one of many stimuli. It may, in fact, not be needed for environmental innovation. Many technologies producing environmental benefits are adopted for normal business reasons of reducing costs and enhancing product quality. These options are referred to as eco-efficiency options. However, even for environmentally beneficial technologies that do not combine environmental gains with economic gains, regulation may not be needed.<br>
  other pressures e.g. environmentalists<br>
 ... The voicing of concern and the threat of regulation may be enough to induce industry to look for alternative solutions. This does not absolve the need for regulation. Regulation will be needed for the widespread diffusion of environmental technologies.<br>
 One should be careful in using regulation for promoting innovation. Given the information problem of the government, the threat of regulation may be a better means to stimulate technological innovation than actual regulations (Rip and Kemp 1998). It is hard to craft regulations that are not disruptive in some sense. Environmental innovations, like any other type of innovation, must meet a variety of goals: they should be expendable; <br>
 7<br>
 t should be possible to fit them into existing processes; and, in the case of products, they should meet user requirements in terms of performance characteristics.<br>
 ...<br>
 For example, it proved to be very difficult to develop phosphate-free detergents with equal washing power to the phosphate-based ones. In the search for a phosphate substitute detergent, companies spent more than USD 250 million. The current regulations on phosphate content co-evolved with the results of product tests (both toxicological tests and tests comparing washing performance) (Hartje 1985)<br>
 The example of detergents shows that innovations can not simply be "elicited by legal fiat" (Heaton 1990). This fits with insights from technology studies which say that technology can not be moulded in a pre-defined, socially desirable shape. This is why emission limits are based on assessments about what is technologically possible and economically affordable, and why environmental permits are often based on the concept of Best Available Technology or Best Practicable Means that are specified in BAT lists or guidance notes for permitting agents. There is a dynamic interplay between innovation and regulation, with innovations often paving the way for regulations. The stimulus response model fails to appreciate this dynamic interplay and circular causality. <br>
 The obvious implication of all this is that the governance of technical change is not a simple matter. It is difficult to design instruments that do the job and do it well - in the sense that society as a whole is better off. <br>
 40<br>
 ...<br>
 Turning to the topic of best policies to promote the development of environmental innovation and diffusion, there are two ways to approach this issue. One way is to focus on policy instruments and examine for what purposes (stimulation of innovation or diffusion or both) and context in which they may be usefully applied. This is what the author has done in a previous publication (Kemp 1997). Another way to approach the issue is to take the dynamics of socio-technical change (including processes of assessment and anticipation) as the starting point for a discussion of governance: how can these be modulated into<br>
 1<br>
 ore environmentally nening directions? The second approach has been explored by the author with Arie Rip (Rip and Kemp 1996) and in the two Duch projects in which the author is involved: the MATRIC and PRET projects. It uses the evolutionary view described in Dosi et al. (1988), Nelson (1994), Freeman (1992), Edquist (1997), Lipsey and Carlaw (1998), Metcalfe and Georghiou (1998), Rip and Kemp (1998), Kemp et al (1997 and 1998), Schot (1998), and Smith (2000).<br>
 The pros and cons of environmental policy instruments<br>
 ...<br>
 Environmental standards<br>
 As the previous section made clear, from an innovation point of view the experiences with environmental policies are mixed, and often negative. Emission standards were often based on available end-of-pipe technologies and provided little incentive for the development of new, more effective technologies; they merely stimulated the diffusion of existing technologies. This demonstrates the danger of using technology-based standards and the importance of taking a long-term view towards environmental protection.<br>
 Technology-forcing standards that require the development of new technologies are a better way of encouraging technological innovation, as the regulatory experiences in the United States demonstrate. However, they may impose high costs on industry unless the regulator is willing to soften and delay standards - although this will have a negative effect on the willingness of suppliers to develop innovations. Technology-forcing standards should only be used when technological opportunities are available that can be developed at sufficiently low cost.<br>
 In using standards, it is important that the regulator gives industry enough time to develop solutions that are environmentally benign and meet important user requirements. Time may also be needed to examine whether a solution is environmentally benign and does not pose other hazards. One way of dealing with the problem of compliance time is by giving firms innovation waivers that exempt them from regulations during a certain period. If innovation waivers are used, it is important that firms are given sufficiently long time allowances and that the eligibility criteria are clear. Another strategy is the setting of long-term standards that require the development of new technology.
