- it would be wrong to disqualify electric vehicle (EV) development, although it has not resulted (and will likely not result to) market breakthrough, at least in the short term: the development of EVs has put the pressure on the car industry and other actors to improve existing automobile technology<br>
- also, hybrid and fuel cell vehicles share the same electric drive technology
</p>

<p>
- Battery powered EV:s (BPEVs) are an example of 
</p>

<p>
...experimental introduction in society, in which a new technology is exposed to the criticism, preferences and whims of users, citizens organisations, the media and other parties outside the company or research institute.
</p>

<p>
- Hoogma uses the concepts of technological niches and regimes to analyse the empirical material about electric vehicle development and promotion
</p>

<p>
Research in the field of technology dynamics has shown that new technologies - both radically new technologies and new applications of existing technologies (2) emerge in technological niches (Rip 1995; Schot, Slob and Hoogma 1996; Schot 1998; Levinthal 1998)
</p>

<p>
Technological niches: <br>
...specfic domains for application of a new technology functioning as a test bed, where the new technologies or concepts are (temporarily and selectively shielded<br>
14<br>
from the pressures of the market and institutions and from the dominant technological regime.
</p>

<p>
Rip and Kemp (1998:340) define a technological regime as:
</p>

<p>
"the rule-set or grammar embedded in a complex of engineering practices, production process technologies, product characteristics, skills and procedures, ways of handling relevant artifacts and persons, ways of defining problems - all of them embedded in institutions and infrastructures.
</p>

<p>
The occurence of such technological regimes helps to explain why most technical change is of an incremental nature rather than of a radical nature. The regime narrows down the type of technological solutions considered feasible and desirable by developers, potential users and regulators, to those solutions that are most compatible with the regime.
</p>

<p>
HOX HOX! Voisiko tätä käyttää jotenkin selittämään, miksi tiettyjä ratkaisuja ja ei toisia kehitetään niukkuuden oloissa?
</p>

<p>
In a situation where the regime poses an unfavourable environment for the development and diffusion of a radical technology, motivated actors who want to promote the technology for their own or societal benefit, need to protect it from the usual decision calculus of managers, potential users and regulators. It requires the creation of a technological niche, a "space" within the regime, where the new technology can be protected from disadvantageous selection criteria defined by the regime. This means that the exposure of the technology to the selection environment is selective and controlled. The technology can thus be nurtured until it is mature and can survive in the selection environment.
</p>

<p>
15
</p>

<p>
- the difference between market and technological niches:
</p>

<p>
Market niches are application domains in which a novel technology has some specific advantages over the established technology. Both producers and users recognise this. The still crude new technology and the user preferences need to be developed further, but it is already clear that the new technology can suit the needs of the application domain. Technological niches can be seen as proto-market niches. 
</p>

<p>
- introduction of new technologies can be described as a sequence of niche developments
</p>

<p>
In the process, technologies are often combined with complementary technologies and with new use concepts that can open up new domains of application. This means that one needs to take developments in a wide range of fields into account to understand the introduciton process of the technology of interest.
</p>

<p>
16
</p>

<p>
- strategic niche management: building on the on-going dynamics of sociotechnical change and to exert pressure so as to modulate these dynamics of change into desirable directions<br>
- in this strategy, the task for policy-makers is to stimulate that the co-evolution of supply and demand produces desirable outcomes, in both the short run and longer term. <br>
- rather than laying down requirements, they need to engage in process management to keep the process of sociotechical change going in a desired direction.
</p>

<p>
17
</p>

<p>
Kemp, Schot and Hoogma (1998:186) have defined strategic niche management as:
</p>

<p>
"the creation, development and controlled phase-out of protected spaces for the development and use of promising technologies by means of experimentation, with the aim of (1) learning about the desirability of the new technology and (2) enhancing the further development and the rate of application of the new technology."
</p>

- a typical electric pleasure vehicle in 1900:<br>
- weigh 1150 kg (including 500 kg of batteries)<br>
- range 55 km on a level road<br>
- consumed 90 Wh/km with three persons on board<br>
- the specific energy of the battery (in Wh/kg) was not much lower than that of lead-acid batteries available in the 1990s; the main improvements over the decades were easier maintenance and longer battery life<br>
- the higher speeds and frequent accelerations of today's urban and highway driving has offset the gains made in energy efficiency of electric vehicles, so that a lead-acid battery powered vehicle of today has about the same range as one hundred years ago (Fogelberg 1997:30-31)
</p>

<p>
30
</p>

<p>
Fogelberg (1997:32) quotes a contemporary observer, who wrote that
</p>

<p>
"Anyone who is familiar with the condition of the art and with the character of the product of the various types of motor vehicles [i.e. steam, petrol, electric], cannot doubt the wide field [i.e. use in cities] that the electric vehicle will cover. (23)"
</p>

<p>
- EVs were exclusive and expensive vehicles for city rich; gasoline cars built for countryside touring, speed and endurance had an image of youthfulness, adventure and novelty <br>
- early endurance races were much more popular than speed races, where EVs performed better
</p>

<p>
31
</p>

<p>
Another barrier for diffusion of electric vehicles was that until 1905 no good inverters were available, so that electric vehicles could only be used in areas with direct current and not alternate current (Abt 1998:332)
</p>

<p>
- hybrid cars were developed as early as 1899 in both series and parallel hybrid types; these were not successful as they were heavy and inefficient
</p>

<p>
33
</p>

<p>
A 1913 MIT report compared the relative costs of commercial vehicles propelled by electricity, gasoline and horses. It showed that the horse was somewhat cheaper on a cost per day basis, but the cost per mile driven or cost per delivery made was 75-85% lower for electric vehicles than gasoline cars and horse-drawn vehicles. (Fogelberg 1997:40)
</p>

<p>
- in 1914, there were 40 000 EVs in USA, and only a few thousand in Europe (Mom and Van der Vinne 1995:169)
</p>

<p>
35
</p>

<p>
Three developments were probably most significant in the resurgence of EVs since the late 1980s. 
</p>

<p>
- the emergence of lightweight vehicle milieus in different countries, esp. Switzerland, Germany, Denmark and the US (from solar cars to EVs)<br>
- the Californian zero-emissions mandate<br>
- the automobile industry frequently presented EV prototypes
