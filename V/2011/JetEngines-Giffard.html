“The well-known German lead in jet production and deployment was not the natural result of the country’s technical lead, nor of the new aero-engine’s superiority to existing, out-numbered piston-engines, but rather of the country’s desperate position at the end of the war. The jet engines that Germany produced were much easier to build than existing piston engines, requiring only a fraction of the man-hours and material. They were not wonder weapons, but ersatz ones.”
</p>

<p>
“…large-scale manufacture of engines of desperation.”
</p>

<p>
17
</p>

<p>
“…jet engines took about five years to develop to the point of first production, about the same amount of time as the gestation of a new piston engine, contrary to optimistic, early hopes in industry and government.”
</p>

<p>
“One of the reasons that the aero-engine industry was able to take up the new type of engine so effectively was because the new engines could be designed by combining independent elements — many of which the industry was already familiar with.”
</p>

<p>
19
</p>

<p>
“…unlike Germany later in the war, Britain deemphasised production in favour of a broad development programme. By the end of the war, despite having produced a smaller number of production engines than the Germans, Britain boasted both the most developed jet engines and the most varied jet engine programme in the world. This encompassed all of the country’s aero-engine makers and included the work of Rolls-Royce, which led the world market in large jet engines after the war. So it was that, in contrast to the German V1 and V2 that spawned post-war American military missile and rocket projects, American aero-engine firms did not in the post-war period turn to confiscated Herman jet engines as a basis for future development but instead licensed British jet engines with wartime heritages.”
</p>

<p>
20
</p>

<p>
“The point of telling the story of the jet engine with these key inventive institutions at the end is to understand invention not as the precursor to development and production, as it is usually treated, but much more broadly as an extended activity in the context of development and production, constantly impacted by development and production decisions. Novelty did not appear through the work of unique inventors in rarefied places, but was carried out in the same kinds of places as and through the work of the same kinds of people who were engaged in development and production.”
</p>

<p>
21
</p>

<p>
“The construction of the British jet inventor is one persuasive example of how the literature’s focus on individuals and corporate laboratories as the most important sources of novelty in the twentieth-century has misled historians.”
</p>

<p>

<p>
Interwar literature on innovation<br>
- formal study of invention in the 20th century inaugurated most famously by a group of American sociologists<br>
- “sociology of invention”<br>
- Gilfillan, of Ogburn school, <br>
- Ogburn’s school studied invention as a way to explain a central sociological problem of the day: the observed differences between cultures<br>
- rejected then-popular racialist-biological explanations for cultural differences<br>
- argued instead that humanity had common intellectual capacities<br>
- this led them to favour a determinist theory of invention, in which invention occurred everywhere through the combination of elements from a shared cultural base
</p>

<p>
(More subtly than the ‘cultural lag’ thesis for which he is more generally known, Ogburn argued both that culture influenced invention and that invention influenced culture. (McGee, ‘Making up Mind,’ 773-801.))
</p>

<p>
- the key piece of evidence: things were commonly invented by multiple people<br>
- William Ogburn and Dorothy Thomas argued in a 1922 paper that the frequent existence of “duplicate inventions or discoveries”, which they empirically illustrated with 148 examples from a range of fields, suggested that invention must “be explained in cultural and social terms, that is, in terms of sociology and not in terms of biology and psyhology.” (William Ogburn and Dorothy Thomas, ‘Are Inventions Inevitable? A Note on Social Evolution’, Political Science Quarterly 37, no. 1 (1922): 83-98.)
</p>

<p>
(Andrew Jamison, ‘Technology’s Theorists: Conceptions of Innovation in Relation to Science and Technology Policy’, Technology and Culture 30, no. 3 (1989): 505-533.) MacLeod has discussed the work of nineteenth-century theorists. (Christine MacLeod, Heroes of Invention: Technology, Liberalism and British Identity, 1750-1914 (Cambridge: CUP, 2008).)
</p>

<br>

<p>
27
</p>

<p>
29
</p>

<p>
For Gilfillan, the crucial factors were the inventor’s foresight and his social context rather than location or means.
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
- Another interwar history of invention: Usher’s A History of Mechanical Invention (first published in 1929)<br>
- studied invention in order to address the general problem of historical change<br>
- used history of mechanical invention to “securely” establish “many of the primary features of the process” of “the emergence of novelty in thought and action.” Mechanical invention was “broadly representative of every feature of the general process of invention… [and] admits of a more rigorous historical treatment than is possible in many portions of the history of philosophy and the arts.” [Usher1954:56-57] <br>
- rejected the heroic view of invention, but also objected to the determinists’ opposing view<br>
- chose middle ground: building on the work of earlier inventors was fundamental to invention, but in which the individual nevertheless held a crucial place.<br>
- invention was not a heroic feat but a “cumulative accomplishment” that was the result of the “continuous activity of common mental processes” [Usher1954:5-6]
</p>

<p>
32
</p>

<p>
- Robert Merton in 1961 tried to unify the heroic and determinist views of invention in a study presenting the results of an “intensive” study of 264 cases of multiple scientific discoveries (Merton, Robert K. 1957, Priorities in Scientific Discovery: A Chapter in the Sociology of Science, American Sociological Review 22,635-659<br>
Merton, Robert K. <br>
Singletons and Multiples in Scientific Discovery: A Chapter in the Sociology of Science. Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society 105 (1961): 470-486<br>
- Schmookler and Constant attacked the 1961 paper and the work of the earlier sociological school on the grounds that their “multiple inventions” were not meaningfully equivalent. <br>
- “the sociologists’ disregard for not only historical but also technological specificity had led them to false conclusions about the non-importance of the individual inventor”
</p>

<p>
Jacob Schmookler, Invention and Economic Growth (Cambridge, MA: Harvard UP, 1966), 189-195; Edward Constant, ‘On the Diversity and Co-Evolution of Technological Multiples: Steam Turbines and Pelton Water Wheels,’ Social Studies of Science 8 (1987): 183-184. Constant later dismissed the determinist argument as ‘simply wrong’. (Origins of the Turbojet Revolution, 2)

- reverse salients-critical problems method has proved of little analytical use, for the direction of technological change is rarely singular and well-defined.For an example of the concept’s recent descriptive use, see the reference to reverse salients in Karen J. Freeze, ‘Innovation and Technology Transfer During the Cold War: The Case of the Open-End Spinning Machine from Communist Czechoslovakia,’ Technology and Culture 48, no. 2 (2007): 249-285 fn 16.
</p>

<p>
45
</p>

<p>
- Constant’s notion of “technological revolutions” was enthusiastically accepted by some reviewers as a potential theoretical model of invention, but it has found little use beyond Constant’s own study<br>
- overview of the theory:<br>
- “normal technology” is the technology to which a group of technologists are dedicated<br>
- it’s constantly improved through successive series of small changes within the dominant framework<br>
- if a “normal technology” fails, solutions will be sought first within the existing “normal” system<br>
- a “technological revolution” occurs if a group of technologists becomes committed to a new technology, based on completely different assumptions, and successfully displaces the old “normal technology”
</p>

<p>
46
</p>

<p>
- by virtue of “presumptive anomaly,” science and individual were put unreservedly at the heart of radical technological change<br>
- young outsiders without commitment to the conventional technology tend to make radical change
</p>

<p>
47
</p>

<p>
- Constant’s book did not fundamentally reframe the standard turbojet story, or alter its focus on individuals; the most original argument was the central thesis of the book, that the timing of the turbojet revolution in Germany, Britain and America (in that order) can be explained by the character of the study of aerodynamics in each country
</p>

<p>
49
</p>

<p>
- Schlaifer emphasized the critical importance of aero-engine industry in the development of radical new engines<br>
- his work is “well worth revisiting”
</p>

<p>
50
</p>

<p>
- Schlaifer’s key argument: new aero-engines could be most quickly developed by established aero-engine firms because of their wealth of experience and resources<br>
- Schlaifer’s work based only on interviews and published documents
</p>

<p>
58
</p>

<p>
- Scranton called for the need for more contextualised studies of design and production inspired by a more dynamic understanding of the interrelations of development and production
</p>

<p>
59
</p>

<p>
Pavelec’s overall argument was that Germany was the most successful nation at producing jet aircraft and engines because of its extreme need, while the Allies, lacking that spur to achievement, trailed behind.<br>
- shaped by a belief in German technical superiority that built on Constant’s focus on aerodynamics as the key differentiator in the jet engine revolution
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
Chapter 2: Turbojet Production During the Second World War
</p>

<p>
- production during WW2 has not been studied in its own right<br>
- used as a proxy for success in invention and development<br>
- ca. 6600 (production) engines made in Germany through March 45, by the end of 45, the UK made just under 750, the US about 300
</p>

<p>
63
</p>

<p>
- the biggest flaw is unproblematic linking of invention and production<br>
- while invention made production possible, it did not make production necessary or inevitable, <br>
- and it did not define exactly what would be produced<br>
- production does not necessaarily indicate technical achievement, except in a very basic way
</p>

<p>
64
</p>

<p>
…this chapter will show that German production success rested on the turbojet’s character as an ersatz piston engine, a cheaper more easily produced aero-propulsion system. The turbojet engine was not an existing machine passively and detrimentally affected by the many material shortages that afflicted Germany. Rather it was material shortages, including of metals and aviation fuel, that made poor-quality turbojet engines an attractive weapon.<br>
(Pavelec, Jet Race, pages 32 and 97: engines took low-grade fuel, became easier to make over time, and could use inferior materials)
</p>

<p>
65
</p>

<p>
- in Dec 44, just months after full-scale turbojet production had begun, 20% of German aero-engine production was turbojets
</p>

<p>
66
</p>

<p>
Accounts of German production mostly emphasize the country’s success in overcoming its material constraints in light of the country’s high production numbers. (Pavelec 120,155: “lack of strategically important raw materials” was the “main problem faced by Junkers”)
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
In mid-1942, the W.2B was still unreliable and not yet powerful enough to propel the F.9/40 airframe.
</p>

<p>
76
</p>

<p>
In 1941-1942, a strong competitor to the W.2B emerged: the H.1, or Halford turbojet engine, designed by the independent aero-engine designer Frank Halford. The H.1 was designed to reach 3,000 pounds of thrust, almost twice as much as the W.2B. This performance would allow a jet fighter with a single engine to outperform the contemporary Typhoon and Spitfire…<br>
In mid-1942, the H.1 seemed to offer greater thrust, reliability and development potential than the W.2B, despite having been designed less than a year earlier.
</p>

<p>
77
</p>

<p>
- this became the DH Goblin for DH Vampire (DH 100) as E.6/41<br>
- delay with E.6/41 meant H.1 first tested on F.9/40 prototype; in fact, first flight of F.9/40 on 5 March 1943 powered by two H.1s<br>
- for a time, the future of the F.9/40 seemed to be with that engine<br>
- at this point H.1 could produce 2,000 pounds of thrust (67% of design), W.2B could not produce 1450 lb (90% of design thrust)
</p>

<p>
81
</p>

<p>
By 20 February 1943, the W.2B had been put thorugh a 100 hour type test, which included 26 starts, 106 accelerations and 100 hours of running at 1250 lb thrust (78% design) without replacing any parts...
</p>

<p>
82
</p>

<p>
- at 1450 lb thrust, W.2B-Meteor would be good enough for a jet trainer<br>
- at 1600 lb, Meteor would be competitive fighter above 35 000 feet<br>
- at 1750 lb, it would be an “outstanding” fighter
</p>

<p>
- first flight of F.9/40 with W.2B on 12 June 1943<br>
- each produced 1450 lb<br>
- in around Nov 43, limited production of Welland service engines started; cleared for flight at 1600 pounds “with a very respectable time between overhauls of 150 hours”
</p>

<p>
83
</p>

<p>
- Rolls-Royce had little interest in W.2B design:<br>
- it was low-powered and difficult to produce
</p>

<p>
84
</p>

<p>
- Rolls-Royce did not produce the next Power Jets engine, W2/500, as originally planned<br>
- instead designed and produced its own centrifugal turbojet, RB/37 (later named Derwent)<br>
- first prototype completed by June 1943<br>
- by 30 Jan 45, 13 Derwents with ratings of appr. 2000 pounds delivered to Gloster for Meteor Mk III
</p>

<p>
- H.1 did not enjoy from ready-made factory as Derwent did; caused delays
</p>

<p>
85
</p>

<p>
- H.1 was, however, no closer to production than the W.2B, and may have been farther from it<br>
- continued compressor failures and combustion problems
</p>

<p>
- first H.1 E.6/41 flew on 20 Sept 43 with 2225 lb thrust (74% design)<br>
- in July 44, MAP called for an “urgent revision” to the H.1 policy, which resulted in a complete redesign of the engine
</p>

<p>
86
</p>

<p>
- 20 Jan 45, a Goblin finally completed a 100 hour service type test at 2700 lb (90%) thrust
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
- both German jet engines (003 and 004) had similar power ratings of about 2000 lb

<p>
The remarkable production of ersatz aero-engines
</p>

<p>
Increasing the ease and reducing the cost of airframe and aero-engine production had been a goal of the RLM since the beginning of the war
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
Jumo and BMW’s turbojet engines could be made using much less material — whether scarce or plentiful metals — than piston engines of a similar power output. The important Daimler-Benz 603 piston engine, for example, produced 1750 horsepower for a dry weight of 2030 pounds; its power to weight ratio was 0.86 hp/lb. The Jumo 004B (the firm’s first production version) in contrast, weighed 1585 pounds (dry) but produced the rough equivalent of 2580 horsepower when flying at 400 mph. Its power to weight ratio at speed was thus about 1.6 hp/lb. 
</p>

<p>
Much is made of the German replacement of strategic metals in their turbojet engines as a virtuoso technical accomplishment (e.g. Constant1980:211), but efforts to reduce the strategic metal content of piston aero-engines were already standard in the first years of the war.
</p>

<p>
104
</p>

<p>
- aero-engine production used abt 130 t of Ni/month at the start of 1940<br>
- in 1942, only around 50 t/month<br>
- despite an increase in overall engine production over the same period
</p>

<p>
- progression to less strategic metals per engine from test to production articles was planned from the start; prototypes used more metals in order to speed up the development<br>
- the crucial point is that the move to turbojets itself saved metal!
</p>

<p>
- also, manhour savings: Jumo 213, DB 603, and BMW801 all took about 3000 man-hours to build
</p>

<p>
105
</p>

<p>
- in UK, careful planning and highly specialised production lines in Manchester allowed Ford to reduce the production time for a Merlin engine from 10000 hours to 2727 hours in three years
</p>

<p>
By the end of the war, the Jumo 004-B-1 (the main production version) required a mere 700 man-hours to build if production was well organized (down from about 980 in May 1943). The RLM required that BMW bring their turbojet production time to 500 hours. This was not an insanely crazy demand, as it would have been for a piston engine, although the BMW engine required closer to 1000 man-hours to make in practice. The firm reduced its engine construction time largely through the substitution of sheet metal parts for parts that required more time for machining or casting, including its air-cooled turbine blades, which were ultimately folded out of sheet metal.
</p>

<p>
- also, jet engines could run on less refined and more plentiful diesel oil
</p>

<p>
107
</p>

<p>
The rising jet engine production figures achieved at the very end of the war, when production across Germany was faltering, were evidence not of German technical superiority but of the turbojet engine’s ability to be mass-produced under conditions of extreme scarcity using brutal labour practices. 
</p>

<p>
109
</p>

<p>
- Germany’s turbojet production implied engineering and produciton choices that the Allies neither had to make nor would have made
</p>

<p>
The German programme ultimately sacrificed future development, performance, quality, and safety for production. 
</p>

<p>
116
</p>

<p>
- precursors of gas turbine components etc. are important to consider; all the key parts of the turbojet engine existed in some form before the war
</p>

<p>
- Bristol’s Chief Engineer, Roy Fedden, had asked the head of Bristol’s project office, Frank Owner, already in 1924 to carry out an investigation of the potential of a turboprop engine as a replacement for piston engines<br>
- Owner dismissed the engine type as much too inefficient<br>
- he later evaluated Whittle’s GT proposal of February 1931, regarding Whittle’s scheme as sound in principle but unlikely to become practical for another decade
</p>

Researchers at the DVL had tried two systems for turbine cooling. The first system provided cooling air through hollow turbine blades - as used by BMW and later Jumo. The second was a system of partial-impingement pioneered by Leist, whereby the turbine blades were<br>
174<br>
only exposed to high-temperature exhaust gases for a fraction of each rotation. When not in the hot gases, the blades were cooled by passing through a stream of cold air.
</p>

<p>
- DB 109-007 used partial impingement cooling, pioneered by Leist<br>
- ducted fan provided a stream of unheated air<br>
- turbine blades exposed to hot gas during 70% of their rotation
</p>

<p>
- Sanford Moss of GE had used cooling in gas turbines; cooled the turbine’s surface
