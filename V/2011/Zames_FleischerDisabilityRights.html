<h2>Chapter Three: Deinstitutionalization and independent living</h2>

<br>

<p>
38
</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li>disability activists learned from women's rights activists; both saw a connection between their experiences</li>
<li>however, not all civil rights activists recognized the connection</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>circular reasoning prevalent:</h3>

<p>
"We secured the first curb cut in the country; it was at the corner of Bancroft and Telegraph Avenue. When we first talked to legislators about the issue, they told us, "Curb cuts, why do you need curb cuts? We never see people with disabilities out on the streets. Who is going to use them?" They didn't realize their reasoning was circular." (27)
</p>

<h3>how to harness anger</h3>

<br>

<p>
Edward Roberts indicates how he harnessed his anger:
</p>

<p>
"Most psychiatrists and service professionals who work with us tell us that anger is a bad thing - a stage to get over or something that we need to overcome. But anger is a powerful energy. We don't need to suppress or get over our anger; we need to channel it into making change for the greater good. We need to make sure that we don't turn our anger in on ourselves or our loved ones, but focus it on removing obstacles and making things happen. ... I get angry all the time. I'm angry that people with disabilities are second-class citizens in this country. I get angry at how 97 percent of the billions of federal dollars spent either perpetuate our dependency on the system or increase it." (29, John Oda, Highlights from Speeches by Ed Roberts (unpublished manuscript), April 1995. Quoted in Zames Fleischer and Zames 2011:40)
</p>

<p>
42
</p>

<p>
"[Ed Roberts] was one of the first people to get the idea that it was not just his job to "deal with" his disability; rather, society had some obligations, too. In the 1960s, the very concept that the University of California at Berkeley and the City of Berkeley had responsibilities to accommodate for Ed's needs and for those of other students like him was radical. Certainly, it never occurred to me in four years of college that Western Maryland College should accomodate my needs [as a deaf student]. I just never thought of it that way. I saw a college that worked the way it worked, and I thought my job was to adjust to that way - or get out. But once someone like Ed introduces a new way of thinking, it can spread - as it did! I was one of many who benefited." (Dr. Frank Bowe, professor at Hofstra University. p. 42)
</p>

<h3>independent living founded by privileged white students</h3>

<br>

<p>
the founders of Independent Living movement "were bright white male students of a prestigious university who grew up in homes where families could describe themselves as "comfortable." In the ´40s and ´50s, polio had knocked down those families´ most-likely-to-succeed kids like bowling pins. America's best and brightest ... had been transformed over night into second-class citizens by a microscopic organism with a long Latin name..."
</p>

<p>
"What caused them to question their second-class status? They'd hatched out of privilege and protection into a world that was changing radically. A people's cry for liberty and justice was visible, audible, and haunting America on its nightly news." ...
</p>

<p>
"The independent living movement arose from among privileged white boys."
</p>

<p>
46
</p>

<h3>mental models differ between rehabilitation and independent living approahces</h3>

<p>
<ul>
<li>the difference between the rehabilitation and independent living approaches to disability:</li>
</ul>
  - rehabilitation model locates the problem in the person with the disability, emphasizing fixing the individual<br>
  - independent living paradigm places the problem in the attitudes of society and stresses changing the environment<br>
  - language of rehabilitation: "patient," "client", connoting dependence on authority<br>
  - vocabulary of independent living: "consumer", suggesting control by the user of the service.<br>
- the objective of the independent living construct is to fully integrate the person with the disability fully into the social, economic, and political fabric of the community.
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
"Our society [still] puts people like Fred into nursing homes at far more cost than would be required to empower them."
</p>

<p>
48
</p>

<p>
activist Tom Clancy:
</p>

<p>
Look out America, because I'm coming. I have always had my dream and my rainbow, but now the picture is clearer and the colors are brighter. I have tried and failed, cried and raged in silence. I have sat and watched because I could not keep in step with you, but I never gave up.
</p>

<p>
You have not heard the last of me. In fact, you have not heard me at all. Until recent times, you kept me out of sight and sound. Now as you begin the search for a moral answer to the materialistic chaos which you now have created, my voice will rise. For I am the living proof that physical and mental perfection are not the answer. It is the inner fire that will not accept the "impossible."
</p>

<p>
Move over Aquarius! There is a new dawn coming. (38)

<h2>Chapter Four: Groundbreaking Disability Rights Legislation: Section 504</h2>

<br>

<p>
50
</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li>James L. Cherry, a disabled white activist, recognized in 1968 the connection betwee social accommodation denied because of race and physical accommodation denied because of disability</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
55
</p>

<p>
...responses reveal commonly assumed, patronizing attitudes towards people with disabilities. Adults with disabilities were treated as if they were "medical models," unable to make reasoned decisions about their capabilities, or as if they were hysterical children to be placated.
</p>

<p>
Martin Luther King's advisor said:"People think that revolutions begin with injustices. They don't. A revolution begins with hope."

<h3>transbus lawsuit</h3>

<p>
<ul>
<li>Transbus lawsuit: a technologically feasible accessible design was available but not produced</li>
<li>A device that all can use is more likely to be properly maintained than one used only by a particular population - hence Transbus was preferred over GM's solution where those who could not negotiate stairs had a separate entrance</li>
<li>Not at all surprisingly, the American Public Transit Association, which included General Motors, voted in 1978 to defer the development of Transbus</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>

</p>

<h3>accessible bus programs in Seattle and St. Louis in the 1980s</h3>

<br>

<p>
Yet the mindset of most directors of transit agencies was revealed by their response to constrasting 1980s accessible bus programs, one in Seattle, the other in St. Louis. Since the Seattle lift-equipped buses, besides being safe and reliable, arrived at reasonable and predictable intervals, they enjoyed comparatively high ridership by wheelchair users. On the other hand, wheelchair users, having no confidence in the poorly managed and therefore unreliable St. Louis lift-bus system, did not ride the buses. Cannon observes, "To prove their preconceived notion that wheelchair users would not ride buses in significant numbers, many transit agency 'experts' generalized the St. Louis experience, while labelling the Seattle program an anomaly. thus, they reversed the adage, 'Success has many fathers; failure is an orphan'." (26)
</p>

<p>
60
</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li>similar approach in New York, where the MTA created a self-fulfilling prophecy when it claimed that the accessible buses were not needed since few people made use of them.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
69
</p>

<h3>The civil rights significance of accessible transportation</h3>

<br>

<p>
<ul>
<li>Dennis Cannon, a public transport authority, offered in 1980 a testimony before the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights:</li>
<li>considered the connection between the integration of people of color and the integration of people with disabilities</li>
<li>physical barriers are a civil rights issue</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Barriers to the participation of black people in society are primarily institutional, educational, and economic. Barriers to the participation of disabled people in society include all of these, plus the addtional barriers presented by the physical environment. Because physical barriers appear to be a "natural" part of the environment rather than existing because of overt oppression, and because removing them is perceived as costly, opponents have tended to focus on ... barrier removal as the excuse for maintaining the institutional, [educational], and economic barriers.
</p>

<p>
[But] I maintain that the _only_ barrier is an attitudinal barrier. If there were no additudinal barriers, when we perceive a problem such as transportation, the two parties would sit down and work out a simple engineering solution. The fact that does not occur even when there is, indeed, a simple engineering solution available is due to the attitudinal barrier, not to the physical barrier.
</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li>of course, transport has additional significance to civil rights due ton Rosa Parks</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>Chapter Five: The Struggle for Change: In the Streets and in the courts</h2>

<br>

<h3>Struggles in the street and in the courts, like civil rights movement</h3>

<br>

<p>
72
</p>

<h3>Civil rights orgs did not see there could be a court case</h3>

<br>

<p>
Judith E. Heumann recalls after not getting a teaching job:
</p>

<p>
The ACLU said there was no reason for me to come down for an interview because it was not a case of discrimination that they felt they could win in court. It was purely a medical decision, and no judge was going to rule in my favor on an issue like that.
</p>

<h3>connection to poverty being an economic issue</h3>

<br>

<p>
<ul>
<li>the Board of Education's logic that appeared irrefutable was that leading pupils out of a building in case of fire was part of a teacher's job description</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
102
</p>

<h3>US courts accepted argument that substantial limits to a major life activity like reproduction constitute a disability in the sense of ADA</h3>

<br>

<p>
<ul>
<li>lower courts had been split on the applicability of ADA to invisible disabilities like HIV</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
104
</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li>a civil rights act that _only_ covered African-Americans but not Hispanics for instance would be a travesty; similarly disability can cover those conditions not originally intended</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
105
</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li>disabled community may not have considered nearsighted pilots as "disabled" and may have felt annoyed when those who are not "truly disabled" try to reap the fruits of disabled activists' hard work</li>
<li>many disability rights critics assume a clear adversarial relationship between disabled and nondisabled people, e.g. Philip K. Howard in The Death of Common Sense, "The disabled lobby is waging war against every other citizen".</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>The myth of the "disability lobby"</h3>

<br>

<p>
Apparently, the author has not accepted disability as a universal possibility, or even probability, for most of humankind. Furthermore, he ignores the great number of nondisabled people intimately connected with loved ones with disabilities, for whom they care and advocate.
</p>

<p>
106
</p>

<h3>All movements that allow a formerly powerless people to determine their own destiny engender hostility in individuals comfortable with the status quo.</h3>

<p>
Dart explains, "Many of these journalists and media personalities antagonistic to the ADA expect oppressed people to stay in their place."
</p>

<p>
107
</p>

<h3>Too often only visible disabilities are considered legitimate</h3>

<h3>The Eugenics Movement and euthanasia</h3>

<br>

<p>
<ul>
<li>Martin S. Pernick documented the sensational story of Dr Harry Haiselden, known in 1916 as well to Americans as Dr. Kevorkian later</li>
<li>Haiselden allowed a newborn baby with an impairment to die in 1915</li>
<li>expressed, in effect, hatred, fear and loathing for those born with disabilities</li>
<li>disabled were going to devour society</li>
<li>Pernick reveals why Haiselden was so accepted:</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>the common progressive belief was that science provided objective means for distinguishing good lives from bad ones</h3>

<p>
<ul>
<li>this hid the subjectivity of values people actually used to make such judgements</li>
<li>because the people believed their values to be objectively proven, they could dismiss ethical or political criticism as biased, unscientific, and therefore irrelevant (41)</li>
<li>In 1923, a German physician-geneticist Fritz Lenz complained that "Germany had nothing to match the eugenics research institutions in England and the United States"</li>
</ul>
  - Lenz rebuked the German people because of "their backwardness in the domain of sterilization as compared to the United States [for] Germany had no equivalent to the american laws prohibiting marriage ... for people suffering from such conditions as epilepsy or mental retardation."
