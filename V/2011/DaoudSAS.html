</p>

<p>
The purpose of this thesis is to study the nature of scarcity, abundance, and sufficiency (SAS).
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
- at least 2 excellent reviews of the literature on SAS, especially of the classics and their authors' views on the issue - Hume, Smith, Marx, Mill etc.<br>
- Hegeland (1967)<br>
- Xenos (1989)<br>
- they give a general picture of how SAS has been conceptualized in social and economic theory
</p>

<p>
- eight problems originating from different fields are discussed (although only one is studied in depth):<br>
<ol type="1" start="1">
<li>The effects of SAS - related to various disciplines of the social sciences</li>
<li>The problem of allocation - related to neoclassical economics</li>
<li>The universalization of scarcity</li>
<li>The limits to growth</li>
<li>The assemblage of resources - all these relate to heterodox economics or an internal critique of neoclassical economics</li>
<li>The problem of foundations of the social sciences</li>
<li>The origins of human wants</li>
<li>The nature of SAS - these relate to sociology or an external critique of neoclassical economics</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
- this thesis studies in depth the nature of SAS

<p>
Problem 1: The effects of SAS
</p>

<p>
Various socioeconomic phenomena seem to presuppose, hinge on or arise as a causal effect of SAS. Some central examples are<br>
- Market (Menger 2004)<br>
- Private property (Tchipev 2006)<br>
- Justice (Hume 1896:494-5)<br>
- Public good (Héritier 2001; Sandler 2001:165)<br>
- Poverty (cf. Clark 2002)<br>
- Power (Cook, Cheshire and Gerbasi 2006)<br>
- Action (Balla 1982)<br>
- Liberalism (Macpherson 1973; Wolin 2004; Xenos 1987)<br>
- Time (Burenstam Linder 1970; Gordon 1980)<br>
- Citizenship (Turner 1999:262ff)<br>
- History itself (Sartre 1991)
</p>

<p>
Problem 2: Efficient allocation
</p>

<p>
The existence of scarcity has been taken as the central point of departure for neoclassical economics since the establishment of the marginalist revolution in the late nineteenth century, which in a sense also marks the beginning of the end of classical political economy (Sandelin, Trautwein and Wundrak 2001, p. 132; Schabas 2001; Tribe 2001). All three pioneers of marginal utility theory – Walras, Jevons, and Menger – referred to scarcity as the starting point for economic analysis (Jevons 1888, p. 37; Menger 2004, p. 94; Walras 1954, p. 65). Through the work of these pioneers, especially Menger’s marginal<br>
utility theory, the centrality of scarcity became an important theoretical premise for the advancement of contemporary neoclassical economics (Hayek 1994, p. 18; Robbins 1998, p. 277; Roll 1973, p. 387).
</p>

<p>
- six basic ontological premises in NC econ:<br>
- economics is said to be about scarcity or management of scarce resources<br>
14<br>
- scarcity is believed to be general<br>
- universal scarcity arises because we have unlimited wants and limited resources<br>
- because resources are limited and our wants are virtually unlimited, all ends are seen as competing ends; i.e. there are trade-offs or alternative uses<br>
15<br>
- choice confronts any individual, organization, or human endeavour<br>
- by positioning scarcity as the general or universal point of departure for economics, the existence of abundance (and sufficiency) is placed outside the set of possible objects to study, at least implicitly
</p>

<p>
16
</p>

<p>
In a general economic approach to social behavior, that is rational choice theory, constraints can be anything that restricts the choice opportunities of an individual. <br>
16<br>
Constraints are not only economical in nature (e.g. income), but can also be social (e.g. norms) (Becker and Murphy 2000) or psychological (e.g. self-bounding) (Elster 2000). These kinds of social or psychological constraint, however, are not necessarily solely a matter of scarcity of resources. It seems that all scarcities are about constraints in the perspective of economic theory, but not all constraints are about scarcity in a general social scientific perspective. Scarcity is a specific kind of constraint in so far as it refers to the set of means or resources that can be directly used to satisfy a set of wants or needs (Menger 2004, p. 77 ff).
</p>

<br>
<br>

<p>
21
</p>

<p>
...one of the major problems of the neoclassical approach is that it reduces the general study of socioeconomic affairs to being mainly about the problem of efficient allocation under conditions of scarcity (cf. Beckert 2002; Bourdieu 2005; Etzioni 1988; Lawson 1997; Polanyi 1977). For example, it usually does not account for how various constraints and preferences, and so scarcity, arise in the first place...
</p>

<p>
22
</p>

<p>
Problem 3: The universalization of scarcity
</p>

<p>
- a vibrant tradition of heterodox economists (Davis 2008; Lee 2008) have criticized the assumption of and the exaggerated focus on scarcity in neoclassical economics, i.e.<br>
- the problem of the universalization of scarcity<br>
- this also implies that the problem of abundance and sufficiency is largely neglected<br>
- it is not clear why some non-neoclassical approaches ignore the concepts of abundance and sufficiency<br>
- it is apparent that abundance and sufficiency are important concepts (Dugger and Peach 2009)
</p>

<p>
HOX HOX! Abundance and sufficiency in innovation - product development - R&amp;D - could be that often designers simply satisfice, good enough = sufficient? Scarcity is relative, sometimes (perhaps even often) there is no real trade-offs in important questions
</p>

<p>
23
</p>

<p>
- some social scientists have gone beyond the neoclassical approach and advanced studies of abundance:
</p>

<p>
(e.g., Benammar 2005; Bronfenbrenner 1962; Dugger and Peach 2009; Fricker 1999; Galbraith 1958; Hoeschele 2008; Horner 1997; Sheehan 2010; Sherburne 1972). These studies have focused, among other things, on unemployment, which is seen as abundance of labour power (Dugger and Peach 2009, pp. 41 ff., 173 ff.; Perelman 1979; Perelman 1987), on consumer society with its cornucopia of goods and services (e.g., Xenos 1989), on the possibilities of a post-scarcity society as well as on emancipator reasoning (Bataille 1991; Bookchin 1971; Giddens 1990, p. 164; Gowdy 1998; Sherburne 1972; Stoekl 2007). Most of these accounts rest on the assumption that continuous technological development accompanied by deeper self-awareness of what our actual needs are may enable a society that harbours an abundance of resources. 
</p>

<p>
24
</p>

<p>
Problem 4: The limits to growth
</p>

<p>
26
</p>

<p>
Problem 5: The assemblage of resources
</p>

<p>
- what is a resource anyway? <br>
- a precise definition is discussed in paper 1<br>
27<br>
- a study of the concept of resources is often neglected and assumed that only natural scientists can provide an appropriate answer
</p>

<p>
But, as shown via the problem of the limits to growth, there are social as well as cultural processes that condition how resources are created and defined (cf. Hacking 1999; Pinch and Swedberg 2008)
</p>

<p>
HOX HOX! Social and cultural processes in creation and definition of constraints
</p>

<p>
What is a resource, and how is it related to technology?
</p>

<p>
30
</p>

<p>
Problem 7: The origins of human wants
</p>

<p>
- three possible reasons for scarcity:<br>
<ol type="1" start="1">
<li>Nature is niggardly; there is simply too few resources available</li>
<li>Human beings have infinite wants - this is partly based on reading e.g. Durkheim, Hobbes, Marshall and Freud</li>
<li>Scarcity exists because of the social plasticity of wants (cf. Veblen 2007; Xenos 1989)</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
The difference between the second and third explanation is that, in the former, human beings are seen to be, by their very nature, equipped with infinite wants or desires (which are tamed by culture, cf. Freud), whereas the latter assumes that it is society that plants infinite wants in the minds of individuals<br>
- nevertheless of the root cause, the result is similar<br>
- many sociologists such as Parsons probably think of the cause 2<br>
- culture as restraint or as a cause of wants?
</p>

<p>
31
</p>

<p>
Irrespective of how one conceptualizes the human being and her wants ..., it seems to me that scarcity as a concept depends on the existence of some sort of want, lack or craving (cf. Heller 1976; Peterson 2001; Springborg 1981; Townsend 1985).
</p>

<p>
32
</p>

<p>
Problem 8: The nature of SAS
</p>

<p>
- example of how important social theorists define their subject matter with reference to scarcity, but without really questioning the relevance of the concept of scarcity<br>
- Polanyi is an exception to this<br>
- Weber (1949:63-4) defines socioeconomics as consisting of three closely interrelated disciplines: economic theory, economic sociology and economic history:
</p>

<p>
Most roughly expressed, the basic element in all those phenomena... is constituted by the fact that our physical existence and the satisfaction of our most ideal needs are everywhere confronted with the quantitative limits and the qualitative inadequacy of the necessary external means, so that their satisfaction requires planful provision and work, struggel with nature and the association of human beings.
</p>

<p>
- Weber claims that needs, desires or individuals' interests are not given; they are conditioned by subjective factors and related to the cognitive and cultural environment of specific societies. <br>
- Weber (1949:64): "By a social science problem we mean a task for a discipline the object of which is to throw light on the ramifications of that fundamental social-economic phenomenon: the scarcity of means."<br>
- i.e. understanding and explaining scarcity is one of the central tasks of social science
</p>

<p>
- the thesis argues that scarcity should be defined better
</p>

<p>
37
</p>

<p>
- the specific research questions:<br>
a) Are there different kinds of scarcity, abundance, and sufficiency? - see papers 1, 3 and 5<br>
b) How could scarcity, abundance, and sufficiency be properly explained in relation to real events? - see papers 1, 3 and 2<br>
c) How could a sociological theory of want formation be developed? - see papers 3 and 4
</p>

<p>
41
</p>

<p>
- are there different kinds of scarcity?<br>
- Yes, most importantly there are absolute and relative scarcities (Baumgartner et al., 2006; Raiklin and Uyar 1996)<br>
- these seem to refer not only to different objects (physical vs. social), different states (post-scarcity), or different spatial positionings of resources (extrinsic vs. intrinsic), but actually to different kinds of scarcities.

According to both Raiklin and Uyar (1996) and Baumgartner et al. (2006), the needs-wants distinction is an important element of the definitions of absolute and relative scarcity. Baumgartner et al. added substitutability of resources as well. That is, if a resource can be substituted or allocated differently, then we can talk about relative scarcity; if not, then we have a case of absolute scarcity (Baumgartner et al. 2006:490). <br>
- both accounts claim that it's relative scarcity that is the focus of neoclassical economics, not absolute scarcity<br>
- the distinction between relative and absolute scarcity does not seem to be widely utilized

<p>
HOX HOX! Relative vs. absolute constraints - relative constraints if it can be solved with trade-offs???

People are, for some reason ... not given access to available [resources]; they are not entitled to such access. This is the definition of a situation of quasi-scarcity (viz. enough [resources] on the systemic level, but invalid entitlements on the individual level) - that is, it looks like scarcity of [resource], but it is not. This reasoning is adopted from Amaryta Sen's entitlement approach.<br>
- see Sen (1981)<br>
- paper 1's HASAS model asks why scarcity arises in the first place
