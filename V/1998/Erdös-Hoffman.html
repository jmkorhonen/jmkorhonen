...lived from a shabby suitcase and a drab orange plastic bag from Centrum Aruhaz ("Central Warehouse"), a large department store in Budapest.<br>
...<br>
His modus operandi was to show up on the doorstep of a fellow mathematician, declare, "My brain is open," work with his host for a day or two, until he was bored or his host was run down, and then move on to another home.<br>
Erdös's motto was not "Other cities, other maides" but "Another roof, another proof." He did mathematics in more than twenty-five different countries, completing important proofs in remote places and sometimes publishing them in equally obscure journals. 
</p>

<p>
7
</p>

<p>
...for the last twenty-five years of his life, since the death of his mother, he put in nineteen-hour days, keeping himself fortified with 10 to 20 milligrams of Benzedrine or Ritalin, strong espresso, and caffeine tablets. "A mathematician," Erdös was fond of saying, "is a machine for turning coffee into theorems." When friends urged him to slow down, he always had the same response: "There'll be plenty of time to rest in the grave."
</p>

<p>
8
</p>

<p>
He usually wore a gray pin-striped jacket, dark trousers, a red or mustard shirt or pajama top, and sandals or peculiar pockmarked Hungarian leather shoes, made especially for his flat feet and weak tendons. His whole wardrobe fit into one small suitcase, with plenty of room left for his dinosaur of a radio. He had so few clothes that his hosts found themselves washing his socks and underwear several times a week. 
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
"Some French socialist said that private property was theft," Erdös recalled. "I say that private property is a nuisance."
</p>

<p>
The only possessions that mattered to him were his mathematical notebooks. He filled ten of them by the time he died. He always carried one around with him, so that he could record his mathematical thoughts on a moment's notice. 
</p>

<p>
- Erdös was always kind and compassionate:<br>
"He existed on a web of trust," said Aaron Meyerowitz, a mathematician at Florida Atlantic University. "When I was a graduate student and we had never met before, I gave him a ride. I didn't know the route and asked him if he wanted to navigate with a map. He didn't want to<br>
10<br>
 [and probably didn't know how to]. He just trusted that I, a total stranger, would get him there." 
</p>

<p>
 What little money Erdös received in stipends or lecture fees he gave away to relatives, colleagues, students and strangers. He could not pass a homeless person without giving him money. "In the early 1960s, when I was a student at University College London," recalled D.G. Larman, "Erdös came to visit us for a year. After collecting his first month's salary he was accosted by a beggar on Euston station, asking for the price of a cup of tea. Erdös removed a small amount from the pay packet to cover his own frugal needs and gave the remainder to the beggar."
</p>

<p>
 - in 1984, won Wolf price and $50 000; contributed most to a scholarship in Israel he established in the name of his parents; kept $750 and someone commented that for him, that was a lot of money to keep
</p>

<p>
15
</p>

<p>
- outside mathematics, Erdös was almost helpless<br>
- after his mother's death, Ronald Graham at AT&amp;T Bell Labs "looked after him," spending almost as much time handling his affairs in the 1980s as he did overseeing 70 scientists at AT&amp;T<br>
- Graham managed Erdös's money, which dribbled from multiple places and in multiple currencies<br>
16<br>
- he also had a closet full of filing cabinets containing copeis of more than a thousand of Erdös's articles<br>
- Graham kept his papers and sent them to one person or another at Erdös's request<br>
- Graham sent out 1500 letters a year, mostly dealing with mathematics
</p>

</p>

<p>
Cooking skills: nonexistent.
</p>

<p>
In fact, he never cooked anything at all, or even boiled water for tea. "I can make excellent cold cereal, " he said, "and I could probably boil an egg, but I've never tried." He was twenty-one when he buttered his first piece of bread, his mother or a domestic servant having always done it for him. "I remember clearly," he said. "I had just gone to England to study. It was teatime, and<br>
22<br>
bread was served. I was too embarassed to admit that I had never buttered it. I tried. It wasn't so hard." Only ten years before, at the age of eleven, he had tied his shoes for the first time. 
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
In 1934 ... Erdös left Hungary for political reasons. ... He went to England for a four-year postdoctoral fellowship at Manchester, where the wanderlust that would characterize his adult life was first evident. "From 1934 he hardly ever slept in the same bed for seven consecutive nights," wrote Erdös's collaborator Béla Bollabás, "frequently leaving Manchester for Cambridge, London, Bristol, and other universities. 
</p>

<p>
- had wanted to go to Germany but the rise of Fascism prevented him
</p>

<p>
127
</p>

<p>
- returned to Budapest in 2 Dec 1948, after a decade abroad<br>
- left soon, after communists started to close borders and put people on show trials
</p>

<p>
128
</p>

<p>
- Feb 1949: ships out from Hungary. For next three years, went back and forth between England and US <br>
- landed a flexible deal with U Notre Dame in 1952: had to teach only one class and had an assistant who could take over on a spur of a moment should he have the urge to rush off and finish a proof with a collaborator<br>
- Notre Dame offered to make the appointment permanent under same terms<br>
- Erdös turned it down, because he didn't want to be pinned dwn by the responsibilities of a permanent job<br>
- felt strongly about aging, complaining that "death begins at forty"<br>
- in 1954, was invited to an international mathematics conference in Amsterdam <br>
129<br>
- US denied a re-entry visa<br>
130<br>
- Holland would give a visa only for couple of months<br>
- England no better; did not like his work with Red Chinese mathematician<br>
- at last, Israel bailed him out with a 3-month appointment at Hebrew University<br>
- became resident of Israel, but not citizen: kept his Hungarian passport and declared himself a citizen of the world<br>
131<br>
- visited Hungary in 1955 when well-connected friends argued that Erdös was a singular asset to the world culture of mathematics and convinced the Hungarian government to grant him a special passport that said he was a Hungarian citizen but acknowledged his Israeli residency<br>
- this special passport was granted only to Erdös<br>
- the new Hungarian dictator, János Kádár, reaffirmed the passport
</p>

<p>
132
</p>

<p>
- went to the US after getting a visa to visit a conference in Colorado
</p>

<p>
136
</p>

<p>
- Erdös forged a special bond with anyone he perceived as vulnerable<br>
- in 1945, a party was arranged by a mathematician who was eager to see Erdös<br>
- only when everyone was ready to leave, did they learn that Erdös had found out that the host had a blind father, who could not join the party, but sat up in a room on the upper floor; preferred to spend time with the lonely blind man rather than with people who were eager to meet him<br>
- one student in Emory was bound to a wheelchair with cerebral palsy; when Erdös came over and saw him, he immediately asked what his disease was and what was his prognosis; found out more about the student in ten minutes than professors had learned in the entire time he was a graduate student in the department
</p>

<p>
137
</p>

<p>
- petitioned the US government repeatedly in the early 1960s to allow him reentry<br>
- during Summer 1963, couple hundred mathematicians signed a petition asking the State Department to readmit him; he was able to return in November<br>
- returned to Budapest at least once a year until 1973, when he was enraged by Kádár's boycott (under Soviet pressure) of Israeli mathematicians from a conference held in Hungary in honor of Erdös's 60th birthday <br>
- went to the conference, but did not return until 1976 when his childhood friend was dying<br>
138<br>
- in 1964, his mother (age 84) started traveling with him<br>
- accompanied to everywhere but India (for fear of diseases) for 7 years
</p>

<p>
 143
</p>

<p>
 - his mother died in 1971 from apparent misdiagnosis<br>
 - afterwards, Erdös began starting a lot of pills, first antidepressants and then amphetamines
</p>

 - Fibonacci's number originally posed as a question about rabbits:<br>
 "A certain man put a pair of rabbits in a place surrounded by a wall. How many pairs of rabbits can be produced from that pair in a year if it is supposed that every month each pair begets a new pair which from the second month on becomes productive?"
</p>

<p>
 - the number of pairs for the seqyence 1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89,144,233,377...<br>
 - each number the sum of two previous numbers<br>
 - the rabbit sequence is simply the simplest of Fibonacci numbers
</p>

</p>

<p>
 Historically, many of the brightest minds in mathematics have prided themselves on doing math that has no applications. Math for math's sake was the rallying cry. 
</p>

<p>
 ...
</p>

<p>
When Euclid was investigating prime numbers, he was proud that they contributed nothing practical to Greek life. G,H, Hardy, too, revelled in his uselessness. "I have never done anything 'useful,'" he once said, not as an apology, but in defiance. "No discovery of mine has made, or is likely to make, directly or indirectly, for good or ill, the least difference to the amenity of the world." Hardy was a committed pacifist, who proudly claimed that his area of expertise, number theory, would never be used by the military.<br>
- but prime numbers are used in codes today
</p>

<p>
- about work by Ron Graham, one of the persons closest to Erdös when he died:
</p>

<p>
Consider the problem of dividing a group of weights into two piles that are as close as possible in total weight. Like the traveling salesman problem, this simply worded problem is immune to fast algorithms, although it turns out to yield to a strategy that finds a good but not the best answer. Consider the simple case of five weights, three of which weight 2 pounds each and two of which weight 3 pounds each. In this simple case it's easy to find the exact answer by inspecting all the possibilities...
</p>

<p>
But increase the number of weights dramatically, and trial and error is out of the question. In those cases, Graham suggests applying the following algorithm: Starting with the heaviest weight and working down to the lightest, put each weight into the pile that tends at each step of the way to keep the weights of the piles as equal as<br>
170<br>
possible.
</p>

<p>
- Graham was able to prove that for two piles and any distribution of weights whatsoever, this easy-to-apply algorithm <br>
171<br>
can never be worse off than 16 percent (of the optimal result)
</p>

<p>
- many forms of problems are known as the bin-packing problem: how to pack a set of items into a set of bins, such as the total weight (or total volume) doesn't exceed some number
</p>

<p>
The lazy way to tackle the bin-packing problem is to take the items in whatever order they come and put each one into the first bin it fits. This first-fit packing algorithm, as it is aptly called, doesn't turn out to be very effective. In 1973, Jeffrey Ullman at Princeton University proved that this algorithm can yield a solution that is off by as much as 70 percent. The algorithm performs the worst when the larger weights happen to be packed last, because new bins will need to be started before earlier bins can be filled up.
</p>

<p>
Experienced suitcase packers know that if the smaller<br>
172<br>
items are saved for the end, they can be placed in the odd gaps in nearly filled luggage. This suggests a smaretr strategy: order the items from heaviest to lightest, before putting each item into the first bin that can accomodate it. Sure enough, this first-fit, heaviest-to-lightest algorithm has been shown never to be off by more than 22 percent. In 1973, David Johnson, a colleague of Graham's at AT&amp;T, succeeded in proving that this strategy cannot be beaten in practice, that no efficient bin-packing strategy can ever be guaranteed to do better than 22 percent. That Johnson's proof took more than seventy-five pages is testimony to how thorny worst-case mathematics can be. 
</p>

<p>
Counterintuitive anomalies aboud in bin packing, thwarting any straightforward approach. Graham gives an example with thirty-three weights:

and bins that have a capacity of 524 pounds. The first-fit, heaviest-to-lighest strategy requirs seven bins, each filled to the 524-pound capacity:
</p>

<p>
Bin #1: 442 46 12 12 12<br>
Bin #2: 252 252 10 10<br>
Bin #3: 252 252 10 10<br>
Bin #4: 252 252 10 10<br>
Bin #5: 252 127 127 9 9<br>
Bin #6: 127 127 127 106 37<br>
Bin #7: 106 106 106 85 84 37
</p>

<p>
173
</p>

<p>
But throw out the 46-pound weight, and the same algorithm demands not seven bins but eight!
</p>

<p>
Bin #1: 442 37 37 (unused capacity: 8)<br>
Bin #2: 252 252 12 (unused capacity: 8) <br>
Bin #3: 252 252 12 (unused capacity: 8) <br>
Bin #4: 252 252 12 (unused capacity: 8) <br>
Bin #5: 252 127 127 10 (unused capacity: 8) <br>
Bin #6: 127 127 127 16 10 10 10 (unused capacity: 7)<br>
Bin #7: 106 106 106 85 84 10 10 9 (unused capacity: 8) <br>
Bin #8: 9 (unused capacity: 515)

To appreciate the paradox, imagine you're Imelda Marcos packing shoes for a weekend away from the palace. You pack the shoes from the largest to the smallest ... and find that seven suitcases are required. On further reflecton, you realize you don't need to take ski boots ... Holy Manila, you find that with one less item you need an additional suitcase, and the shoes, rather than being packed snugly, are rattling around.

- counterintuitive anomalies also arise in 2- and 3-dimensional versions of bin packing
