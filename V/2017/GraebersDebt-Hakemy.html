<p>
David Graeber's Debt: The First 5000 Years
</p>

<p>
Graeber’s main aim is to undermine the dominant narrative, which sees debt as the natural – and broadly healthy – outcome of the development of a modern economic system. He marshals evidence that supports alternative possibilities, and suggests that the phenomenon of debt emerged not as a result of the introduction of money, but at precisely the same time.<br>
 This in turn allows Graeber to argue against the prevailing notion that economy and state are fundamentally separate entities. Rather, he says, “the two were born together and have always been intertwined
</p>

<p>
debt being a means of enforcing elite and state power. For Graeber, this evaluation of the evidence points to a strong potential solution: there should be more readiness to write off debt, and more public involvement in the debate over debt and its moral implications.
</p>

<br>

<p>
Since the time of the influential Scottish economist Adam Smith* (1723–90), economics has been grounded on the idea that human relations are based on exchange: on trading one thing for another. Graeber says this makes it seem “as if our ties to society, even to the 
</p>

<p>
cosmos itself, can be imagined in the same terms as a business deal.”3 One of the central themes in the book is Graeber’s argument that exchange is not the most fundamental thing about humanity.<br>
 Smith, who pioneered economics as a field of study, argued that money was created in ancient times to make barter* more convenient. In a moneyless barter system, something is traded directly for something else, so that two people can do business together only if each has something the other wants. Graeber argues that there is no evidence to show that money was created for this purpose. 
</p>

<p>
Graeber says that “the very principle of exchange emerged largely as an effect of violence,” and that money and markets find their origins “in crime and recompense, war and slavery, honor, debt, and redemption.”5 This is an important secondary theme in Debt.<br>
 At the same time, Graeber uses his background in anthropology, studying human society, beliefs, and practices, to discuss the “moral basis of economic life.”6 He suggests that human beings shift between different types of economic interaction with one another. Of these different types, “exchange,” Graeber argues, usually occurs among strangers.
</p>

<p>
Graeber also describes differences between the market economy and the pre-market economy, which he calls the “human economy.” Human economies are “economic systems primarily concerned not with the creation of wealth, but with the creation, destruction, and rearranging of human beings.”7 In these economies, money is not used to buy things, but rather to maintain relations between people. When states and empires introduced market systems, exchange became the chief form of interaction between people.
</p>

<p>
Graeber believes his arguments will only become more relevant over the coming years: “There is very good reason to believe that, in a generation or so, capitalism itself will no longer exist.
</p>

<p>
What I have been trying to do in this book is not so much propose a vision of what, precisely, the next age will be like, but to throw open perspectives, enlarge our sense of possibilities; to begin to ask what it would mean to start thinking on a breadth and with a grandeur appropriate to the times.
</p>

<p>
the philosopher Aristotle* concluded around 350 b.c.e. that money arose as means to improve the barter system:4 a “placeholder” for goods making barter more convenient for parties without mutually desired goods. The eighteenth-century Scottish thinker Adam Smith* supported this theory in his book The Wealth of Nations (1776), the first work of modern economics.5 In the early twentieth century it was taken up by economists of the Austrian School* (a school of economic thought that focuses on the rationality and actions of individuals as the primary forces in an economy), notably the Austrian economist Carl Menger.*6 
</p>

<p>
Another theory of the history of money was first put forward in the early twentieth century by the German economist Georg Friedrich Knapp,* and came to be known as chartalism.*7 Knapp proposed that money is a “creature of law,”8 a form of credit* that originated with states’ attempts to direct market activity. Chartalism is closely related to the credit theory of money,* pioneered by the British economist Alfred Mitchell-Innes,*9 which considers money a form of credit and debt. Chartalism and the credit theory of money were highly influential10 in developing today’s dominant understanding of an economic system, known as Keynesianism,
</p>

<p>
By disputing what he called the “Myth of Barter,”* David Graeber draws on the work of anthropologists before him. Marcel Mauss,* a nineteenth-century French sociologist considered to be a pioneer in anthropology, proposed in his book The Gift that barter was not a natural or necessary method of exchange in human society.11
</p>

<p>
renowned British anthropologist Caroline Humphrey* wrote: “No example of a barter economy, pure and simple, has ever been described, let alone the emergence from it of money; all available [studies of the world’s peoples] suggests that there never has been such a thing.
</p>

<p>
The British anthropologist Keith Hart* has also contributed much to the field’s scholarship on money. In his 1986 essay “Heads or Tails? Two Sides of the Coin,” Hart argues that money has always been both a commodity* (something that can be traded), and a token of debt. Graeber has stated that Hart’s essay was one of the inspirations for Debt.
</p>

<p>
In Debt: The First 5,000 Years, David Graeber is attempting to answer several questions, some of which are academic and some of which are moral. All of them lead to the core question: “What, in terms of economic life, is a fair way to live?
</p>

<p>
KEY POINTS
</p>

<p>
 Graeber believes we can build an idea of a fairer economic life using anthropological* evidence (evidence drawn from the study of human culture and society) comparing market* societies (defined by the extent to which trade is conducted for private profit) and non-market societies.
</p>

<p>
Contribution in Context<br>
 One of Debt’s unique contributions is that it combines the various traditions in economic anthropology in an effort to disprove the traditional understanding of economics. Graeber pulls together an enormous range of ethnographic* (cultural) studies, physical evidence from earlier societies, and anthropological theory to conclude that money did not originate from barter* (trade without money) and did not arise as a unit of exchange.
</p>

<p>
Graeber also discusses why money really came about, if not for exchange. He then draws moral conclusions from this discussion, arguing that economies have manipulated the concepts of credit and debt by using money to enforce power relationships.
</p>

<p>
Debt addresses three themes that work together to build a clear idea of what debt really is:
</p>

<p>
 The “myth” that exchange is the most important feature of human behavior<br>
 The role of “obligation” in creating moral grounds for economic relations<br>
 The artificiality of financial debt in human history.
</p>

<br>

<p>
 Each of these three themes reveals something important about debt. Graeber says that, within the language of exchange, debt is a transaction that has not yet been completed. He also says, however, that this is not the natural way for human beings to frame their interactions with one another.
</p>

<p>
The second myth is that of “primordial debts,”* meaning debts that have always existed. According to primordial debt theory: “Governments use taxes to create money, and they are able to do so because they have become the guardians of the debt that all citizens have to one another. This debt is the essence of society itself … and money and markets themselves are simply ways of chopping pieces of it up.”3 Like barter, primordial debt suggests
</p>

<p>
Graeber rejects primordial debt as a myth that claims money itself is a tribute to state power. He cites anthropological evidence showing that money not only existed in non-market societies for ritualistic purposes, but that even in market societies the function of money was dictated by both the state and the market.<br>
 The latter point speaks to the third myth––that the market and the state are independent from each other. Graeber argues that, in fact, the two “were born together and have always been intertwined.”4 Money as a unit of account originated in the temple and palace complexes of the world’s earliest urban civilization, Mesopotamia,* more than 3,000 years b.c.e. During the Axial Age* (a period of ancient history characterized by great advances in human philosophical thought, normally
</p>

<p>
aggressive states throughout Eurasia* looking to expand began issuing money in the form of coins to soldiers. The rulers of these states then demanded that citizens pay taxes using the same coins, which forced citizens to sell supplies to soldiers in exchange for the coins to pay taxes. Markets emerged as a result.<br>
 As Graeber puts it, the above three myths
</p>

<p>
second theme describes the differences between exchange-related debt and other obligations. Graeber argues that people organize their sense of obligation in three ways, based on:
</p>

<p>
 Communism* (looking out for one another according to abilities and needs)<br>
 Exchange (impersonally trading things of similar value)<br>
 Hierarchy (interaction between an inferior and superior). People shift between these approaches based on the nature of their relationships,6 and exchange tends to be reserved for strangers.
</p>

<p>
 presents a vast discussion of the history of Eurasia split into four stages:
</p>

<p>
 The Age of the First Agrarian Empires (3500–800 B.C.E.; “agrarian empires” were political bodies with economies founded on agriculture)<br>
 The Axial Age (800 B.C.E.–600 C.E.)<br>
 The Middle Ages (600–1450 C.E.)<br>
 The “Age of the Great Capitalist Empires” (1450 C.E. to the present day).
</p>

<p>
Graeber connects the rise and fall of currency and the rise and fall of slavery throughout human history as an extreme example of the dangers of money and debt.
</p>

<p>
Graeber argues that exchange-related debt is part of a broader system of more personal obligations. By artificially reducing debt to an amount of money and insisting on repayment, the economic system alienates people from each other.<br>
 In Debt, Graeber also argues that the modern economic system centered on debt is actually harmful. This means the book is not just an alternative to mainstream economic history,* but also thoroughly anti-capitalist. This is in line with Graeber’s own politics,* and provides academic justification for his participation in activist movements.
</p>

<p>
The crucial factor … is money’s capacity to turn morality into a matter of impersonal
</p>

<p>
arithmetic––and by doing so, to justify things that would otherwise seem outrageous or obscene.”<br>
 David Graeber, Debt: The First 5,000 Years
</p>

<p>
evidence shows that in the human economy money exists, but that it is not used in routine transactions for goods and services. Rather, it is used in a ritual way in situations dealing with matters of great importance that cannot be calculated. In these pre-market economies, money is a way to “arrange marriages, establish the paternity of children, head off feuds, console mourners at funerals, seek forgiveness in the case of crimes, negotiate treaties—almost anything but trade…”3<br>
 This all changes, however, when people are removed from their familiar realities, usually through violence. As Graeber writes, even in the human economy “humans can become objects of exchange: first, perhaps, women given in marriage; ultimately, slaves captured in war. What all these relations have in common [is] violence.”
</p>

<p>
according to Graeber, that “It is only by the threat of sticks, ropes, spears, and guns that one can tear people out of those endlessly complicated webs of relationships with others … that render them unique, and thus reduce them to something that can be traded.”5<br>
 This is how physical forms of money change from ritual objects into tools for the commodification and exchange of human beings.<br>
 In the human economy, routine interactions with trusted people take the form of communism* or hierarchy. Exchange comes about through violence, or the threat of violence. This can take the mild form of distrust or fear between two people exchanging objects, or the much harsher form of the exchange of people through slavery.
</p>

<p>
When human economies are taken over or changed into commercial economies, violence increases. Graeber gives examples of this point throughout his book:
</p>

<p>
 The violent commodification of people as slaves in pre-market societies<br>
 The introduction of coins to fuel war machines in the Axial Age*<br>
 Today, the forced repossession of homes to make good on bank debts.
</p>

<br>

<p>
 Debt asks the question “What is debt?” Graeber answers in the last paragraph of his book: “A debt is just the perversion of a promise. It is a promise corrupted by both math and violence.
</p>

<p>
Graeber’s discussion of the primordial debt* theory is both his least developed and most overlooked. As the cultural anthropologist Bill Maurer has written, “Everyone is captivated by [Graeber’s] critique of the myth of primitive barter.* Yet it is a puzzle that a core element of his argument––the myth of primordial debt––has been largely overlooked.
</p>

<p>
Graeber writes that “two famous passages in the Brahmanas* insist that we are born as a debt not just to the gods, to be repaid in sacrifice … but also to the Sages … which we must repay through study; to our ancestors, who we must repay by having children; and finally, ‘to men’––apparently meaning humanity as a whole, to be repaid by offering hospitality to strangers.”8 Primordial debt theorists say these ideas “are not peculiar to a certain intellectual tradition [but are] essential to the very nature and history of human thought.”
</p>

<p>
As Graeber says, by thinking about how to repay an “infinite debt” we are saddled with at birth, “the Brahmanas are offering a quite sophisticated reflection on a moral question that no one has really ever been able to answer any better before or since.
</p>

<p>
Graeber says he rejects the primordial debt myth, his own alternative philosophy can be read as supporting it: “If one were looking for the ethos for an individualistic society such as our own, one way to do it might well be to say: we all owe an infinite debt to humanity, society, nature, or the cosmos … but no one could possibly tell us how we are to pay it … Human freedom would then be our ability to decide for ourselves how we want to do so.”
</p>

<p>
Graeber reasons through two types of discussion:
</p>

<p>
 Using direct evidence from human history to challenge the common understanding of economics<br>
 Discussing moral issues in a Socratic* manner (that is, through posing and answering questions in a manner associated with the ancient Greek philosopher Socrates
</p>

<p>
The disorganization of the book makes it hard to grasp Graeber’s central point––that under capitalism,* debt is a perversion of social obligations used to justify
</p>

<p>
Debt was an international bestseller in the year after its publication (2011).2 So far, no one has challenged the factuality of the historical and anthropological evidence Graber presents, even while debating the conclusions he draws from that evidence.
</p>

<p>
Graeber’s overall scholarship focuses on the more radical topics of economic anthropology,* including equality, power dynamics, and revolution.*<br>
 Debt is an extension of Graeber’s previous work on anthropological theories of value,
</p>

<p>
he questions the ability of the capitalist* system to accurately value the contributions of human beings to one another.<br>
 The anti-capitalist nature of Debt supports Graeber’s reputation as a rebel and lends intellectual strength to his political leanings as an anarchist.
</p>

<br>

<p>
 In many ways Debt is a logical extension of Toward an Anthropological Theory of Value. Debt uses one of Toward’s core arguments—the inability of the capitalist market* to accurately value human actions—as an intellectual backdrop. To underwrite his analysis of debt, Graeber musters a great deal of evidence from his previous works in anthropology and his own research.
</p>

<p>
One of Debt’s major themes is the argument that the capitalist system uses debt as a mechanism to perpetuate inequality and abuse. This is rooted in Graeber’s doctoral fieldwork on the island of Madagascar, where he witnessed first hand the negative effects of large amounts of government debt on economy and people. Pressure to repay the national debt served as both moral and practical justification for cutting social welfare programs and harming quality of life. 
</p>

<p>
The most direct influence on Debt from within Graeber’s own body of work, however, comes from Toward an Anthropological Theory of Value, Graeber’s first book, which established him as an anthropologist concerned with the issues of economic theory. The book’s basic position is that people and, by extension, their actions are the most important “products” of a society.2 The implication is that the notion that values can be established through market exchange is simply wrong: the basis for Graeber’s exploration of debt and human economies in Debt.
</p>

<p>
The principal criticisms made of Debt are that David Graeber has not adequately understood the internal debates among economists, that he attaches too much importance to the origins of economic ideas as a measure of their value, and that his recommendation for debt relief is impractical.
</p>

<p>
Graeber’s main response to arguments like those of Noah Smith that debt relief makes lenders unwilling to lend is that this has been disproven. As Graeber points out, history has had many instances of debt relief, and the practice of lending continues. Furthermore, “big players” (that is, the wealthy or giant corporations) forgive and restructure* one another’s debts frequently.
</p>

<p>
Graeber and his critics argue primarily over petty scholarly points. The book was published so recently that there has not yet been time for a book or an academic work of equal academic weight to offer an opposing school of thought. The debate is largely confined to the Internet.<br>
 In the left-wing quarterly Jacobin magazine, Mike Beggs wrote that Debt is “another move in an interdisciplinary* struggle: anthropology against economics.”5 This is an accurate description, as a gulf has existed between the conclusions of anthropology and economics for approximately a century. However, there is a clear space for cooperation between Graeber’s camp and economists outside the mainstream.
</p>

<p>
The Evolving Debate
</p>

<br>

<p>
 KEY POINTS
</p>

<p>
 As a book written for a popular audience, Debt is positioned as a key influence in shaping the layman’s views on economics* and the current difficulties of the global economic system.<br>
 Although unique in its approach, Debt is one of a number of books in an emerging literature and school of thought highlighting the tendency of capitalism* toward inequality.
</p>

<br>

<p>
 In 2015, Piketty appeared to acknowledge Graeber’s analysis when he called for an international conference on debt and the implementation of a new strategy for dealing with the European debt crisis:* “Essentially, it consists of three components: inflation,* a special tax on private wealth, and debt relief.
</p>

<p>
In Capital, Piketty supports Graeber’s idea that capitalism is a system that, in its purest form, cannot help but create injustice: “Capitalism does not contain an inherent tendency to civilize itself. Left to its own devices, it can be expected to create rates of return on investment so much higher than overall rates of economic growth that the only possible result will be to transfer more and more wealth into the hands of a hereditary elite of investors, to the comparative impoverishment of everybody else.
</p>

<p>
Graeber’s criticism of Piketty is that he “has nothing against capitalism itself … He just wishes to provide a check on capitalism’s tendency to create a useless class of parasitical rentiers* [people who live off the profits from investments].” Graeber concludes that total debt relief and an “unplugging” of the capitalist system is in order.7<br>
 Piketty’s response has been that Graeber’s solution—to put the burden on creditors—is unjust. “The fact is, as I say, that the last creditors are not necessarily the ones who should be made to pay,” Piketty has argued. Rather, a progressive tax* should be imposed on wealth, which, according to Piketty, “seems … a more civilized way to arrive at the same result.

</p>

<p>
Debt’s central lesson is that the traditional understanding of economics and economic history has hidden the real story of capitalism, which is that money and debt allow the powerful to take advantage of the weak.
</p>

<p>
Graeber describes money as the tool used to calculate debts and justify punishments for those who owed them. With five millennia of history as evidence, Graeber argues that the commercial economy does not reflect human nature, and that it creates complex ways for the wealthy to take advantage of the poor. His book declares that capitalism itself is far from the fair and equitable system many imagine,
