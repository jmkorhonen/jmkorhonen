<p>
We defined resilience as a capacity to undergo deep change without or prior to a crisis. (104)
</p>

<p>
- resilience gap: defined as the world becoming turbulent faster than organizations are becoming resilient. (111)
</p>

<p>
The very word resilience originates in part from ecological studies that measure it by assessing the disturbance that a system (in this case a particular natural environment) can absorb before it undergoes a major transformation (Hollnagel &amp; Woods 2006, in Hollnagel, Woods &amp; Levenson 2006). (151)
</p>

<p>
When the ecologists talk about "resilience," they mean the ability of a system to resist major change (or, to endure perturbances without systemic change). (163)<br>
When Gary Hamel and I wrote about resilience in 2003 in the corporate context, we assumed that change is necessary and that, rather than focus on resistance, it would be best to focus on cost: how to effect change as cheaply, or as free of trauma, as possible. Figure 1.1 presents this simple framework: any change can be evaluated relative to its cost. (166)
</p>

<p>
...incumbent corporations have found it phenomenally difficult to accomplish change absent a forcing function such as a financial crisis (Hamel &amp; Välikangas 2003). (184)
</p>

<p>
The engine cannot be changed in midflight. The whole flight plan must be canceled before serious change becomes possible. (188)
</p>

<p>
I suggest we accept the difficulty of transition and acknowledge its typically delayed nature despite calls for creative destruction (how to cannibalize your business now), strategic innovation (compete for the future), or the innovator's solution (which stems from the innovator's paradox - doing well for today makes it difficult to adjust to the future). (193)
</p>

<p>
Niccolò Machiavelli (1469-1527) already noted that "the benefits to the innovator are uncertain but the costs to those affected by the changes involved are not." (196) <a href="..\..\INDEX\TECHNOLOGY.html" title="index:TECHNOLOGY" class="page">index:TECHNOLOGY</a> <a href="./PPL/Machiavelli_Niccolò/Machiavelli-innovation.html" title="PPL:Machiavelli Niccolò:Machiavelli-innovation" class="page">PPL:Machiavelli Niccolò:Machiavelli-innovation</a>
</p>

<p>
While most authors and executives are busy trying to hit upon a strategy for success and then forging its perpetuation, I propose that a more reasonable preoccupation would be building corporate resilience amid times of extreme uncertainty, especially when you consider the poor record of strategies actually delivering their (full) promise (see, for example, "Pop! Went the Profit Bubble," Fortune, May 4, 2009; Also Campbell-Hunt, 2000). (204)
</p>

<p>
...the record of success through strategy excellence leaves enough failures to suggest that wise and responsible corporate leadership should not focus on strategy formulation and implementation alone (for example, Witteloostuijn 1998). (217)
</p>

<p>
Resilience provides the capacity to sustain strategy change. It is the strength an organization draws on in the in-between state, when the old strategy is not really working and the new one is still being developed. What we need to realize is that this in-between-strategies state is now the dominant mode in most companies! (220)
</p>

<p>
Second, a lot of strategy literature suggests that great companies fail not because of something they don't do but because of something they do too much; they cannot stop. (229)
</p>

<p>
...the so-called Icarus Paradox identified by Danny Miller (1990). Resilience - in this sense, tenacity - may help a company to survive far beyond when its strategy has lost all vitality. (237)
</p>

<p>
Companies like Microsoft may be "permanently failing" for a long time before they go bankrupt (Meyer and Zucker 1989). The hard question is - as Jim Collins poses in his book How the Mighty Fall:  how would we know (or rather, be convinced) we are failing when our performance is still technically acceptable? (240)
</p>

<p>
Nassim Nicholas Taleb (2007:xx) persuades us forcefully that we do not even know that we do not know (or conversely, what we know does not really help us much): "The inability to predict outliers implies the inability to predict the course of history... What is surprising is not the magnitude of our forecast errors, but our absence of awareness of it" (italics added). In part, the knowledge we have (provided that others know we have it) prevents such outlier events from happening, at least if they are human intended. (252)
</p>

<p>
Strategy has been the bulwark against uncertainty, on one hand, and the magic wand for success on the other (Think of "blue ocean strategies" by Kim and Mauborgne (2005), for example, where the focus is on the discovery of the heretofore "uncompeted" business arenas.) Perhaps only the word innovation is more reliable than strategy for lifting spirits toward victory. Yet strategy has diminished in stature due to its proven inability to cope with fundamental shifts in the business environment. "No visibility" was the expression used by the CEO John Chambers of Cisco Systems in the dot-com bust of the 2000. "Impossible to call" say many more executives in 2009, though the Nokia CEO Olli-Pekka Kallasvuo claimed "the freefall" had ended in late spring 2009. Indeed, even in the best times, the role of strategy is unclear: "The market was growing so fast there was no need for strategy" was one executive's explanation of his company's process in the late 1990s. Just crank those phones out, efficiently and reliably. No wonder Nokia's strongest suit is logistics (Arlbjorn et al., 2008). (277)
</p>

<p>
...ambiguity is both the demise and the promise of strategy. (289)
</p>

<p>
...resilience does not spring solely from a particular use of strategy, even if it can be tested through such strategy contests. (529)
</p>

<p>
...resilience - in the competitive logic - is a matter of strategy and its consequences, which establish the advantage or disadvantage of being able to survive the long term and pursue opportunities in the long term. (531)
</p>

<p>
...strategy may contribute to resilience, but it is not its origin or cause. (534)
</p>

<p>
The First Etiology of Resilience: Strategy + Consequences = Resilience (or Lack Thereof) (535)
</p>

<p>
The second test of resilience relies on a different survival logic: that of institutional legitimacy. (537)
</p>

<p>
Therefore, according to the institutional logic, resilience is a matter of the strength of legacy (the strength of the organization's history) and its institutional depth (the degree to which the organization is embedded and interwoven into the society). (545)
</p>

<p>
The Second Etiology of Resilience: Legacy + Institutional Depth = Resilience (or Lack Thereof) (548)
</p>

<p>
The third test of resilience is one of battle hardiness. 8553)
</p>

<p>
According to the toughness logic, resilience is a matter of experiencing hardship, which may have led to diminished expectations and increased self-confidence for survival. It is about making do with very little (and thriving on resource scarcity). (558)
</p>

<p>
The Third Etiology of Resilience:<br>
Experience of Hardship + (Diminished Expectations / Increased Determination) = Resilience (or Lack Thereof) (564)
</p>

<p>
SUMMARY OF THE LOGICS THAT CONTRIBUTE TO RESILIENCE:<br>
Competitive Logics<br>
Value creation<br>
Collaboration<br>
Dominance<br>
Institutional Logics<br>
Heritage or promise: Stand for something.<br>
Legitimacy<br>
Ability to wreak havoc (too big to fail)<br>
Survival Logics<br>
Battle hardy<br>
Strong core (identity)<br>
Resource-scarce survival (568)
</p>

<p>
Corporate resilience is about the capacity to survive the short term while being able to accomplish strategic transformation in the long term (that is, turn threats into opportunities). (582)
</p>

<p>
Thus the better job we do in resilience, the less we are willing to invest in it (paradoxically, something that is working marvelously). (596)
</p>

<p>
...the essence of being resilient is learning without experience. (621)
</p>

<p>
...high success in the past has, over and over again, been seen to result in effects that are known to be detrimental to continued success. Examples of these effects are overconfidence, hubris, and undue attribution of merit to oneself (the fallacy of "I deserved it," which has been shown to emerge even in clinical tests where the "winner" is assigned randomly). (662)
</p>

<p>
Think of past performance, no matter how good or bad, as the enemy of resilience because therein lies many of the company's vulnerabilities. (674)
</p>

<p>
SUMMARY OF THE TOXIC CONSEQUENCES OF PAST PERFORMANCE<br>
High Success<br>
Overconfidence (or insecurity compensation)<br>
Hubris in one's competence<br>
Undue attribution of merit to self<br>
Structural hardening, rigidity<br>
Immoderation and escalation of success formula<br>
Lost capacity for experimentation<br>
Attentive complacency<br>
Mediocre Performance<br>
Conventional thinking<br>

Similarly unambitious reference groups<br>
Interests groups forming to perpetuate status quo<br>
Control of resources by those who benefit from mediocrity<br>
Very Low Performance<br>
Failure traps<br>

Extreme risk taking in case survival is threatened<br>
Inward-focused attention<br>
No one cares. Everyone has given up. (676)
</p>

<p>
WHY GOOD COMPANIES GO BAD<br>
Strategic frames create blinders.<br>
Processes cause routines.<br>
Relationships become shackles.<br>
Values become dogmas. (Sull 1999:45) (690)
</p>

<p>
"An example of processes of inertia is Miller's research (1993; Miller &amp; Chen 1994) demonstrating that inertia is often the unintended consequence of successful performance. Successful organizations discard practices, people, and structures regarded as peripheral to success and grow more inattentive to signals that suggest the need for change, more insular and sluggish in adaptation, and more immoderate in their processes, tending toward extremes of risk-taking or conservatism. These changes simplify the organization, sacrifice adaptability, and increase inertia" (Weick &amp; Quinn 1999:369). (699)
</p>

<p>
...enemy of resilience in that "pure profit maximizing behavior may be at the expense of organizational survival" (D'Aveni &amp; MacMillan 1990:135). (703)
</p>

<p>
In other words, knowing the principles of greatness is not very likely to make you great (beyond hard work and luck, perhaps the only two enduring lessons of the past). (717)
</p>

<p>
Innovations fail at an alarming rate. Depending on the product category, estimates range from between 40 and 90 percent (Gourville, 2006). Explanations for failure are manifold and include product-based, developer-based, and consumer-based reasons for failure (for example, Rogers, 1995; Moore, 1991). (872)  
</p>

<p>
...radical innovation, we follow the definition put forward by Dewar and Dutton (1986: 1422-1423): "Radical innovations ... represent revolutionary changes in technology" as well as ideas, practices, or material artifacts that are "perceived to be new by the relevant unit of adoption" and "represent clear departures from existing practice." (916)
</p>

<p>
It is important to remember to differentiate success from survivability. Many people living in developing countries have developed innovative strategies for survival that may not be successful in any conventional meaning of the term, yet are highly survivable. Similarly, companies that currently enjoy record performance may wish to inquire about the sources of this success: how sustainable and adaptive are they? (1089)
</p>

<p>
It is often said that the resilient organizations should enjoy and even search for hard times as they are the ones to benefit. (1093)
</p>

<p>
Karl Weick's (2000) assertion that "reliability is a dynamic non-event" - constant attention is required to prevent a disaster or an accident. (1104)
</p>

<p>
[Resilience capability] is what the CEO of a very successful U.S. company described: "If I knew where the next challenge will come from, I would be able to defend against it. But it is the challenge I cannot anticipate, that we need grassroots resilience capability for." (1108)
</p>

<p>
...commitment creep: a no-return situation created through cumulative decisions, often by multiple organizational actors. Such commitment creep typically emerges from the company's leadership, but it can occasionally be used deliberately to create a certain desired outcome. (1141)
</p>

<p>
Simon (1947), March and Simon (1958) and more recently Ocasio (1997) have emphasized the limits to human cognition. Time-constrained managers do have to constantly make choices about what to pay attention to, as time does not afford consideration of all matters (Ocasio, 1997). Thus the perpetuation of a particular course of action may be a simple result of the selective intake of information, chosen on the basis of the current strategy. (1159)
</p>

<p>
There are also organizational (or possibly institutional) explanations of commitment creep. The escalation literature is an analysis of the factors driving the ever-deeper commitment. There may be sunk costs, political reasons, and/or ideological or cultural norms that make a turnaround difficult if not impossible (Staw and Ross 1987; Ross and Staw 1993; Brockner 1992). (1173)
</p>

<p>
I propose making the organization - rather than its leadership - resilient. Instead of relying solely on the leader's capacity (whether it's a CEO or a head of government) to take preemptive or corrective action in time, the organization should be imbued with resilience capability. (1234)
</p>

<p>
Resilience building concerns five dimensions that make strong and imaginative organizations: organizational intelligence, resourcing, design, adaptation, and culture (or sisu, a Finnish word suggesting tenacity): <br>
<ol type="1" start="1">
<li>Organizational intelligence ...</li>
<li>Resourcing ...</li>
<li>Design ...</li>
<li>Adaptation ...</li>
<li>Culture ... (1243)</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
... Ashby's law of requisite variety. As the law states the capacity to accommodate environmental change depends on the variety available inside the organization. (1255)
</p>

<p>
Weick (1976) talks about the "cultural insurance" that affords the multitude of interpretations inside an organization. (1257)
</p>

<p>
Schwartz and Randall (2007: 97-98, in Fukuyama 2007), in their discussion on anticipating strategic surprises, recommend being "both imaginative and systematic." Beyond raw labor, it is important to have the knack to put together different bits of information in a way that builds various scenarios and event paths. (1281)
</p>

<p>
Sometimes the most useful strategy may be counterintuitive - rather than hoarding resources for a safety cushion, perhaps the resilient response is to use a resource constraint as a catalyst to develop an innovation capability. (1301)
</p>

<p>
Interestingly, Hagel, Brown and Davison (2009) have found that corporate returns on assets (ROA) in the United States have, since 1965, dropped drastically. Cost savings may be competed away, as the authors suggest, or the leverage strategy is causing a lack of resilience that penalizes companies over time. (1312)
</p>

<p>
Resource-scarce innovation breaks through problems by finding solutions that require radically less (or different) resource usage than before. (1354)
</p>

<p>
ORGANIZATIONAL ROBUSTNESS: RESILIENCE AS A DESIGN ISSUE (1394)
</p>

<p>
Robustness is the system's (or organization's) structural stability to survive challenge while maintaining operability (and reliability). (1395)
</p>

<p>
Robustness is also the capacity to accommodate multiple, different futures (being a "multimission" organization (see Levchuck et al. 2001)). (1397)
</p>

<p>
Robustness can thus be structural (a return to stability) or strategic (dynamically adaptive) in quality. (1399)
</p>

<p>
... structural robustness can be enforced through loose organizational coupling: different organizational parts occasionally communicate but do not depend on each other for operability. (1403)
</p>

<p>
Modularity, or organizational design that can be broken into separate independent parts, similarly adds to robustness but also to flexibility as one part can be replaced without other parts being affected. (Note that robustness is an important operational resilience concept in crisis management, and as such, it is outside the focus of this book.) (1405)
</p>

<p>
Strategic robustness is the ability to accommodate change in a timely, non-traumatic way. (1415)
</p>

<p>
Behavioral Robustness (1429)
</p>

<p>
Padgett and Ansell (1993) study Cosimo de' Medici and his rise to power and control of Firenze during Renaissance: "The Medicean political control was produced by means of network disjunctures within the elite, which the Medici alone spanned" (p. 1259). (1431)
</p>

<p>
... Padgett and Ansell also speak of the multiplicity of behavioral motives that allowed Medici to claim action to be in the city's interests while benefiting his own purposes. Such ambiguity allowed that "everything was done in a response to a flow of requests that, somehow or other, "just so happened" to serve Cosimo's extremely multiple interests" (p. 1263). (1433)
</p>

<p>
... the key to behavioral robustness here is the multivocality - "the fact that single actions can be interpreted coherently from multiple perspectives simultaneously, the fact that single actions can be moves in many games at once, and the fact that public and private motivations cannot be parsed" (p. 1263). (1436)
</p>

<p>
... it is crucial for robust action "not to pursue any specific goals" (p. 1264) or lock the organization into the pursuit of a particular goal in case of change. (1438)
</p>

<p>
"Victory, in Florence, in chess, or in go means locking in others, but not yourself, to goal-oriented sequences of strategic play that become predictable thereby" (p. 1264). (1439)
</p>

<br>
<br>

<p>
ORGANIZATIONAL ADAPTATION: RESILIENCE AS A FITNESS ISSUE (1444)
</p>

<p>
Organizations seek purposefully to better "fit" their environment( that is, have a competitive, profitable business). Researchers differ whether such adaptive intentions are effective: strategic management theorists typically claim timely change as the primary management goal; population ecologists suggest that this is unlikely and organizations should focus on what they do best, reliably. (1445)
</p>

<p>
A case in point, BP, the British energy company, recently reversed course from renewable energy ("beyond petroleum") back to its core oil and gas business. The new CEO, Tony Hayward, suggested in the Financial Times (July 8, 2009:7) that somehow the company "had lost track of" its business fundamentals - that is, what it is good at: "finding oil: high-cost investments that can create big increase in value" (according to a former BP executive). BP had invested substantially in renewable energy during the former CEO Lord Browne's tenure; yet the effort now appeared like a distraction to operational safety. BP's until-then stellar reputation suffered from a number of industrial accidents. (1455)
</p>

<p>
Arguments for Change<br>
Survival depends on responding to changes in the marketplace<br>
It is important to be proactive.<br>
By changing, a company may be able to avoid obsolescence.<br>
Change is fun and helps decrease the boredom of routine.<br>
Arguments against Change<br>
Any change introduces elements that are new and hence potentially risky.<br>
Changes tend to take the focus away from the core business or "job number 1" and thus become distractions.<br>
There is only so much change any organization can accomplish at any one time.<br>
There is resistance to change - and even rejection or fear of it. (1461)
</p>

<p>
Being resilient means making turns even when the road forward still looks passable. It is like going to the gym: you do it (partly for fun but in particular) to stay fit and byild the "change muscles" should they be needed. (1489)
</p>

<p>
A common challenge to companies facing disruptive strategies by their competitors is that they lack any effective responses (Christensen 1997). Similarly, it is probably difficult to create truly novel management innovations. Thus managers tend to refer to and copy so-called best practices (what other companies are doing) as solutions to their management problems. (1740)
</p>

<p>
...resilience in this case was learning a problem-solving methodology rather than a single solution. (1782)
</p>

<p>
...resilience is likely to reside in the generative dance between what is known and what can be done. (1786)
</p>

<p>
At the same time, the senior managers [of AT&amp;T] tried to convince themselves that other incumbent telcos imitating AT&amp;T was the best compliment, and they sought comfort in strategy convergence. Unfortunately, in the world of strategy, such convergence spells bad news (or at least low profit margins). 1824)
</p>

<p>
Amateurism is most suited for task environments that require taking risks and making discoveries. (2187)
</p>

<p>
Yet this evolution [of Howard Dean's presidential campaign] was not a foresight that Howard Dean possessed as a stretched goal or aspiration early in the campaign - it was the unfolding capacity of the (open) organization to accomplish more than was ever hoped for initially. In other words, the campaign's potential was discovered rather than "designed." (2404)
</p>

<p>
Open, participatory conceptions of organizing offer a way to escape the kind of dull-execution mentality that results from the top management team's setting the strategy while everyone else is called on simply to execute and meet the preset target goals (Bossidy et al. 2002). Instead, through instances like the Dean campaign, organized activities become experimental playgrounds where the management task is creating the architectures of contribution so that the potential contributions of many participants are actualized and assembled into a joint effort rather than dissipated. Such an approach does not guarantee that the desired outcomes will be achieved (nor does any other kind of organizing by the way), but it invites more experimentation (and thus requisite variety) to find, when apprpriate selection mechanisms are applied, the most promising avenues of action. (2412)
</p>

<br>
<br>

<p>
To see a strategy as appropriate because it is the same as that of other firms in its industry is common in institutionalized organizational fields (Scott and Meyer 1991), but it is inconsistent with success in competitive fields where many firms doing the same thing quickly turn a profitable product into a commodity (Porter 1980). (2459)
</p>

<p>
AT&amp;T's planning resembled systems described in Grant (2003), who notes that they help firms adapt to turbulence but rarely support nonincremental innovation. (2462)
</p>

<p>
Economics' standard definition [of institutions] is accepted by most institutional economists: "the underlying rules of the game" (North 1990). 2520)
</p>

<p>
Oliver's (1997) definition [of institutions]: actions that tend to be enduring, socially accepted, resistant to change, and not directly reliant on rewards or monitoring." (2523)
</p>

<p>
DiMaggio (1988) describes the deliberate creation of institutional change as "institutional entrepreneurship" and each individual effort as an "institutionalization project." He argues that successful creation of new institutions "is a product of the political efforts of actors to accomplish their ends and that the success of an institutionalization project and the form that the resulting institution takes depend on the relative power of the actors who support, oppose, or otherwise strive to influence it." (2569)
</p>

<p>
Some innovation-supporting institutions seem to emerge because someone improvises one big innovation, and then others try to learn from the process, generating a routine (Wood et al. 2004). Whether new institutions are improvised or deliberately chosen, however, DiMaggio argues that goal-oriented struggles create them. (2575)
</p>

<p>
...the political problem that DiMaggio (1988) and Fligstein (1997) have seen as central: creation of a core group powerful enough to truly change the rules. (2632)
</p>

<p>
...it does matter which management ideas get invened in the first place and eventually included in the repertoire of new and standard management practices. (2671)
</p>

<p>
As a rule, only if they themselves have been involved in the planning and execution of fact-finding, do the practicioners gain the insight and interest necessary for social action (Lewin 1945:132) (2692)
</p>

<p>
...inventive experimentation is here defined as a commitment to the creation and prototyping of seemingly novel management actions, processes, and principles. (2747)
</p>

<p>
...there is a line of research that suggests organizations - like living organisms - should manifest "requisite variety" (dating back to Ashby 1956). (2782)

Boland and Collopy (2004:9) call for a shift in researcher attitude: "A design attitude views each project as an opportunity for invention that includes a questioning of basic assumptions and a resolve to leave the world a better place than we found it." (2867)
</p>

<p>
Management research has been criticized for its backward-looking posture: One problematic consequence of researchers being able to choose what they study has been a focus on the past (Starbuck 2006). Data are always retrospective, and theories consistent with retrospective data may not describe the future or even the present. In a challenge to the usefulness of such research, Platt (1964) argued that theoretical progress depends on confronting theories with crucial experiments that rule out unproductive lines of thought. Because researchers can craft retrospective theories to make them consistent with prominent stylized facts, these theories never appear utterly inadequate, and so testing them never rules out unproductive lines of thought. To expose the limitations of theories, organization researchers and designers alike have to use theories to predict and then they have to verify whether what happens corresponds to what they predicted. Organization design is an important and interesting area because it requires designers to make predictions, and it then generates evidence about the extent that predictions prove out in practice. (Dunbar and Starbuck 2006) (2882)

<p>
McKelvey (1997) suggests paradigm proliferation in organization science is due to the difficulty of refuting competing claims across paradigms as they are not testable. While the purpose of inventive experimentation is not focused on testing predictions of existing theories in practice, it does offer an avenue for playing out the implications of current management theory in specific experiments. (2891)

...as certain research traditions become established, they become desirable as entry points for young scholars looking to build their scholarly reputations. This desirability may be entirely endogenous (that is, grown within) to the scholarly community, however, who through a peer-review process assess the validity of a research paper (leaving managers, journalists, and other societal stake-holders out of the evaluation). This is not to say that the academic community is not the right audience to assess a scholarly contribution; it is, however, to acknowledge that this assessment is exclusive and is not subject to the test of other, exogenous, criteria (like practitioners' views). (2919)

...managers do not (often) intentionally set out to invent new management practice either. Rather, such activity appears to be serendipitous, not planned (see Birkinshaw et al. 2005). (2931)

<p>
My central thesis is that resilience is something that needs to be rehearsed, not just planned for. (3024)
</p>

<p>
Said a manager in a leading U.S. corporation in a quest for resilience: Resilience is like a muscle - we will need to build it so that we have it when the tiger is on our tail. (3027)
</p>

<p>
...resilience is not a strategy; it is a rehearsal. (3033)
</p>

<p>
"Resilience will become something like an autonomic process only when companies dedicate as much energy to laying the groundwork for perpetual renewal as they have to building the foundations for operational efficiency." (Hamel and Välikangas 2003) (3057)
</p>

<p>
Resilience, like life, comes in different colors and shapes. (3064)

<p>
...the tiger-on-your-tail kind of need for resilience. (3065)<br>
...resilience that sustains the company in between strategy shifts (3066)
