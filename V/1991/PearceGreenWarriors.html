<li>53, discussing the early stages of FoE in Britain:</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
- Sellafield’s reputation was largely generated by Pete Wilkinson (Greenpeace) and Bryn Jones, Daily Mirror’s industrial editor (and Greenpeace activist). The two knew each other <br>
In October 1975, Jones told his readers in bold black type on the front page of the Mirror about a PLAN TO MAKE BRITAIN WORLD’S NUCLEAR DUSTBIN. It was a fine phrase, picked up from an article written earlier that year by FoE’s nuclear expert, Walt Patterson. An American who had settled in London with his British wife, Patterson remembers Jones’s piece well: “Factually, it was so riddled with inaccuracies. But it hit the fan. “ 
</p>

<p>
<ol type="a" start="16">
<li>56: FoE was more cerebral and cautious in its statements than GP. For example, at Windscale inquiry Patterson at FoE said that he wasn’t that concerned about radioactive waste that might be accumulating on mudbanks in the nearby Ravenglass estuary or contaminating sea life:</li>
</ol>
“So they might,” he says today. “But I’ve never been too concerned about nuclear seaweed. There are hazards, but they are generally no worse than other industrial hazards. I said that at the Windscael inquiry, mentioning lead in exhausts as one example, and I was heavily criticised for it by other groups.”
</p>

<p>
57: GP throwing unsupported accusations:
</p>

<p>
Frustration with their failure to dent the British nuclear industry led to a certain recklessness at Greenpeace by Jones and Wilkinson, who began to see conspiracies everywhere. In 1984, there was mounting public concern about the safety of flasks that carried nuclear waste on the nation’s railways from power stations to Sellafield. There was talk that a railway accident could cover whole cities with fallout, making them uninhabitable. To stem the tide of speculation the state-owned Central Electricity Generating Board planned a spectacular public demonstration. It staged an accident, in full view of TV cameras, in which a train ran at 100 mph into the side of a flask. The flask was undamaged. But Greenpeace’s George Pritchard called foul. He publicly alleged that engine mounting bolts had been removed from the locomotive for the demonstration, so reducing the severity of the impact on the nuclear flask. When challenged, he admitted to having no evidence for this charge and was later forced into making a full written apology.

<ol type="a" start="16">
<li>287, discussing the initial reaction of environmental groups to greenhouse effect (note that most environmental organizations were latecomers to the climate change fight)</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
More troublesome was the issue of nuclear power. By the late 1980s, many energy campaigners in environmental groups were getting bored and looking for new challenges. Most had been appointed to oppose nuclear power; but as the economic and safety cases for nuclear power had collapsed, few countries were building nuclear any more. So the energy campaigners latched on to the greenhouse effect - and were immediately faced with their old foes, the nuclear companies, desperate for orders, arguing that nuclear power would save us from the greenhouse horrors. <br>
In both Britain and the US, groups such as FoE spent much of their time during 1989 countering this claim. It seemed myopic, but many politicians appeared to be doing the same thing from the other side. It was as if both sides felt happiest refighting this old war. FoE in Britain headed up a cul-de-sac, commissioning research to shatter the “myth” that nuclear power produces no carbon dioxide. All it meant by this was that some carbon dioxide is used in building power stations and in mining uranium. It was hardly an exciting finding. Slightly more promisingly, however, Greenpeace assembled a long list of distinguished scientists, including the Nobel-prize-winning chemist Dorothy Hodgkin, to declare on the eve of a British nuclear conference that nuclear power was “irrelevant” to combating the greenhouse effect.<br>
The essence of the argument was that measures to improve national efficiency in energy use were up to seven times more cost-effective than  nuclear power in reducing carbon dioxide emissions. That is, a pound spent on promoting energy <br>
288<br>
efficiency will prevent seven times more carbon dioxide being produced than a pound spent on building nuclear power stations.<br>
The source of this claim was a study published in 1988 by the Rocky Mountain Institute, a research outfit in Colorado run by one of FoE’s original anti-nuclear campaigners in Britain, a physicist called Amory Lovins. As a centre for research into energy saving, the Institute was grinding its own axe, though its figures have not been seriously contested. However, their use in Britain was a little tendentious. Anybody who read the original report would have discovered that the “seven times more cost-effective” figure applied specifically to the US, which is a grossly energy-inefficient nation. For Europe the report gave a figure of around three times. None of the British campaigners mentioned this point.
