A Kentucky psychologist later explained the irrational fuel rush as a knee-jerk reaction: “those people had been at work all day, not able to do anything, thinking about previous incidents that had caused gas shortages.” Another psychologist speculated, “they wanted to have a sense of control, not feel stranded or trapped in any way” 2

green behavior continues to trigger equal and opposite reactions in those who hold different beliefs. In the years leading up to the automobile industry’s 2008–9 crash, an especially intense area of eco-conflict concerned choice of personal transportation. there arose a war of words (and sometimes spray paint and tire irons, on both sides) between Hummer owners and their critics (the latter often branded as “tofu-eating Prius drivers,” and many did in fact own hybrid cars). that conflict grew, according to marketing researcher Marius luedicke and colleagues, into a “nationalistic morality play

Prices are the key to efficiency in market economies. they direct resources toward more profitable uses by industry; then, once industry has turned out commodities, prices ration the commodities among consumers. that is said to provide maximum benefit to society as a whole, because the ways in which people spend their money reflect what they believe will increase their own well-being. but do markets really zero in on the optimum distribution? <b>“the thesis that efficiency maximizes welfare,” the economist Mark Sagoff has written, “states a specious tautology, since ‘welfare’ and ‘efficiency’ are both defined in terms of ‘willingness-to-pay’</b> ”; furthermore, willingness to pay can be expressed only by those with the ability to pay. And it has long been well known that when consumers make purchases, they are not simply <a href="..\..\ZK\USKO\TeknoLOGOS\Tehokkuususko.html" title="ZK:USKO:TeknoLOGOS:Tehokkuususko" class="page">ZK:USKO:TeknoLOGOS:Tehokkuususko</a>
</p>

<p>
expressing preferences that spring from somewhere deep within. back in 1958, for example, the Harvard economist Edward Mason argued that in the then-new era of the giant corporation and “managerialism,” consumers often did not even have the chance to express their preferences. Rather, their purchasing patterns were being largely dictated by those from whom they were buying. this didn’t fit the theory of classical economics, in which, Mason wrote, “ ‘tastes’ or ‘wants’ on the demand side and, on the supply side, technological and resource limitations to production were ‘given data’ ” and the test of an economic system “lay in the efficiency with which it accomplished, within these limitations, the satisfaction of human wants.” In the twentieth century, things had changed: 
</p>

<p>
<i>In an economy whose supreme talent is devoted not only to the creation of the new product but to making the customer like it, [consumer] sovereignty turns out to be limited indeed. the consumer may have a biological need for food but not necessarily in cellophane wrapping; he may have a culturally determined desire for transportation, but he can presumably get there without fins on his car. . . . If this is so, what happens to the doctrine of consumer sovereignty and the tests of the efficiency of an economic system that are cast in terms of its capacity to satisfy human wants? the measuring rod turns out to be highly elastic—to be extended or shrunk at the whim of those who manage the system.18</i>
</p>

<h3>How inequality hurts</h3>

<br>

<p>
In many situations, markets turn out to be highly inefficient, and they fail.19 In other situations, even when the economy is operating at high efficiency, it can produce results that “may well be thoroughly unequal and nasty,” in the words of the noted economist Amartya sen.20 When resources go to the high bidders, the economic tide may rise, but only for those who have a boat—and yachts always rise the fastest.21
</p>

<p>
Consider quinoa. three to four thousand years ago, farmers in south America took a wild plant species with edible seeds called Chenopodium quinoa and, through observation and selective breeding over many generations, increased the yield and size of the plants’ seeds,
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
thereby giving their continent, and eventually the world, a new grain crop. today, with its tastiness, high nutritional value, and association with an exotic ancient civilization, quinoa grain has become popular in north America and Europe as an alternative to cereal grains such as wheat and rice.22 In 2011, the New York Times reported from bolivia that “demand for quinoa is soaring in rich countries, as American and European consumers discover the ‘lost crop’ of the Incas. the surge has helped raise farmers’ incomes here in one of the hemisphere’s poorest countries. but there has been a notable trade-off: fewer bolivians can now afford it, hastening their embrace of cheaper, processed foods and raising fears of malnutrition in a country that has long struggled with it.” the problem was that health-conscious consumers in the global north had stimulated exports of quinoa, driving up prices in its region of origin. the Times noted that although bolivia’s malnutrition rate as measured nationwide has fallen in recent years, the rate of chronic malnutrition in children has risen, specifically in quinoa-growing areas. Asked about the situation, the president of the Quinoa Corporation of los Angeles responded with cool rationality: “It’s kind of discouraging to see stuff like this happen, but that’s part of life and economics.” 23
</p>

<p>
Countless such situations illustrate the principle that even when markets work as intended and at high efficiency, they allocate resources “toward those who have money and unmet wants, not toward those who have unmet needs,” in the words of the ecological economist Joshua Farley. one of Farley’s choice examples of prices in action concerns a pharmaceutical compound called eflornithine, which kills the parasite that causes East African sleeping sickness.24 the company Hoechst Marion Roussel began to manufacture the drug in 1990, but soon after Hoechst was bought by the pharmaceutical giant Aventis in 1995, the new owners noted the inadequate profits generated by eflornithine and began phasing it out. by 1998, little or no supply remained; approximately three hundred thousand people contracted sleeping sickness that year in Africa, with tens of thousands dying. Farley writes: 
</p>

<p>
<i>Although the only other treatment for second-stage sleeping sickness [a concoction that is, according to one observer, essentially “arsenic dissolved in antifreeze” 25] is extremely painful to</i> 
</p>

<p>
10
</p>

<p>
<i>administer, often ineffective, and often lethal, Aventis could not profit from selling [eflornithine] to poor Africans and discontinued production for that purpose. At the same time, however, bristol Myers squibb and Gillette were profitably producing eflornithine to remove unwanted facial hair in women. Aventis and bristol Myers squibb agreed to again produce eflornithine for the treatment of African sleeping sickness only after the nGo Médecins sans Frontières threatened to publicize the issue.26</i> 
</p>

<p>
Had the market been left to its own devices, he notes, the rationing function of prices would have reserved eflornithine exclusively for cosmetic purposes rather than for saving lives. Another of Farley’s cautionary tales is the 2001 electricity crisis in California, which triggered “rolling blackouts” and financially crippled power utilities. When energy trading companies, led by Enron Corporation, created shortages in the state’s recently deregulated power industry, they caused wholesale electricity prices to jump by as much as 800 percent, with economic turmoil and suffering the result. the loss to the state was estimated at more than $40 billion. that same year, brazil had a nationwide electricity shortfall of 10 percent, which was proportionally larger than the shortage in California. but the brazilian government avoided inflation and blackouts simply by capping prices and limiting all customers, residential and commercial, to 10 percent lower consumption than that of the previous year, with severe penalties for exceeding the limit. no significant suffering resulted. the California crisis is viewed as one of America’s worst energy disasters, but, says Farley, “no one even remembers a ‘crisis’ in brazil in 2001.” 27

<p>
Rationing of water to those who can afford to spend the most has had profound consequences around the world.28 the more extreme the wealth gap, it seems, the more unfair the allocation. From a survey of tropical tourist destinations in Africa and Asia, the london-based nonprofit tourism Concern concluded in a 2012 report that “tourism development is negatively impacting the quality, availability and accessibility of freshwater for local people, amounting to an infringement of their water and sanitation rights.” In Zanzibar, for example, resort 
</p>

<p>
hotels and guesthouses sited in three coastal villages consume 180 to 850 gallons of water per room per day (with the more luxurious hotels consuming the most), while local households have access to only 25 gallons per day for all purposes. Each of the villages depends on a small electric pump for its supply, and the power is often interrupted; meanwhile, the hotels employ more powerful, higher-volume pumps, with the result that water pressure in the villages is further reduced. In southern India, luxury tourist houseboats that ply the scenic backwaters of Kerala are using the waterways not only for transportation (leaking gas and oil in the process) but also as a toilet and garbage receptacle. Most local people depend on the backwaters for all their water needs and for the fish they eat; now pollution is rendering their water undrinkable, and their fish often tastes like kerosene. And in the Gambia, on the west coast of Africa, tourist hotels are supplied with ample water through systems of oversized pipes and can store it in large reserve tanks, while 75 percent of households in the area have no piped water at all.29
</p>

<p>
In these few examples spanning four continents, the distorted distribution of food, drugs, energy, and water is striking. Ill effects of rationing by price are especially troubling when, as in these cases, they affect commodities that in certain quantities are recognized as necessities— and that people often desire to acquire them in much larger quantities. In times of scarcity, whether encountered or created, governments sometimes build a floor under consumption to secure basic needs at<br>
the bottom of the economy, and they often find it necessary also to put a ceiling in place as well, to conserve resources that would otherwise be consumed in excess by some. In other words, they practice rationing by means other than price. the mechanisms for nonprice rationing are many and varied. the more familiar include rationing by queuing, as at the gas pump in the 1970s; by time, as with day-of-week lawn sprinkling during droughts; by lottery, as with immigration visas and some clinical trials of scarce drugs; by triage, as in battlefield or emergency medicine; by straight quantity, as governments did with gasoline, tires, and shoes during World War II; or by keeping score with a nonmonetary device such as carbon emissions or the points that were assigned to meats and canned goods in wartime. Whether to ration by price and,
</p>

<p>
12
</p>

<p>
if not, the choice among other means of rationing can have profound consequences. Any way you slice it, the manner in which we share the burden of scarcity is something that arises from conscious choices. Resources don’t decide for themselves where to go.
</p>

<p>
As we will see, rationing of household consumption does not work as a primary means of limiting total resource use; rather, it is a measure that becomes necessary when the use of resources “upstream,” in production, is limited. should shortages strike on continental or global scales sometime in the future, or if governments should begin treating fossil fuels as if they are scarce, as part of an effort to curb ecological disruption, then rationing by price could create intolerable hardship for many. If it becomes clear that nonprice rationing is necessary, societies can learn from past experience; wartime provides many of the most-discussed examples, but, as we will see, there are many others. nonprice rationing has so far been employed chiefly as a response to temporary scarcity in specific geographical areas. Might we one day face global, persistent scarcity and along with it the prospect of formal rationing? It is not just a hypothetical question. We are seeing a continuous stream of research-journal articles and news stories, and shelves full of books, anticipating a future racked by ecological breakdown, resource depletion, and scarcity.30 be assured that this book isn’t one of those; in my view, the healthiest approach to the forecasts of gloom and doom hanging over us is to weigh them seriously but then move on quickly to consider what can be done. What societies have done before and what we could do in the future in four crucial realms of life—energy, water, food, and medical care—will be the subjects of the chapters that follow.
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, attempts to limit greenhouse emissions through a combination of weak treaties and market mechanisms have continued to stumble over issues of fairness. those efforts have failed because, as the economist James K. Galbraith argues, “polite” approaches do not go far enough, and explicit planning is required. Whether we see it or not, he adds, “in the modern world, planning happens: it is what corporations exist to do. the only issue, therefore, is whether the planning function is to be left entirely in the hands of private corporations . . . or whether the government and the larger public are entitled to play a role.”
</p>

<p>
Although in today’s political world, Galbraith notes, “syphilis, leprosy, and planning more or less rank together” in popularity, we may be living in a very different world before long.31 If we allow the future to be created by veiled corporate planning, the fairly predictable consequence will be resource conflicts between the haves and have-nots—or rather, among the haves, the hads, and the never-hads. Even if we wrest planning out of corporate hands, it is not so obvious what to do next or what the consequences will be. nevertheless, we can try to foresee those consequences, with some help from past and current efforts to plan rationally.
</p>

<p>
For now, none of that is happening. And it is not just a witless devotion to consumption for the sake of consumption that is responsible for our resisting any attempt at restraint. It’s quite possible (indeed very common, I would guess) to be simultaneously concerned about the fate of the Earth and worried that the necessary degree of restraint just isn’t achievable.
