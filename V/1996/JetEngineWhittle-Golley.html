 “One of Whittle’s major problems was the availability of…”<br>
 81 <br>
 “…materials for the turbine capable of withstanding the combination of stress and temperature which the design required. To some extent there had been a vicious circle operating creating a chicken and egg situation. Until suitable materials existed, a gas turbine was not a practical possibility. On the other hand, until the gas turbine itself existed, there was no demand for the materials. <br>
 Yet his turbojet design and the materials problem were inseparable. Looking around to find specialized companies who would be prepared to help him was a daunting and difficult task. His requirements were way beyond existing standards, and his financial resources were totally inadequate to promote the necessary research which manufacturers would have to undertake. Power Jets at this time consisted only of a board of directors with no back-up facilities and little finance. Some manufacturers interested in Whittle’s proposals might have been willing to spend money on research and development, provided that the market for an eventual product would support the investment. But Whittle could give no such assurance. Only his drive, brilliance, and ability to sell his revolutionary ideas to hard-headed and conservative engineers got things moving at all.<br>
 These visits to various specialised companies up and down the country were to have a greater significance. Whittle was cutting across traditional thinking and waking up British Industry. His challenge to industry to provide materials which would give the necessary strength at the high temperatures involved was to make his turbojet a reality, and within a few years give Britain a significant lead in jet technology.<br>
 He was helped, to some extent, in his search for new materials by the increasing demands made on the exhaust valves of existing aero engines. This had resulted in steady progress in developing creep-resistant steels. Creep is the slow stretching which a high stress causes in a material at a high temperature. He was delighted to discover that an austenitic steel known as Stayblade, made by Firth Vickers, would apparently be suitable for the wheen and blades of his turbine: “Materials for the compressor impeller and casing presented a less serious problem, because they were not exposed to very high temperatures. Nevertheless, they had to be of very good quality, particularly in the case of the highly stressed impeller. For this we selected an aluminium alloy know as RR.56 — a product of High Duty Alloys.”<br>
 82<br>
 “During the latter part of 1936 Sir Henry Tizard, the Chairman of the Aeronautical Research Committee which advised the Air Ministry on future research, began to become increasingly interested in the project. Tizard expressed the view that it was about time that someone made a bold experiment of this kind, though he thought that Power Jets would have to be prepared for a long series of costly experiments before a tolerable efficiency would be obtained.<br>
 Sir Henry’s views and his influence set off a chain of events which began to look promising for Power Jets. The Director of Scientific Research asked Power Jets to submit a write up of the engine, and said that this would be sent to the RAE (Royal Aircraft Establishment) for their opinion. At the same time it was hinted that the Aeronautical Research Committee might take the view that the work of Power Jets might justify some financial assistance from the Air Ministry towards the cost of research.<br>
 — Dr Griffith, then Head of the Engine Section of the RAE and a believer in the gas turbine as a means of driving a propellor, was asked to study the Power Jets situation and make a report<br>
 p. 121:<br>
 “As Whittle began to run his engine more frequently and at higher speeds there were clear indications that the Stayblade steel from which the turbine disc and blades were made was not good enough for the running conditions in the engine: “Had we been clear of combustion troubles, and had the turbine and compressor been as efficient as had been assumed in the design, then theoretically at least, the Stayblade steel from which the turbine blades were made had properties good enough for the purpose. But the component efficiencies were much lower than the design assumptions. Added to this, one of the so far unsolved elements of the combustion problem was bad temperature distribution, which unfortunately usually resulted in the hotter gases impinging on the tubine blades near their roots, where the stress was highest.” Saddled with the problems of turbine blades and combustion, Whittle searched for better materials and improved methods. He was working in new dimensions, and only leading specialists in the fields of creep-resisting materials and fuels could help him. <br>
 He approached Dr Colin Smithells of Lodge Plugs to discuss the possibility of using ceramics, either alone or in combination with metal. Smithells put him in touch with Dr Pfiel of Henry Wiggin &amp; Co, because he thoughtthere was a good chance of a nickel-chrome alloy (similar to the Inconel used in elements for electric fires) having creep-resistant properties good enough for Whittle’s purpose. But Pfiel couldn’t help him at the time. This was very unfortunate because, had Pfiel and his colleagues started the work then, at least a year might have been saved. <br>

 All these efforts on Whittle’s part, in his quest for new materials and methods, were a great challenge to those in British Industry concerned with high-temperature alloys. His enthusiasm and drive encouraged them to meet the demands of a new technology, which was to revolutionize aero-engine development. It was fortunate for Britain to have a man of Whittle’s genius, drive and dedication at this time, because in early 1939 there had been vague references to German work. These came chiefly through Air Commodore Weir of J. &amp; G. Weir Ltd, who were<br>
 122<br>
 shareholders in Power Jets. A German engineer who had recently joined his staff had said that there were several jet propulsion projects under development in Germany, but he did not know what form they were taking. <br>
 …<br>
 The Germans and the British were not the only people working on gas turbines at this time. The Swiss Company of Brown-Boveri had over many years put a considerable effort into the development of industrial gas turbines, and a lecture on the subject was given by their Dr Adolf Meyer to the Institution of Mechanical Engineers in London in February 1939. Whittle, Bramson and Cheshire attended this lecture together. Dr Meyer made no reference to any proposed aircraft application. In the subsequent discussion Whittle pointed out that the gas turbine was specially attractive from the aircraft point of view and that there was a very good reason why it should be more successful in this field than in any other. He was, of course, careful to avoid any reference to its application as a jet propulsion device, or to give any indication of the work he was doing. In his reply Dr Meyer was sceptical about the possibility of an aircraft application. <br>

 “Without Whittle, these parts of the world’s first turbojets would never even have been designed. It was Frank Whittle himself who had to tell everyone how to create them, often using very special alloys, and it was very hard for him to tolerate a situation in which those who had founded a new industry were deprived of the right to design and make even experimental engines.”

 “The Specification for the W.1 was remarkably similar to that for the original build of the WU as run in April 1937; figures asterisked were unchanged: compressor impeller tip diameter 19 in*; impeller tip width 2 in*; outer diameter of eye 10.75 in*; inner diameter of eye 5.5 in*; number of blades 29; material Hiduminium RR.59 (1937 alloy was RR.56); compressor casing magensium alloy 299 to DTD.350; turbine blade mean diameter 14 in*; blade length 2.4 in*; blade material Firth-Vickers Rex 78 (1937, Stayblade); blade chord 0.8 in*; number of blades 72 (1937, 66); disc material Firth-Vickers Stayblade*; maximum speed 17,750 rpm. Maximum achieved speed was 17,000 rpm, at which the mass flow was about 22 lb/s at 36 lb/sq in gauge, exhaust (jetpipe) temperature 870°K, thrust 950 lb and specific fuel consumption about 1.37.”

 p. 256<br>
 “Accordingly Power Jets spent much of 1940 designing a less critical engine, the W.2B, and this was planned as the engine of the F.9/40 (later Meteor) twin-engined fighter. Complete sets of Power Jets W.2B drawings were passed to the several companies involved in manufacture, though the first two engines to be tested were made by Rover and again differed from the Power Jets design. Meanwhile, in 1941 Power Jets and BTH jointly built the W.2 Mk IV, or W.2/4, which was a W.2 modified in stages to bring it nearer to W.2B standard. Most unfortunately, this was totally wrecked at about 9,000 rpm on its first run with a new impeller, though none of the four people inside the test chamber was seriously injured. The reason was a previously undetected crack across the impeller forging almost across a diameter.<br>
 The W.2B development proved to be troublesome and very protracted. Difficulties included surging, high jpt, turbine blade failures and many other kinds of mechanical failure. Whittle advised Rover that he was convinced the 1,600 lb design thrust would be reached with a 5° twist of the turbine blades, but the advice was ignored. Rover’s own (secret from Power Jets) “development” was a disaster, being stuck at around 1,000 lb. Eventually Whittle was forced to the conclusion that Rover’s grip on the W.2B had precluded proper development. Accordingly, on 2 March 1942 design began on a complete redesign, the W.2/500. It was the first engine built mainly by Power Jets, and the design, construction and initial testing were all completed in six months, full design rpm being reached on 2 September 1942. Much of the success of the W.2/500 was due to improvement in turbine blade material, notably the development by Mond Nickel of the nickel-chromium alloy Nimonic 80: The results achieved with the W.2B/500 plotted so exactly on the design curves that Whittle was misled into declaring “jet engine design has become an exact science”. So it did later become, but Power Jets still had to endure a 1942 puctuated by every kind of disappointment, including random failures of W.1A turbine blades…”
