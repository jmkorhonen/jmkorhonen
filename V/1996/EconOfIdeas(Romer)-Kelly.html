By now the masses have virtually abandoned economists. Few any longer believe that practitioners of the dismal science, even equipped with today's advanced mathematical models and powerful computers, can calculate the prospects for unemployment or inflation #this year, let alone next. Economists have fallen in public estimation to the level of weather forecasters - both have been wrong just once too often.
</p>

<p>
If economists show little skill predicting events 12 months out, their luck in predicting long-term prospects - over decades, even centuries - hasn't fared much better. During the early 1800s, stockbroker-turned-economist David Ricardo propounded the dark view that scarce land and diminishing returns would inevitably undermine the future. More than a century later, John Maynard Keynes continued the doomsday march with his 1930 essay "Economic Possibilities for Our Grandchildren," which set out the thesis that wealth creation was bound to taper off. Market economies, thought Keynes, had seen their best days. The great man of 20th-century economics predicted that capitalism would slowly disappear, to be replaced by community and egalitarianism.
</p>

<p>
Tell that to Bill Gates.
</p>

<p>
But after a legacy of failure, an explanation of why economies expand and a set of coherent policies to promote growth may be at hand. And for that, the economics world can thank a rather unlikely hero, Paul Romer. The lively, bespectacled economist from the University of California at Berkeley is almost completely unknown outside the academic community. You won't find the 40-year-old self-proclaimed Deadhead sounding off about economic prospects on Sunday-morning news shows, or advising politicians - except his father, Roy, the Democratic governor of Colorado. Instead, the man superstar economist Paul Krugman says "busted the study of economic growth wide open" labors in near obscurity, shuttling between his office at Cal and another at Stanford's Hoover Institution.
</p>

<p>
There's an obvious explanation for Romer's lack of exposure: his work is highly theoretical, and his papers are peppered with dense algebraic equations and arguments that turn on something called the mathematics of convex sets. None of this detracts from the power of his central claim - that new ideas, embedded in technological change, drive economic growth and allow us to escape the gaunt future economists have so often imagined.<br>

<p>
Call Romer an economist for the technological age. The world, in Romer's view, isn't defined by scarcity and limits on growth. Instead, it's a playground of nearly unbounded opportunity, where new ideas beget new products, new markets, and new possibilities to create wealth. "Old growth theory says we have to decide how to allocate scarce resources among alternative uses," says Romer. "New growth theory says, 'Bullshit!' We're in this world, it's got some objects, sure, but it's got these ideas, too, and all that stuff about scarcity and price systems is just wrong.'"
</p>

<p>
Romer burst onto the economics scene in 1986, with the first in a series of path-finding papers that revived the study of economic growth, which had been moribund for a generation. "Paul single-handedly turned it into a hot subject," says MIT economist and Nobel laureate Robert Solow. During the 1950s, economists, led by Solow, had fashioned some bare-bones models and concluded that technological change accounted for about 80 percent of economic growth. But they failed to specify what technology meant, and the model they devised gave no hint of how to figure it out or encourage its development.
</p>

<p>
This wasn't necessarily the result of stupidity. Economists in the postwar years "were mainly concerned about preventing another depression. That was on everyone's mind," says University of Chicago economist Robert Lucas, one of Romer's mentors. Economists pretty much aimed to prevent inflation and unemployment from running amok. But as the Great Depression receded into memory, economics students began to seek other challenges. And Romer, who studied physics in college but passed up law school to tackle economics, became captivated by the question of what drives economic growth.<br>

</p>

<p>
It was a fertile field. For generations, mainstream economists had expected growth in the industrialized countries to taper off. Expecting diminishing returns - the idea that the punch provided by adding yet another farm, factory, or worker declines over time - economists, like cultists awaiting the apocalypse, had long looked to the day growth would end. But decade after decade, the economy defied their expectations. And by the time Romer arrived on the scene, new economies to the East, led by Japan, were exploding forth. Says Romer: "I looked at the problem and said, 'This theory doesn't have any clothes on,' and proceeded to start work on it."
</p>

<p>
Romer's central contribution is the construction of a model that lays bare the crucial role ideas play in driving growth. Like most economists, Romer begins his project by splitting the world into two parts - physical objects and ideas. (Traditional economists divide the world into wants and physical objects, such as corn or automobiles. And because physical objects are subject to scarcity, economists conclude that the only real decision left for people is how to allocate scarce resources to maximize wealth.) To Romer, objects include everything around us, from huge steel mills to carbon and oxygen atoms. Taken as they are, objects are scarce and subject to the law of diminishing returns. Alone, they cannot drive economic growth. But ideas can. Human beings, Romer says, possess a nearly infinite capacity to reconfigure physical objects by creating new recipes for their use. By coming up with new ideas on how to increase, say, the power of a microprocessor, humans can boost productivity, spawn new opportunities for profit, and ultimately drive economic growth.
</p>

<p>
And the great thing about ideas, says Romer, is that they are nearly limitless. "On the ideas side you have combinatorial explosion," he says. "There's essentially no scarcity to deal with." Take, for instance, all the possible bitstreams you can turn into a CD-ROM. The number, he notes, comes to something in the range of 10 to the power of 1 billion, virtually ensuring that we'll never run out of software to discover. "There isn't enough mass in the universe to make that number of CDs," he says. Romer argues that because the number of ways to rearrange an object and to create something of greater value is so vast, the prospects for economic growth are far greater than economists would normally have us believe.
</p>

<p>
His favorite illustration of what is possible is a brainteaser. Using chemical reactions, he observes, we can reorder carbon and hydrogen into structures like new polymers and proteins. To see how far this process can go, he asks us to imagine the chemical refinery of the future. It would be small and mobile enough to search out its own inputs, capable of maintaining a constant temperature, self-healing, and able to replace itself - and do all this without human intervention. But, Romer notes, this refinery already exists - the milk cow. His point? If hundreds of millions of years of evolution can produce the cow, there must be a huge number of recipes for combining atoms that we haven't even discovered. Indeed, he points out, scientists are already changing the DNA of cattle, attempting to produce cows that secrete lactoserrin (a protein in breast milk that helps to protect babies against infection) into their milk.
</p>

<p>
Despite the bovine metaphor, Romer draws most of his examples from the world of emerging technologies. It's not just that his hobbies include devouring books about biology (his current favorite is Darwin's Dangerous Idea by Daniel Dennett) and tinkering with a three-computer network - complete with coaxial cable - he installed at home. It's that biotechnology and computers point to one of his central lessons: human's constantly underestimate how many ideas remain to be discovered.<br>

</p>

<p>
But more important for the economic world, Romer says, new technologies like biotech help demolish the old specter of diminishing returns, which led economic thinkers such as Ricardo and Keynes to suppose that growth had its limits. Instead, these new technologies create increasing returns, because new knowledge, which begets new products, is generated through research. There's a second benefit from increasing returns - falling costs. With a technology product, say, a new program like Windows NT, it becomes cheaper and cheaper to produce each new unit. Factoring in research costs, the first copy of Windows NT may have run Microsoft US$150 million. But each copy produced after that was essentially free.<br>

</p>

<p>
Early software pirates understood this property of software intuitively when they passed copies of WordPerfect or Lotus among friends. The reasoning was, why pay for something when it cost the company barely anything to produce? Here's where Romer ultimately runs afoul of classical theory. Old-school economics assumes that companies charge for a product exactly what it cost to manufacture or harvest the last unit. If that were the case, software firms would hand out their goods on every street corner.
</p>

<p>
But when industries have huge research costs and low production costs, they tend to evolve toward what economists call a monopoly - a situation where companies charge more for their goods than what it cost to produce the last unit. "If you forced anyone in the world of ideas to sell their product at the cost of producing the last unit, they'd go bankrupt," says Romer. His appreciation of the role monopolies plays in the economy lands Romer in the neo-Schumpeterian camp - named after Joseph Schumpeter, who almost 50 years ago recognized the importance of monopolies in capitalist societies.
</p>

<p>
Problem is, a monopoly isn't supposed to happen according to classical economics. In Ricardo's insular world, competition is perfect: many small firms compete against each other, but none is able to set prices; the cost of entry into the market is nil; and prices reflect the cost of production. But the economics of high technology shatter this convenient scheme. Because the cost of research is so steep, the price of market entry is often enormously high. As a result, big firms often slug it out, and by simultaneously trying to fund new discoveries while paying for old ones, they charge far more than the cost of production. The economics of monopolistic competition, as it has been branded, is the economics of the technology age.
</p>

<p>
But there's a big conundrum for monopolies and monopolistic societies. What price is the right price to charge for a new idea, for a new software tool? The classical notion of price-setting worked well. More often than not, demand equaled supply; and competition kept suppliers from charging more than consumers would pay. This classical understanding of pricing provided the ideological cover for market economies to flourish. For more than 200 years, laissez-faire economists have admonished kings and presidents - often bent on controlling the economy's mood swings - to simply set property rights and let the market determine prices. In effect, capitalism will take care of itself. But everyone assumed that monopolies would rarely arise. And if they did, most agreed, the government should step in. So now what?
</p>

<p>
If our goal is simply to encourage the production of new bitstreams, Romer says, prices must be set very high. But, he asks, what's the right price to make sure a new bitstream is used efficiently? "You can't overuse an idea. Anybody in the world who can benefit should be free to use it," he says. "So the right price is zero." To promote eco-nomic growth, policymakers want to encourage the development and diffusion of new ideas - what economists call "nonrival goods." They're nonrival because they can be used by everyone at the same time. Software is a nonrival good because it can be copied endlessly - at essentially no cost - and be used by many people at once. So there's a deep economic problem to solve - setting a high price to encourage research but a low price to encourage use.<br>

</p>

<p>
"The economic problem," Romer says, "is really about configuring all our institutions so that we search efficiently through this space of possible ideas, finding better and better ones." Here Romer's technological economics turns into a set of policies for the technological age. He believes that companies must derive some monopoly profits for taking the risk to develop new ideas. In fact, without the incentive of capturing such profits, he concludes, companies would not engage in research. But Romer also supports government funding for basic research and advocates revamping patent and copyright laws to limit the control companies can exe#rt over new technologies. The balance, he hopes, will provide enough incentive for companies to pursue new technologies and, at the same time, allow other individuals and companies access to the ideas that flow from research.
</p>

<p>
Romer aligns himself with Clinton administration antitrust advocates who have sought to limit the scope of some patents on the grounds that they impede innovation. He buys Borland International Inc.'s argument, for instance, that Lotus's copyright on menu commands was too broad, preventing rivals from inventing Lotus-compatible programs (see Updata, page 92). But he isn't so sure that Microsoft should be hammered by trust busters yet. "The crucial question with Microsoft," he adds, "is whether it has reached the point of stifling creativity and slowing the discovery of new ideas. I don't think that has been demonstrated yet."
</p>

<p>
More important, though, Romer warns that governments must pursue intelligent technology policies. Given his doctorate from the University of Chicago, home to Milton Friedman and free market economics, it's no surprise Romer's still a free-marketer. He opposes the kinds of handouts to industry the federal government's Advanced Technology Program has spearheaded. "You don't want pork barrel programs to get in the way of effective economic outcomes," he warns. At the same time, he believes it's vital that government supports basic research, the birthplace of ideas.
</p>

<p>
Romer suggests concentrating funds on universities, both to stimulate basic research and to create cadres of highly educated people who will fan out into the economy and generate new technologies. He is particularly disposed to the idea of bankrolling graduate students with free-floating fellowships - rather than research assistant positions - that would allow them to follow market signals and study areas where demand for their skills set is likely to be greatest. With such fellowships in place, Romer argues, we could avoid problems such as the current glut of physicists. (Federal funding has poured into physics departments to attract students, but there are precious few jobs for physicists once they graduate.) Far better, Romer says, to let students backed by fellowships choose to study something like electronic engineering, where industry demand is high.
</p>

<p>
While Romer's recommendations about technology policy remain open to stiff debate, his ideas about how economies grow have been so powerfully argued that there are few detractors. These days, the arguments are on the margins. Some economists, for instance, dispute the importance of Romer's thesis when it comes to developing countries. They hold that if poorer nations such as India manage to educate their populations and accumulate more capital, then growth will automatically follow.
</p>

<p>
Not so, Romer argues. To develop successfully, countries must be open to new ideas and capture the benefits of the latest technologies. The only logical path, he suggests, is to embrace free trade and encourage investment by large corporations. These companies will th#en bring the necessary knowledge of industrial organization, international markets, and product differentiation to allow developing nations to become truly global players. Romer's theory hints at an unexpected benefit of free trade: access to new ideas.
</p>

<p>
However this argument shakes out, Romer's place in economic thought is secure. Some even say a Nobel Prize is within reach. "He must be on many people's short list," says Solow. Romer, meanwhile, would rather that people measure his work this way: "I hope my contribution is to change the world a little bit," he says. "To help people understand the way it works." What attracted him to physics - that search for "small-t truth," as he puts it - motivates his ongoing work in economics. "There is a real world out there, and I want to get the right answers."
</p>

<p>
Equally, Romer wants the world to know that economics isn't necessarily a dismal science. Despite all the discouraging facts economists routinely dredge up, he wants people to realize "there's a little corner of economics where a sense of wonder about what is possible still exists." And the man sitting in that corner is Paul Romer.<br>
