<p>
- Impact (EV1) program started from an impulsive announcement of GM's CEO Roger Smith on Earth Day, 1990: GM would produce the concept car Impact<br>
- Smith retired immediately afterwards<br>
- Smith's announcement encouraged California regulators to build a mandate on his boast, requiring the seven largest carmakers to sell "zero-emission vehicles" in 1998<br>
- his successor, Robert Stempel, supported the program over next two years<br>
- in December 1992, the program seemed to be terminated amidst Stempel's sacking and huge losses that GM had suffered <br>
- uncertainties in costs, in the market, in technology, lack of necessary infrastructure<br>
- Only 50 Impact prototypes were ordered as learning platforms<br>
- Impact engineers then initiated secret talks with Ford and Chrysler to consider a Big Three EV consortium; this led to renewed determination by GM to do Impact on its own
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
Technically, as a growing number of automotive journalists have proclaimed, the rechristened EV1 is a rousing triumph. It is not merely the best electric car yet made; it is the best-engineered small car in General Motors's history. Whether or not it will succeed is quite another question.<br>
- will an initial market materialize for a high-priced, performance-limited EV?<br>
- will the costs decrease fast enough?<br>
- will range and recharging limitations be eased through technological advancements?<br>
- will an infrastructure of charging stations rise soon enough to make a difference?<br>
- will the government be able to help?
</p>

<p>
...
</p>

<p>
If, on the other hand, EV1 fails, it will bring more than ignominy and a multimillion-dollar write-off to a company that is just getting back on its feet. It will also mar, if not ruin, the electric vehicle market for other manufacturers, and render the very notion of EVs misbegotten, with the EV1 consigned a place beside the Edsel.<br>
...<br>
To me, it seems clear that the [California ZEV] mandate, by forcing the world's largest carmakers to start the hard R&amp;D march to electric vehicles at a time when none but GM wished to do so, has been a triumph of social policy as important to the betterment of this country in its day as the Clean Air Act was a generation ago. Quite literally, it has jumpstarted the future of automotive transportation, and in doing so shown, in an age of political selfishness and cynicism, that government can, on occasion, offer enlightened leadership. 
</p>

<p>
HOX HOX / NOTE: Government role different from offering straight R&amp;D subsidies - these would probably be allocated by companies to more lucrative short-term targets - regulation forced R&amp;D funding to long-term, more speculative projects???
</p>

</p>

<p>
- GM had had an EV project Electrovette in the late 1970s<br>
7<br>
- a converted Chevette, it ran on zinc nickel oxide batteries with a DC motor<br>
- batteries held twice the range of lead acid batteries, and a way had been found to keep zinc from deteriorating after relatively few recharges<br>
- max range was 100 miles, and ZnNi batteries cost far more than lead acid<br>
- the car also had arcing, energy loss and reliability issues, mainly because of its mechanical-electric control system<br>
- the program was dropped at the demo stage after oil prices dropped
</p>

<p>
10
</p>

<p>
- the car had to be first to the market, the first mass-produced EV of modern times; it also had to cost no more than an ordinary gas car
</p>

<p>
What Baker was being asked to do, he realized, was not unlike being asked to produce the world's first laptop computer, but also to make it, at the same time, as cheap, and as efficient, as laptops a decade down the line. 
</p>

<p>
12
</p>

<p>
- GM had produced its first electric truck in 1912
</p>

<p>
13
</p>

<p>
- early cars were suspicious because of gasoline in their tanks:<br>
"You can't get people to sit on an explosion," observed Colonel Albert Pope, the largest maker of electric cars of the late 1890s. 
</p>

<p>
- Edison was so confident of EV's potential superiority that he spend a decade and most of his fortune to a search for more effective battery elements than lead and acid<br>
- his nickel-iron pairing failed in cars, but led to NiCd batteries
</p>

<p>
In retrospect, the race was lost in 1908 when Henry Ford's Model T rolled off the first automotive assembly line at a working man's price of $850. (EVs cost around $3000)<br>
- in 1912, starter engine replaced Cadillac's crank<br>
- GM's electric truck was pulled out of produciton in 1916
</p>

<p>
16
</p>

<p>
- the Impact program hinged on Sunraycer, a solar car built for a race in Australia; this hinged on Stempel being on his office when Howard Wilson (from GM-owned Hughes Aircraft) had been first rebuffed by Lloyd Reuss
</p>

<p>
17
</p>

<p>
- inverter history: inverters that chopped DC to AC allowed the use of AC motors, which were lighter and had no brushes that would wear down<br>
- in the 1980s, inverters were large industrial equipment<br>
- a few small inverters had been attempted for electric cars, including one built by GM engineer Paul Agarwal in the 1960s for an EV called the Electrovair<br>
- the electronics then had been crude and too expensive, and Agarwal had abandoned the project<br>
- Alec Brooks of AeroVironment (a firm chosen to design Sunraycer) contacted Alan Cocconi, who he knew from CalTech
</p>

<p>
Cocconi thought he could design a DC to AC inverter light enough to Sunraycer. He thought he could make it work in reverse, too, to employ a nifty concept called regenerative braking. 
</p>

<p>
19
</p>

<p>
What AeroVironment's Alec Brooks had in mind was a sporty two-seater built from the ground up to be lighter and more nimble than any electric vehicle of the past. A car that could use a more powerful version of the solar car's inverter and AC motor, and accomodate a battery pack that had the power to propel a lifesized electric vehicle as fast or faster than a gas-powered car, as well as the energy to make it go more than 100 miles. <br>
20<br>
- Brooks hoped to bmake an EV that accelerated from 0-60 mph in 8 seconds
</p>

<p>
21
</p>

<p>
- instead of flooded lead acid batteries, which would need water replenishment in EVs, gas recombinant batteries were envisaged for the prototype<br>
- these were in fairly experimental stage, but could be packed more densely<br>
- Bob Bish, a battery expert from GM-owned Delco Remy, saw that instead of envisaged 900 pounds of batteries, only 843 pounds of flooded batteries would fit in the space allotted<br>
- Bish had to devise the densest lead acid battery in the world
</p>

<p>
- in summer 1988, the project was decided to be funded for some $3 million<br>
- deadline: 15 months
</p>

<p>
22
</p>

<p>
- Brook's goal for drag coefficient was 0.19, similar to F-16 fighter jet (average car coefficients are 0.35 to 0.4; Sunraycer had had 0.12)
</p>

<p>
23
</p>

<p>
- Cocconi would build two 50 kW inverters for the car's two motors, single 100-kW inverter was too difficult<br>
- these were essentially scaled-up Sunraycer inverters, but besides increased power, they also had to be capable of instant fluctuations of current as the car sped up or slowed down; Sunraycer had ran mostly at the cruising speed<br>
- Cocconi's final design would weigh 61 pounds
</p>

<p>
24
</p>

<p>
- in July 1989, Brooks reported to Runkle that he would need more than five months to finish the job<br>
- Roger Smith however wanted to unveil it at the L.A. auto show in early January<br>
- his colleagues were not happy: they feared it would encourage California regulators
</p>

<p>
27
</p>

<p>
MacCready [founder of AeroVironment], taking the long view, reasoned that in making electric vehicles seem real, Impact had hastened the arrival of real alternative vehicles by five years.
</p>

<p>
If GM said an electric car could be done, why, the regulators might make them do it, failing to appreciate, as usual, the difference between a proof-of-concept vehicle and a fully productionized cars
</p>

<p>
30
</p>

<p>
Runkle - and Reyss and Schultz and Stempel - had acted as if the Impact program was a little experiment in bureaucratic process. The car itself? A piece of cake. Those brainy futurists in California had already done the hard work. The car existed. It drove. The new electronics were in place. So were the new lightweight materials. And for batteries, the car used plain old, dependable lead acid. All Baker had to do was change the frame and body fro fiberglass to aluminium, throw in some heat and air-conditioning, maybe power windows and a CD player, and send it off to production. Surely it was easier than starting a new car from scratch. 
</p>

<p>
- the concept car had claimed to achieve a range of 120 miles; this was on a modified, drag-reduced version with 100% battery discharge; with more realistic settings and 80% discharge, the range was more like 70 miles - on good conditions, and with no amenities like power windows, air conditioning/heating, CD player...<br>
- the ground clearance of 5 inches would be too little for even speed bumps<br>
- GM had a minimum 8 inch clearance for all its cars - measured with two adult passengers in the car, not with car sitting empty<br>
- the concept car was not even water-proof<br>
- aluminium would also be heavier than fiberglass<br>
- crashworthiness had to be built in <br>
- the electronics of the show car had cost $100 000; required cost to come down to $20 000 and perform reliably<br>
- inverter's MOSFET switches failed every 20 hours
</p>

<p>
32
</p>

<p>
- John Williams had analyzed the concept car and attempted to determine whether it could be produced: he concluded that it could be, but whether it could be made well enough and inexpensively enough to find a market, no one could say
</p>

<p>
- Roger Smith had acted entirely on instinct, ignored the advice to test in secret, and went public with the plan to produce the Impact 
</p>

<p>
33
</p>

<p>
- the charger also had to be developed
</p>

<p>
41
</p>

<p>
- Cocconi's inverter was the first MOSFET-using inverter that was powerful enough for a car and small enough to fit into one<br>
42<br>
- a problem with MOSFET was that many parallel units (288) were required to handle the power, and if one MOSFET (metal oxide semi-conductor field effect transistor) failed (as it did every 20 hours or so), the entire inverter might be destroyed<br>
- just when a new transistor type was needed, one came along: the IGBT (insulated gate bipolar transistor) <br>
- the Japanese had begun to use them in elevators, but not much need for compact switching of high-power currents had been so far<br>
- one IGBT could handle more current than MOSFET, so fewer were needed; there were also less wires so less opportunities for failure<br>
- single IGBT at this stage replaced 24 MOSFETs; soon, it would replace 48<br>
- IGBTs had not been available for Cocconi to use in the concept car<br>
- Cocconi argued in favor of improving MOSFETs<br>
- Hughes team (chosen to build the inverter for production Impact) secretly planned for IGBT one<br>
- Cocconi got angry over this, and over Hughes's decision to use digital instead of analog computer for controller
</p>

<p>
47
</p>

<p>
- Cocconi had used the inverter for charging as well, allowing charging simply by plugging the vehicle into a wall. This was simple, but the prototype tripped ground fault interruptors of nearby wall sockets, and added some weight
</p>

<p>
48
</p>

<p>
- CARB regulators and GM's announcements:
</p>

<p>
The regulators knew EVs could be done, they added blithely, because GM had said as much. 
</p>

<p>
49
</p>

<p>
That [Sam] Leonard [director of environmental activities for GM] should appear before CARB this time and meekly endorse what would soon be known simply as The Mandate was not, in truth, a sign of new faith on his part in the efficacy of environmental regulation.<br>
- Leonard was Ayn Rand believer<br>
- he had no choice: his own company had said EVs could be done<br>
- CARB had made two concessions in return: cleaner gas had been mandated along cleaner cars; Leonard believed this would keep other states from following California's lead; CARB would also hold biannual technical review of EV progress to see if EVs were evolving fast enough to justify keeping the mandate in place
</p>

<p>
Based on two decades of experience, Leonard thought the chances of EV R&amp;D conforming to CARB's schedule were absolutely nil. <br>
...<br>
Leonard admitted the car companies had fought new clean-air standards time and again, claimed they couldn't meet them - emissions impossible - only to meet them after all. But the car companies hadn't met them, he would point out, not when the regulators ruled they must. The technology hadn't been there. And so deadlines had been missed, compromises reached, until the carmakers had inched into compliance - pretty much when they'd said they could. 
</p>

<p>
50
</p>

<p>
"Ninety-three was the first model year we ever built a model certified to seventy-five standards." (Leonard)
</p>

<p>
55
</p>

<p>
Much later, Robert Stempel would bridle at the suggestion that the mandate had been, on balance, a bold and wise move. The mandate, he would say, was a mistake, brought on by GM's error in going public with the Impact. 
</p>

<p>
57
</p>

<p>
- LA drivers had to endure long commutes; they would want all the amenities they could buy. CD players and air-conditioning were necessary
</p>

<p>
When the hypothetical premium rose to more than $5000, all but the richest "early adopters" fell away. 
</p>

<p>
58
</p>

<p>
- GM had produced three 2-door sports cars in he past: Allante, Fiero, and Reatta. All had failed<br>
- in GM's California market, only 4 models accounted for more than 2% of 280 000 cars sold each year: 3 of them sold for under $20 000 each, far less than any first-time EV would cost
</p>

<p>
60
</p>

<p>
- production Impact was to have one engine only: two engines required two sets of gears, and posed a safety problem if one of them failed
</p>

<p>
61
</p>

<p>
- aluminium frame: GM had toyed with an aluminium-frame Corvette in 1972, and in mid-80s it had turned out Al concept versions of each year's Fiero<br>
- however, weight saved was of little consequence with gasoline so plentiful<br>
- Al was tricky stuff: Impact chiefs thought this might be their greatest design challenge, more even than the propulsion system
</p>

<p>
62
</p>

<p>
- Impact might use an adhesive in its frame<br>
- also extrusion parts<br>
- in Impact, the normal process where all the other parts were designed first and frame last was reversed
</p>

<p>
64
</p>

<p>
- the Impact could not make return on investment; only 2nd and 3rd generation vehicles might do so
</p>

<p>
68
</p>

<p>
- used electric brakes for rear wheels: these would be balanced with regen braking and hydraulic backup in front wheels, but no one had done that before
</p>

<p>
TECHNOLOGIES<br>
- small, lightweight inverter<br>
- dense batteries (gas recombinant)<br>
- the charger<br>
(- lightweight construction; aluminum construction, improvements)<br>
- electric brakes
</p>

<p>
84-88
</p>

<p>
- other car manufacturers (Chrysler and Ford) had more limited programs. Chrysler, the smallest of the Big Three and recently nearly bankrupt, planned to meet ZEV mandate by buying parts from suppliers and simply bolting them on to its minivans; this would suffice to produce the very limited number of ZEVs that Chrysler's 1998 sales would require. Ford was planning a conversion of its European Escort van, the Ecostar. The plan was to build 105 prototype vans, with eighty of them to be leased to utilities at about $100 000 each for 30 months. This would defray at best 10% of the program's estimated $80 million of R&amp;D costs. The idea was to minimize the early phase costs with prototypes and learn from new technology, in order to implement it when the time was right. 
</p>

<p>
85
</p>

<p>
- Aside from metal body, Ecostar was a "ground-up" design featuring low rolling resistance tires, new suspension and chassis, regen braking, different climate control and different steering; these were in anyway required when the engine was removed and battery pack installed
</p>

<p>
86
</p>

<p>
- with lead-acid batteries, the Ecostar would have a range of only 20 miles; with developmental sodium sulfur batteries, the range might be extended to 60 miles; however. NaS batteries required constant heating (or cooling) to keep them liquid
</p>

<p>
95
</p>

<p>
- there was always the danger that the ZEV mandate might be met with cheap EV conversion, and the ground-up EV program killed to save costs HOX HOX! Companies can work their way around difficult regulations in a way that does very little to advance technological progress
</p>

<p>
- the adoption of California's ZEV mandate by nine Northeastern states in October 1991 was both a blessing and a curse for GM: it increased the market, but the EV was not ready for cold climates
</p>
