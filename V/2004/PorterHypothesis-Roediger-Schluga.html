Roediger-Schluga (2004): The Porter Hypothesis and the Economic Consequences of Environmental Regulation
</p>

<br>

<p>
<ol type="1" start="2">
<li>The Porter Hypothesis: Environmental Regulation, Innovation and Competitiveness</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
2.1 The Porter Hypothesis Revisited
</p>

<p>
What are the techno-economic consequences of environmental regulation? Until quite recently, the answer to this question seemed straightforward.<br>
- firms pollute because the prevailing price system does not fully reflect the<br>
18<br>
social costs of their productive activities<br>
- in order to move closer to a social optimum, environmental regulation imposes a constraint which induces firms to adjust their production patterns in a way that is more desirable for society<br>
- assuming profit maximising behavior, the addition (or the tightening) of a constraint on a firm’s set of choices increases production costs, both directly through expenditures for pollution reduction and indirectly through higher factor prices<br>
- in response, firms may either reduce output and/or invest in R&amp;D to find cheaper ways of conducting the regulated activity, that is, attempt to innovate
</p>

<p>
19
</p>

<p>
Firms may benefit in two ways from environmental regulation. First, by being forced to try harder, firms may discover ways to reduce their production costs through increased “resource efficiency” since pollution is frequently “a form of economic waste” (Porter and van der Linde 1995).<br>
20<br>
…<br>
Second, environmental regulation may increase turnover and profits through creating markets for cleaner products, processes and services. This effect may be reinforced by a first-mover advantage if other countries or regions subsequently introduce similar regulation. 
</p>

<p>
2.2 Theoretical explanations
</p>

<p>
- Porter failed to come up with a more elaborate theoretical justification for the argument<br>
One set of explanations focuses on the existence of a positive externality to environmental R&amp;D. In a trade model, Brander and Taylor (1997) show that environmental regulation may increase average productivity and thus by implication competitiveness, if it improves the productivity of a factor input through clean air, clean water, improved health and so on. 
</p>

<p>
Xepapadeas and de Zeeuw (1999) show that environmental regulation may give rise to a modernisation of a firm’s capital stock and induce downsizing, that is, the reduction of total capital stock. 
</p>

<p>
21
</p>

<p>
- Gabel and Sinclaire-Desgagné (1999) expound the “inability to perceive” argument; they start with the observation that managers have limited attention spans, information flows between management and employees tend to be imperfect and employees work according to their own objectives; to economise on the time required for each single decision, firms have standard operating procedures (SOPs) and routines<br>
- these are designed to minimise operating costs and allow work to proceed much more quickly and efficiently<br>
- refining or replacing SOPs is costly<br>
- therefore, SOPs are a source of rigidity and organisational failure<br>
- changing SOPs difficult: (1) changes often require complementary changes in other parts of the system, (2) changes need to take place in a coordinated manner, and (3) SOPs may be a source of inertia and hence resistant to change. 
</p>

<p>
26
</p>

<p>
- Boyd and McCelland (1999) and Boyd and Pang (2000) use data envelopment analysis to evaluate the potential for win-win improvements in the paper and glass industry, showing that the paper indstry could cut average pollution and input intensity by 2 to 8 per cent. However, they also find evidence that abatement capital spending lowers productivity by crowding out other, more productive investment and that overall environmental constraints lower potential productivity, accounting for about two-thirds of the observed inefficiencies. 
</p>

<br>

<p>
28
</p>

<p>
Regarding the impact of environmental regulation on innovation, Lanjouw and Mody (1996) analyse the impact of increased environmental compliance costs on patenting of environmental technologies, using international data on compliance expenditures and environmental patents. They find that increases in compliance costs lead to increases in patenting of environmental technologies with a one- to two-year lag. Taking a broader view, Jaffe and Palmer (1997) examine the impact of environmental compliance expenditures on R&amp;D expenditures and the total number of successful patent applications<br>
- find that environmental compliance expenditures had a significant positive effect on R&amp;D expenditures, but no impact on overall patenting<br>
Brunnermeier and Cohen (2003) investigate how changes in pollution abatement expenditures and increased monitoring and enforcement activities affected environmental patenting in US manufacturing during the period 1983-92. They find that ceteris paribus higher environmental abatement expenditures induced a small, but statistically significant increase in environmental patenting. They do not, however, find evidence that an increase in monitoring efforts motivates innovation. Finally, industries exposed to more foreign competition tend to have more environmental patents, which is consistent with the notion that foreign demand for cleaner artefacts spurs innovation. <br>
- these studies do not produce evidence that environmental regulation has a positive (or for that matter any) impact on total innovative activity
</p>

<p>
WHY IS IT SO HARD TO FIND EVIDENCE FOR INNOVATION?
</p>

<br>

<p>
53
</p>

<p>
3.5 Technological compliance options
</p>

<p>
- substitution of component parts<br>
- different product formulations<br>
- changes in application technology<br>
- installation of add-on equipment<br>
- etc.
</p>

<p>
From a strategic waste management perspective, pollution abatement options are — in order of desirability — (a) the total elimination of a pollutant, (b) a reduction of the use and emission of a pollutant, (c) the recovery and recycling of a pollutant, (d) the treatment of a waste stream to remove the pollutant or reduce its impact, and (e) the appropriate disposal of residues (see, for example, Ollerenshaw 1994, p. 448).

<li>Some Stylised Facts on Technological Advance</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
- discussion in the book from the perspective of the neo-Schumpeterian or evolutionary literature on innovation and technological change<br>
- theoretical approach chosen because the author feels it to be most appropriate for the questions raised in the book
</p>

<p>
- rich neoclassical literature on innovation exists; see e.g. Kamien and Schwartz 1982; Stoneman 1983<br>
- in the neoclassical framework, innovation is an exogenous event that shifts production functions<br>
- e.g. relative changes in factor prices impact the composition of factor inputs, which is particularly important in the case of environmental innovations (see e.g. Newell et al. 1999)<br>
- however, product innovations hard to put into this framework<br>
- qualitative change that has no immediate impact on prices and costs cannot be represented (Coombs et al. 1987:28-29)<br>
- tells us little about the why and nothing about the how of technological change (Rosenberg 1976:63)<br>
82<br>
- therefore, neo-Schumpeterian perspective more useful
</p>

<p>
technological innovation has been characterised as a<br>
- purposeful search process (Nelson and Winter 1982)<br>
- problem solving activity, meeting at the same time some cost and marketability requirements (Dosi 1988:1125)
</p>

<p>
83
</p>

<p>
Technological advance… remains an experimental search process in the face of considerable uncertainty and ignorance in which trial after trial yields a gradual improvement in understanding (Vicenti 1990)
</p>

<p>
- in the R&amp;D process, new knowledge is produced or existing knowledge is combined in novel ways and transformed into economically meaningful products or processes (Edquist 1997)
</p>

<p>
- a model of this process: “chain-linked” model of how firms innovate (Kline and Rosenberg 1986)<br>
- technological practice may sometimes precede science and stimulate the search for a scientific explanation (Rosenberg 1982:144)
</p>

<p>
84
</p>

<p>
- “initiating” and “analytic” design: initiating design reflects invention, analytic is a routine engineering task in which various arrangements of existing components are analysed, or designs already within the state of the art are modified so as to accomplish new tasks or perform old tasks more efficiently (Kline and Rosenberg 1986:292)
</p>

<p>
85
</p>

<p>
- a study of 45 firms in the American environmental technology industry found that the average time for bringing an environmental technology to marketability was 3.5 years (ELI 1997:5)
</p>

<p>
- length of phase-in period affects development costs, but also determines the quality of possible compliance responses:<br>
As new technology has to be designed, developed, tested, manufactured and sold, too brief a phase-in period may inhibit sizeable technological advance. Instead of developing more efficient process-integrated pollution control measures, firms may opt for “tried and tested” end-of-pipe solutions (Clayton et al. 1999b:227-30)
</p>

<p>
- sources of external knowledge for firms looking for new technology:<br>
Large-scale innovation surveys such as the Yale questionnaire in the US (Levin et al. 1987) and the European CIS (see CORDIS 2002) and PACE (see Arundel et al. 1995) innovation surveys show that at an aggregate level, technical analysis of rival products (reverse engineering) is the most important source of external knowledge, followed by knowledge gathered from independent suppliers, affiliated firms and independent customers. However, there are wide variations across industries. For example, suppliers are the most important source of knowledge in the automobile industry, but least important in pharmaceuticals (Arundel et al. 1995).
</p>

<p>
100
</p>

<p>
- fairly stable pattern of technological process: evolutionary process punctuated by discontinuous change (Anderson and Tushman 1990)<br>
- new, radical artefacts are rarely fully developed when entering their commercial lives (Rosenberg 1982; Clark 1985; Sahal 1985; Kline and Rosenberg 1986; Anderson and Tushman 1990)<br>
- technological ferment or experimentation: triggered by technological breakthroughs; alternative designs are introduced, both because the technology is not well understood and its ultimate, optimal shape is not yet clear, and because pioneering firms have an incentive to differentiate their new products (Anderson and Tushman 1990:612)<br>
- at this stage, innovation efforts focused on improving the performance of the new and establishing their superiority over older and competing designs<br>
- dominant designs: incorporate well-tested and robust features which promise high reliability. Tend to lag behind the technological possibility frontier, as state-of-the-art design is typically experimental and hence too unreliable and risky for the majority of adopters (Anderson and Tushman 1990:616-17)<br>
- Anderson and Tushman (1990:614) suggest restricting the term “dominant design” to design configurations that attain a market share in excess of 50%
</p>

<p>
104
</p>

<p>
The model by Anderson and Tushman appears particularly well suited to those technologies where economies of scale and learning curve effects are paramount. This is appropriate for fairly homogenous markets where customers have similar preferences. If markets are highly fragmented, the penalty on multiple designs is likely to be much smaller and likely to be offset by the ability to better cater to customer needs (Teece 1986). Also, dominant designs may fail to emerge if the competition process between rival design configurations is artificially forestalled. This may happen in regimes of high appropriability where innovators are able to appropriate most of the returns from innovation, and imitation is more or less ruled out. In these instances, the emergence of a dominant design is a matter of strategic choice for the innovator (Anderson and Tushman 1990). 
</p>

<p>
106
</p>

<p>
Several further important concepts have been proposed to account for the highly selective and focused nature of “normal” technological advance. Nelson and Winter (1977) have coined the term “natural trajectories”, by which they refer to trajectories of technological advance common to many technologies that exist under a wide range of demand and cost conditions. Examples include automation, changes in the scale of production, improvement of process yields, input materials and product characteristics, and design for market segments (Cohen 1995:220). <br>
…<br>
Another widely observed pattern is the up- or down-scaling of artefacts, especially in mechanical technologies. A change in the size of a system is generally accompanied by differential growth of its components in relation to the whole, change in the materials of construction and increase in the complexity of its structure. If an artefact can no longer be scaled up or down, a new artefact must be developed which opens up new “innovation avenues” (Sahal 1985).<br>
The key idea of these concepts is that technological advance appears to follow an internal logic and is not fine tuned to changing demand and cost conditions. Rosenberg (1976) speaks of “technological imperatives” that guide the evolution of certain technologies. Technological innovation takes place and evolves within the technological and commercial context of existing products and production processes. As connected technologies are improved, bottlenecks and obvious weak spots occur. These “technical imbalances” form clear, almost inevitable targets for improvement which dictate exploratory activity in particular directions. 
</p>

<p>
107
</p>

<p>
- observations such as imbalances and interdependencies somewhat modify the simple conceptualization of technological advance implied by the “induced-innovation hypothesis”:<br>
According to this hypothesis, firms can freely choose between different combinations of input factors in response to changes in environmental conditions. However, if one thinks in terms of specific design configurations, substituting one combination of inputs for another implies the choice between different design configurations with their specific economic and technical trade-offs. Therefore, to the extent that existing design configurations can be adapted or new variants developed, technology is malleable and able to respond to changes in environmental conditions. Many relationships, however, are given and cannot be altered incrementally. <br>
In the extreme case, such technological constraints may almost preclude an adaptation to changing environmental conditions. For example, between September 1972 and September 1976, the price of the three most important primary raw materials — naphta, ethylene and propylene — more than quadrupled (Dohnke 2000:102), which affected almost the complete range of inputs. Naturally, firms vigorously started to search for alternatives that would decrease their dependence on fickle oil prices. However, it has proved enormously difficult to substitute petroleum-based components, whcih still account for more than 80 per cent of the raw materials in coatings (Dohnke 2000:115). Another example is TiO2, by far the most important pigment used for paints and coatings. During the last two decades, prices have fluctuated widely (see, for example, EUROSTAT 1993, p. 6-23). Despite rising<br>
108<br>
input prices, coatings manufacturers have not come up with a viable alternative. <br>
Naturally, these are extreme examples that do not rule out the possibility of induced innovation in many cases. Indeed, the importance of “inducement mechanisms” or “focusing devices” (Rosenberg 1976) which focus search in a particular direction has also been acknowledged by the neo-Schumpeterian literature on innovation and technological change. Several important mechanisms have been identified, the two most important of which in the present context are (environmental) product and process regulations and the sudden unavailability of an accustomed source of supply. For instance, the scarcity and unavailability of traditional raw materials for paints and coatings greatly stimulated the search for new, synthetic inputs in Germany during the 1930s and especially during World War II (Dohnke 2000). Similarly, in a sophisticated econometric study on the evolution of the energy efficiency of the menu of home appliances available for sale in the US between 1958 and 1993, Newell et al. (1999) find that about half of the change can be attributed to changes in energy prices and energy efficiency standards. The other half, however, is due to autonomous factors which highlights the existence and relevance of technological constraints.

<p>
- the distribution of returns from innovations is typically highly skewed and can best be approximated by a log-normal distribution (Scherer et al. 2000)
</p>

<p>
112
</p>

<p>
In a study on how quickly firms learn about what their rivals have in their R&amp;D pipeline, Mansfield (1985) found that information about a firm’s R&amp;D projects leaks out after 18 months at the latest.
</p>

<p>
114
</p>

<p>
- time between the first consideration of a process-integrated pollution abatement measure and its implementation in the German chemical industry: 8-10 years (Faber et al. 1994:60)<br>
- average time to discover and develop a new drug: around 15 years (Mahlich and Roediger-Schluga 2002)<br>
- long-term performance tests for new corrosion protection coatings may take up to 15 years
</p>

<p>
The discussion on technological uncertainty may have important implications for the relationship between environmental regulation and innovation, since it shows that not all types of technological advance are equally uncertain. <br>
115<br>
While change within existing design configurations is fairly certain, the development of new design configurations is entirely unpredictable. Bottlenecks in existing design configurations are public knowledge, as are potential solutions. Indeed, firms may already have some prototypes in their R&amp;D labs, which may be nearly marketable. Importantly, this is not meant to insinuate that it may not be extremely difficult or expensive to make any of these solutions actually work. It merely suggests that different types of technological advance are predictable to different degrees which may play an important role in the determination of pollution abatement targets. 
</p>

<p>
116
</p>

<p>
- although technologies are malleable, they are nowhere as malleable as to fit standard microeconomic models<br>
Thus, if environmental considerations dictate certain performance characteristics of a technology, there is a very good chance that these will be met at some point in the future. However, when this will be and how these requirements will be achieved cannot be predicted with certainty.

<li>Determinants and Adoption of Cleaner Technological Innovations</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
- what decides whether a firm devotes scarce resources to the search for innovations? It expects to earn a satisfactory return on investment.<br>
- what decides whether innovation efforts are successful? That’s difficult to answer
</p>

<p>
- at industry level, two necessary conditions are technological opportunity and market demand (Mowery and Rosenberg 1979)<br>
- profit-oriented firm must also be able to appropriate at least some of the rent stream generated by an innovation
</p>

<p>
Firm-specific factors:<br>
- new technology needs to be adopted in the marketplace
</p>

<p>
118
</p>

<p>
5.1. Technological Opportunity<br>
- denotes the opportunity for technological advance in any particular field of technological knowledge<br>
- from an economic perspective, can be conceptualized as the cost of achieving some normalised unit of technological advance in a given industry (Cohen and Levinthal 1990:139)
</p>

<p>
Technological opportunity depends on the amount of valuable technological and scientific knowledge available for commercial exploitation at any point of time. Such knowledge may originate from a firm’s internal R&amp;D or from external sources,  that is, other firms’ R&amp;D activities or public research organisations like universities or research laboratories. So as to be commercially valuable , it has to complement and enhance existing knowledge within firms. <br>
- widely accepted fact: technological opportunity unequally distributed across industries and over time; empirical evidence in Cohen (1995)<br>
- two sources of variance identified: differing closeness to science and the maturity of the technological paradigm in which an industry operates (Levin et al. 1985)<br>
- new technological paradigms have often depended on and been directly linked to major scientific breakthroughs, such as the development of synthetic chemistry, the transistor or bioengineering (Dosi 1988)
</p>

<p>
Over time, the type of scientific knowledge required is likely to differ. Early on in the development of a new technology, knowledge is required about how the different components of a design configuration interact and how the system will perform as a whole. Later, research is more likely to address problems occurring in the production of individual component parts (Kline and Rosenberg 1986:291-92). Therefore, different types of scientific knowledge are required at different stages of the innovation process (Kline and Rosenberg 1986:295)
</p>

<p>
119
</p>

<p>
- technological opportunity may be affected by the maturity of a technological paradigm: at the early stages of search, opportunities for advance likely to be plentiful, but diminish as area becomes better explored
</p>

<br>

<p>
- technological opportunity in environmental technologies:<br>
- on one hand, reason for optimism as environmental impact mitigation is relatively recent performance requirement, so there should be considerable scope for new discoveries<br>
- on the other hand, finding satisfactory preventive technologies may be difficult (Hartje and Lurie 1985):<br>
In order to substitute a “dirty” technology, a preventive technology must reduce pollution and it must accomplish the task of the old technology equally well. In other words, technical and environmental performance requirements need to be co-optimized (Kemp et al. 2000). However, the set of techniques which is acceptable both in technological and environmental terms is only a subset of the set of efficient transformation techniques (that is, the techniques that perform well in technological terms). Therefore, if innovation is a random event, the chance of finding an acceptable preventive technique is likely to be (much) smaller than finding an efficient new transformation technique, which in itself is no easy task. In contrast, the chance of finding a feasible end-of-pipe (EOP) pollution abatement technique is likely to be greater, as the union of the set of efficient EOP techniques with the set of efficient transformation techniques is likely to exceed the set of efficient preventive techniques. Hence, it may be simpler to find an acceptable EOP solution than a preventive solution, which is one reason that might explain the prevalence of EOP pollution control measures.
</p>

<p>
120
</p>

<p>
5.2 Market Demand
</p>

<p>
- firms will only invest in R&amp;D if they expect to find markets for the resulting new artefacts<br>
- greater the perceived market potential, the more a firm will be ready to spend on it<br>
- however, given the time lag (innovation developed now will be commercialised later) the notion of market demand is quite tricky!
</p>

<p>
- FIRST: the only kind of demand that matters for innovation is effective demand, i.e. demand for some new artefact at a price that covers production and distribution costs<br>
- even if potential demand for the same artefact at a lower price would be much greater, it does not matter if the artefact cannot be produced and distributed at this price<br>
- SECOND: how can there be effective demand for something that does not exist yet?<br>
- empirical studies (Mowery and Rosenberg 1979:141; Freeman 1994:479-80) have shown that demand is much more prominent in the case of relatively minor innovations along established trajectories than in the case of substantial improvements. <br>
- the reason is because radical innovations may actually precede the existence of markets and demand curves of the kind usually employed by economists (Teubal 1979:266)<br>
- performance criteria typically vague and little understood<br>
- demand changes as given products and technologies evolve over time<br>
As experience with the new artefacts accumulates, users learn what they actually want or need (Teubal 1979:275) and revealed demand becomes much more focused and precise, which leads to growing market segmentation.<br>
- manufacturers may have to educate customers about the proper usage of new artefacts (see Green 1992)
</p>

<p>
122
</p>

<p>
Which factors prompt firms to demand cleaner products and processes? Empirical investigations have unearthed the following list of interrelated factors that may be sources of environmental pressure on firms (for example Rice 1988; Williams et al. 1993; Henriques and Sadorsky 1996):
</p>

<p>
- stringent environmental legislation and enforcement<br>
- costs of pollution control, waste disposal and effluent disposal, including the costs of training and occupational safety measures as well as reporting requirements<br>
- commercial pressure along the value chain due to the previous reasons<br>
- investors’ awareness of the firms’ environmental performance for fear of future clean-up costs (e.g. asbestos)<br>
- pressure from the local community where the polluting activity is located<br>
- pressure from the polluting firm’s workforce
</p>

<p>
124
</p>

<p>
According to standard economic theory, firms maximize profits and hence do not derive utility from better environmental policy per se, only to the extent that it impacts their profitability. In contrast, consumers may genuinely value environmental quality. If superior environmental quality is readily observable, consumers may be willing to pay more or accept a slightly lower performance <br>
HOX HOX: But firms are composed of “consumers” and they may also genuinely value environmental quality; thus firms may accept less than maximal profits if the competition remains imperfect.
</p>

<p>
- firms may be willing to invest substantial sums to fend off what they perceive as arbitrary intrusions into their sphere, such as environmental regulation that is perceived as a mere nuisance for which the firms perceive no demand among their customers. They may challenge them in courts, for example (Wallace 1995)
</p>

<p>
126
</p>

<p>
- both demand and supply factors are necessary conditions for innovation<br>
- firms will not bother to develop new paints, coatings, printing inks and adhesives unless there is clear demand or they see a chance to capture new markets<br>
- however, these attempts will fail unless new inputs, above all new resins and additives, become available<br>
This is precisely what the notion of “technological opportunity” stands for: technological innovation will occur if and only if it is technologically within reach, regardless of how desirable it may be. <br>
HOX HOX: this suggests a potential problem with regulations: the logic is that if regulation makes it more costly to pollute, it is assumed that this cost causes firms that are affected to feedback to the input manufacturers, who then are pressured to develop new inputs. But if benefits from these new inputs cannot be appropriated, for example, the input producers may not have the incentive to develop them.<br>
POTENTIAL FOR FOLLOW-UP?
</p>

<p>
129
</p>

<p>
5.3 Appropriability
</p>

<p>
- defined as those properties of technical knowledge, markets and legal environment which permit innovators to capture the benefits from innovation (von Hippel 1988:95; Dosi 1988:1139)
</p>

<p>
130
</p>

<p>
- knowledge has to be codified in order to be transmitted (Arrow 1974)<br>
- only knowledge which can be converted into information can flow between actors<br>
- the ease of transmission of any piece of knowledge depends on the nature of its code<br>
- little knowledge is genuinely tacit in the sense of being uncodifiable<br>
- given appropriate incentives, the larger part of currently uncodified knowledge can be codified and articulated (Cowan et al. 2000)<br>
- as long as there is no code or the code is only known to a small circle of users, other users can be excluded from accessing it<br>
- unlikely to be maintainable against strong countervailing incentives<br>
- Saviotti (1988) describes a life-cycle of scientific knowledge; in a similar manner, knowledge undergoes a process of codification, in which the code gradually becomes known to an ever larger number of user communities<br>
- such knowledge can only be appropriated for some time<br>
- to appropriate indefinitely, the code needs to be consistently altered<br>
The required speed of change is positively correlated to the value of the knowledge and negatively correlated to the costs of acquiring the code. Because acquiring code is costly and time consuming, a strategy of advancing the knowledge frontier may be a successful way of preventing other users from accessing the most valuable pieces of knowledge. 
</p>

<p>
- Levin et al. (1987)  (Yale survey) found that patenting is less important than new processes, learning curve effects and lead time, as well as secrecy and marketing advantages<br>
131<br>
and Arundel et al. (1995) found that patents are relatively more effective for protecting new products than new processes, but for both categories less effective than lead time, learning curve effects and marketing advantages. Secrecy is much more effective in protecting new processes than new products. For new products, patents and lead time advantages are equally the most important form of protection, followed by secrecy, technical complexity and frequent design improvement. For new processes, secrecy is the most important protection mechanism, followed by patents, technical complexity and lead time advantages, which are all almost equally important. 
</p>

<p>
- empirical research shows that both time and cost required for imitating existing products can be considerable (Mansfield et al. 1981 and Levin et al. 1987): on average, the ratio of imitation costs (time) to innovation costs (time) lie both in the range of 0.5 to 0.75, although considerable variations prevail. Indeed, in some cases, the respective ratios even exceed 1 (most particularly for major innovations)
</p>

<p>
133
</p>

<p>
- finds tentative evidence that when protecting cleaner artefacts compared to conventional artefacts,<br>
- lead time more important for cleaner<br>
- technical complexity more important for cleaner<br>
- trademarks more important for conventional (perhaps because conv. artefacts more mature and less complex than cleaner; easier to copy)

<p>
5.5 The Diffusion of Environmental Innovations
</p>

<p>
- two stylized facts: <br>
1) innovation process does not stop with the diffusion of a new or improved artefact; artefacts undergo continuous, incremental post-innovation improvements which may totally transform their economic significance (Kline and Rosenberg 1986)<br>
- difficult to draw line between an innovation and a diffusion stage and the two should rather be regarded as part of a single process (Fischer 1998)<br>
- still useful to distinguish the first commercialisation and subsequent diffusion<br>
2) diffusion processes take time, often many years (Griliches 1957, Mansfield 1963, Gold et al. 1970, Mansfield 1989)
</p>

<p>
factors affecting the diffusion of cleaner technology:<br>
- agents must know about it<br>
- adopting must be profitable
</p>

<p>
- given that artefact is new, the adopter will also have to learn about whether <br>
- it works<br>
- it is superior to available alternatives<br>
- there is a supply infrastructure available<br>
etc.
</p>

<p>
Learning about innovations is far from straightforward<br>
- with respect to cleaner technologies, empirical studies regularly find potential users, especially small firms, to be relatively poorly informed (Georg et al. 1992:538, Kemp et al. 1992, ELI 1998)
</p>

<p>
140
</p>

<p>
- examples where profitable cleaner technologies not adopted for lack of knowledge: Ayres 1994, OTA 1994
</p>

<p>
Simply knowing that a new technology exists is insufficient. By definition, innovations are new and hence not fully proven technology, which makes adoption a risky task. Adopters will therefore want some assurance that a new technology is indeed superior. Note that a new technology need not necessarily be absolutely superior to existing technology. New technologies may perform considerably worse in one dimension but more than make up for it by improvements in other dimensions. <br>
- examples: emergence of cellulose-based coatings: inferior to oil-based coatings in terms of covering strength and surface requirements, application was much faster and the time required for coating a car could therefore be cut from a couple of weeks to a mere 15 hours.
</p>

<p>
- many environmental technologies fail to match conventional techs in terms of performance characteristics<br>
- but many also suffer from teething troubles, and early failures tend to be widely remembered<br>
- e.g. the introduction of waterborne architectural coatings in Austria in the late 1980s produced disastrous results due to technological shortcomings and inappropriate application; even though these problems have been solved, early mishaps are still widely remembered by carpenters and painters (Keiler 1999)
</p>

<p>
141
</p>

<p>
- frequently, performance characteristics of new technologies may not be readily observable<br>
- long-term reliability a major issue:<br>
A major impediment to the adoption of new technology is the uncertainty as to whether it will allow downstream customers to guarantee standard warranty periods. Fearing liability claims, firms may prefer technologically inferior, but tried and tested components. 
</p>

<p>
- standard payback period in the German chemical industry is  4 years - precludes adoption of many profitable environmental innovations (Faber et al. 1994:60)
</p>

<p>
142
</p>

<p>
- adopting new technology may involve substantial opportunity costs if existing technology has to be discarded before reaching the end of its useful life, especially if old capital cannot be sold in a secondary market and hence represents sunk costs<br>
E.g. a major obstacle to the diffusion of powder coatings has been the fact that coating powders cannot be applied with conventional equipment which also cannot be refitted but needs to be completely replaced. 
</p>

<p>
- pre-emption and displacement effects: <br>
- pre-emption effect refers to a situation where a new artefact complements the existing activities of some agents more tahn it does for others, inducing the more favoured firms to move first<br>
- displacement effect refers to a new artefact cannibalising some of a firm’s existing activities, thereby making adoption more costly than it would be in the absence of such activities (Tirole 1988, chapter 10)<br>
- e.g. if users of adhesives have installed a solvent recovery or a recycling system, they no longer have any incentive to switch to alternative systems (Kirschner 1992, Anonymous 1997b) 
</p>

<p>
- another set of switching costs arises because adopters have to learn how use the new artefacts to their full potential<br>
- adopters need a capability to use (Dosi 1988:1133)
</p>

<p>
- benefits of adoption may depend on the number of users
</p>

<p>
142
</p>

<p>
- cost-benefit ratio determining the attractiveness of a new artefact as a critical threshold; see David 1975, Davies 1979<br>
- if such threshold exists, post-innovation improvements may lower it<br>
- i.e. post-innovation improvements have a market-widening effect<br>
- this underlines the crucial role of suppliers: their product, pricing and information policies determine how quickly and how widely an artefact is diffused.<br>
- but post-innovation improvements may also reduce the speed of diffusion: expectations of future technological advance (Rosenberg 1982) may cause farsighted agents to put off their adoption decisions to a later date, e.g. in the PC market<br>
- van Soest and Bulte 2001 have cast the argument in a real-option framework to explain the seemingly irrational behavior of firms that do not adopt potentiall cost-saving environmental technology
</p>

<p>
This discussion enables a re-evaluation of the puzzle why firms frequently adopt EOP pollution control technologies, even though these are necessarily cost-increasing, and do not opt for process-integrated measures that promise much greater benefits. Part of the explanation may be that firms indeed do not know or do not want to know about preventive measures. Regarding incentive problems, a recent study (OTA 1994,pp. 246-47) has found the following incentive problems inhibit the adoption of pollution prevention measures<br>
- Most plant managers are rewarded for getting the product out of the door and not for reducing waste. As a consequence, they may oppose preventive measures for fear of diverting scarce resources from production.<br>
- Production supervisors may fear that pollution prevention negatively affects product quality or disrupts production processes.<br>
- Engineers may see prevention as diverting them from more interesting and valued work.<br>
- Production line workers may not be rewarded for initiating prevention solutions.<br>
- Buyer specifications may require the use of certain processes, making shifts to pollution prevention difficult. 
</p>

<p>
144
</p>

<p>
Pollution prevention projects generally offer low potential rewards. If they succeed, business continues as usual, whereas in the case of failure, managers may get into trouble. 
</p>

<p>
- regulation important: without a regulatory requirement, firms may even be reluctant to collect environmental information as it may be used by regulators against them to assess fines and penalties (ELI 1999)<br>
- many firms simply unaware of pollution prevention opportunities or their relative merits over EOP solutions (OTA 1994:246)<br>
- existing SOPs and routines may be a source of myopia<br>
- efficiency-enhancing measures tend to occur along the path of existing technological trajectories which reinforces existing production routines<br>
- true ex ante value of R&amp;D cannot be assessed, hampering investment to it<br>
- as a consequence, inefficiencies may prevail - standard result in engineering studies (Ayres 1994)
</p>

<p>
Apart from informational and incentive problems afflicting the adoption of preventive pollution control technology, there may also be economic factors that speak in favour of EOP technologies (Hartje and Lurie 1985):<br>
- EOP technologies are simpler to develop (the set of techniques which reduces pollution while accomplishing the task is smaller than the set of techniques that merely need to accomplish the task)<br>
- EOP technologies do not interfere with existing processes (can be attached to mfg process without changing its design configuration)<br>
145<br>
- EOP technologies have a larger market (EOP technologies are usually pollutant-specific, whereas process integrated cleaner technologies are usually industry- or process-specific)<br>
- EOP technologies are less risky (1. average size of investment tends to be lower than complete overhaul of the production process; 2. sales risk for process-integrated technology is higher because of fewer buyers)<br>
- EOP technologies may be favoured by the regulatory regime (perating licenses may depend on pollution control measures implemented before startup; unless performance of process-integrated technology is demonstrated, may be difficult to get permits, and demonstrating is expensive)<br>
- EOP technologies may be favoured by the tax regime<br>
- EOP technologies require less knowledge of local conditions (simple, standardized EOP measures frequently favoured in MNCs - Clayton et al. 1999b, p. 252)
</p>

<p>
146
</p>

<p>
- EOP measures are likely to dominate whenever they are technologically feasible, even though economically they are less desirable than preventive pollution abatement measures
</p>

<br>

<p>
176
</p>

<p>
- in light of properties of technological advance (technological changes are possible but may take considerable time; rate and direction of technological advance is uncertain; while most firms are able to create minor innovations, more radical innovations are difficult), politicians can be only reasonably certain that firms are able to comply with an environmental regulation and that compliance does not have salient adverse consequences on the existing industrial order if compliance is technically attainable with existing technology (e.g. BAT) or with predictable improvements of this technology. 
</p>

<p>
In other words, compliance must be possible with existing design configurations or predictable advance over the current state of technology. Given the unpredictability of radical improvements, only incremental technological advance within existing design configurations or along established trajectories can be forecast with reasonable accuracy. Consequently, at the industry level, environmental regulation is expected to induce at best incremental improvements of BAT (for empirical evidence, see, Bellas 1998). Such imrpvements may require vigorous R&amp;D efforts but need to be attainable with near certainty.
</p>

<p>
177
</p>

<p>
For regulatory outcomes to be truly stringent, bureaucrats require credible information from industry that compliance will be technically feasible. This information may be supplied by one or a few firms that expect to benefit from a restrictive environmental regulation. This, however, only succeeds if, (a) these firms are able to credibly demonstrate the technological feasibility of a drastic pollution reduction, and (b) potential losers fail to get a hearing in the policy design process, that is, the political costs of the regulatory outcome need to be very low or (c) potential losers can be bought off with generous subsidies. Condition (b) may apply if economic victims fail to notice the costs that accrue to them or if they are unable to influence the policy design process. For example, economic victims of a stringent environmental regulation may be small and geographically dispersed so that possible job losses stay below the publi perception level. 
</p>

<p>
…<br>
In such cases, environmental regulation may induce the introduction and rapid improvement of hitherto fairly experimental technology. Moreover, it may induce the search for genuinely new alternatives by firms grappling to stay in the market who do not have access to this experimental technology. Search for entirely new technology by all firms is only expected if the only appropriate regulatory response to an environmental hazard is an immediate ban on a polluting product or activity and there is no, however inadequate, substitute. Albeit theoretically plausible, it remains to be empirically established whether such a situation has ever occurred. <br>
In both situations, politicians are expected to resort to generous subsidies to alleviate the private costs of environmental regulation, especially as subsidies typically go completely unnoticed by the general public. This allows them to adopt a restrictive stance on environmental pollution while socialising the <br>
178<br>
costs of compliance and thereby minimizing the political costs of a restrictive environmental policy intervention. Asa result, the effective economic impact of any environmental regulation is expected to be modest, even if compliance requires substantial technological changes in regulated industries. 
</p>

<p>
179
</p>

<p>
- the most common expected technological outcome of environmental regulation is diffusion of already existing technology<br>
- however, this technology may well improve in the process!

- all compliance options for Austrian VOC emission standards had been known for a considerable period of time to a large majority of the affected firms<br>
- no new technological compliance option was developed in the response to the strictest VOC regulation in the world<br>

- in Sept 1987, 93 countries signed the UNECE Montreal Protocol, setting a cap on CFC production at 1986 levels to be achieved by 1989 and stipulating a reduction by half by 1999<br>
- starting with DuPont in 1988, all major chemical companies announced a unilateral phaseout of CFCs in the subsequent two years<br>
- global CFC production declined to virtually nothing in the developed world in 1996 (UNEP 2000)
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
- although the Molina and Roland 1974 paper was originally a mere hypothesis, it was evident that if it could be proved, the production and use of CFCs would be banned or at least seriously restricted<br>
- this represented a major threat to manufacturers<br>
- DuPont was the world’s largest producer, supplying 25% of the global and almost 50% of the US market in 1993 (A SEED 1999)<br>
- DuPont publicly downplayed the significance of scientific findings, but started to invest in the search for substitutes<br>
- most important application covered by US Congress ban of 1978 (banned all uses for which feasible alternatives were available at reasonable costs) was propellant in aerosols; mechanical pumping system had been developed outside the chemical industry (Ashford et al. 1985:434)<br>
- as initial concern subsided as scientists were not able to come up with conclusive evidence, DuPont scaled back its search for alternatives and instead invested substantially to CFC production facilities<br>
- in 1980, the firm led the creation of the Alliance for Responsible CFC Policy (ARCFCP), an industry group with the stated aim of preventing, or at least mitigating, any further regulatory threat to the CFC business (Gabel 1995:330)<br>
- the discovery of “hole” in the Antarctic resurfaced the issue more urgently than ever before<br>
- many members of the ARCFCP argued that it should reinforce its efforts to fend off any further regulation; however, DuPont favored a proactive policy of a multilateral restriction on CFC production and ultimately prevailed<br>
- this paved way for Montreal accords (Gabel 1995:331)<br>
- the reversal of the strategy was prompted by 1) 1978 US ban, which had eliminated about half of the US market or about 1/4 of world demand, 2) in an industry where  production consisted almost entirely of fixed costs, this triggered a bitter price war, and 3) since demand for CFCs was virtually fixed, the price war was collectively disastrous for producers (Gabel 1995:334)<br>
- multilateral reductions limiting the production and hence the supply of CFCs became extremely attractive to companies faced with this price war<br>
286<br>
- in other words, environmental regulation adopted to meet the Montreal obligations “appears very much like a legally-enforced cartel, which apart from being highly stable had the additional advantage of looking like an environmentally responsive solution. Estimates of the regulatory rents involved at the time ranges from US$2 to US$ 9 billion for the US alone (see Gabel 1995:334; Adler 1996).”<br>
- however, DuPont had promised in 1974 to get out of CFCs if its role in ozone depletion could be proved (Gabel 1995:330)<br>
- additional reasons: 1) attempts to find substitutes for CFCs led to the development of two families of chemicals, hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) and hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs). <br>
- HFCs do not have chlorine atoms -&gt; no ozone depletion potential<br>
- HCFCs easier and cheaper to manufacture -&gt; transitional technology:<br>
When announcing its voluntary phase-out, DuPont only pledged to eliminate CFCs. Six months later, it announced heavy investments in both HCFCs and HFCs. R&amp;D had started in the 1970s and DuPont enjoyed a technological lead in both families of chemicals. Thus, DuPont’s substantial commitment could be interpreted as a deliberate move to present policymakers with a fait accompli to manage the phase-out according to its own preferences. In particular, this pertains to the transition from HCFCs to HFCs, where DuPont may have wanted to amortise its investments in HCFCs before eventually introducing HFC substitutes. <br>
Whether these were indeed the motives for DuPont’s behaviour remains unproven, but circumstantial evidence is strongly suggestive. In any case, events very much worked in DuPont’s favor: first, in that its move forced all other firms to follow suit and, second, in that the fait accompli was formalised in a series of amendments to the original Montreal protocol (see Section 3.4.3). However, HCFCs did not remain unrestricted, which may have been due to strategic behavior on the part of DuPont’s rivals who opted only to pursue the development of HFCs (see Gabel 1995:337-342). 
</p>

<p>
- i.e. this story in fact closely matches the pattern identified in the study:<br>
- CFC regulation started out in the face of massive uncertainty but immense public pressure<br>
- Policymaker’s first reaction was to ban all uses where substitutes existed<br>
- this led to diffusion and improvement of already available technology<br>
287<br>
- importantly, this also applied to subsequent regulations passed in the aftermath of the discovery of the “ozone hole” <br>
- the gradual halving of CFC production was only mandated after industry signalled its cooperation<br>
- the complete phase-out was only mandated after major producers had unilaterally pledged to discontinue CFC production
</p>

<p>
The case of CFC regulation thus reproduces the pattern that regulation is based on existing technology or technology that manufacturers signal will be available in the foreseeable future. Accordingly, while the regulations quite likely accelerated the development and diffusion of substitutes, compliance did not require the development of any new design configurations (although there are examples of quite ingenious substitutes which actually lowered total costs (see Gabel 1995:336)). <br>
Rather, these had been developed much earlier when the risk potential of CFCs had first been identified, underlining the importance of expectations for technological advance. Moreover, the case vividly illustrates the ability of firms to steer regulatory policy in their preferred direction.

<p>
8.4.2 Zero Emission Vehicle Regulation
</p>

<p>
- in 1990, California embarked on an ambitious plan to reduce vehicle emissions to 0 through the gradual introduction of zero emission vehicles (ZEVs)<br>
- CARB stipulated that at least 2%, 5%, and 10% of new car sales must be ZEV by 1998, 2001 and 2003 respectively<br>
- first two targets applied only to manufacturers selling more than 35 000 cars/year, i.e. only to largest manufacturers<br>
- by 2003, the threshold would decline to 3000 vehicles/year (see Wallace 1995)<br>
- at the time of regulation’s promulgation, the only way to satisfy the extremely restrictive standards were battery powered vehicles<br>
- this appears to refute the central prediction made above: policymakers will only adopt environmental regulation if they are reasonably certain that firms will be able to comply<br>
288<br>
- one or a few firms managed to capture regulators to create a market for their products, as  in the case of CFC regulation; these technologies need not be available, but firms must be able to credibly demonstrate their availability at the time the regulation enters into force.<br>
 - Wallace (1995): ZEV due to confluence of 2 factors, 1) economic situation in California, state had slipped to a serious recession in late 1980s and 2) General Motors’s chairman was convinced by the interest to GM Impact, a solar-powered vehicle project, which had debuted at the Los Angeles Motor Show early in 1990; GM had lost ground to Japanese rivals. A major development programme for Impact was announced in April 1990; GM envisioned it as an opportunity to regain its previous dominance. In the years of further development required, GM needed some assurance that market would exist. By committing resources to the project, the firm made an implicit offer to policymakers that if a market could be created, GM would be able to supply the vehicle.  
</p>

<p>
289
</p>

<p>
- GM’s offer was highly attractive to policymakers as it offered the prospect of creating 55000 jobs in EV component manufacture by 2000 (Wallace 1995:164)<br>
…the Californian zero emission rules were the outcome of an extreme case of rent-seeking by a single firm on the one hand and extraordinarily gullible policymakers on the other. Even though the rules eventually turned out to be clearly technology-forcing, this is not what the policymakers had in mind when issuing them in 1990. Instead, and in line with what has been predicted above, they evidently believed in GM’s assertions. In this respect, the Californian zero emission rules resemble the case of the first LMVO studied at length in Section 7.3, where quite restrictive standards were issued based on information from industry that compliant technology would be developed before long. When it turned out that these estimates had been too optimistic, rules were relaxed to reflect technological reality.<br>
This is also what happened in the case of the ZEV regulation. In 1991 and 1992, GM ran up combined losses of US$ 12 billion, at that time the highest annual loss ever recorded in US corporate history. This forced GM to look for opportunities to cut costs aggressively. One of the first victims was the full Impact programme which was cancelled in 1993 in favour of a much less ambitions (and less expensive) version. In the meantime, radical advance in battery technology, which would have been necessary to guarantee acceptable driving ranges, had failed to materialise, while other substitute technologies such as fuel cells, hybrids and natural gas engines underwent rapid improvements.<br>
- ZEV mandate modified in 1996; eliminated the quotas for ZEVs until 2003<br>
- second modification in 1998; 10% quota reduced to 4%, and for the remaining 6%, manufacturers could choose to sell pure ZEVs or use credits from Partial Zero Emission Vehicles like natgas cars<br>
290<br>
- further modified in Jan 2001, reducing the number of ZEVs needed to comply and instead increasing the number of permissible PZEVs <br>
- required percentage of ZEVs gradually increased from 10% in 2003 to 16% in 2018
</p>

<p>
Thus, after the “historical accident” which led to the adoption of the ZEV rules in the first place, repeated subsequent policy changes were made to ensure that compliance would actually be possible. As to how costly compliance will be is hard to determine. However, the political costs of a forced introduction of cleaner vehicles in California are fairly limited as it has no “domestic” automobile industry to speak of, while car manufacturers will have to offer cleaner vehicles at a competitive price if they want to satisfy the mandated quotas. Put very cynically, the Californian ZEV rules almost amount to a case of legal extortion. <br>
As in all other cases described in this book, the ZEV rules were, therefore, only adopted after policymakers had come to believe that compliance would be technologically feasible and — crucially — at a very low political cost to them. When this turned out to be incorrect, the regulations were repeatedly amended to ensure a feasible outcome. Thus, they conform quite well to the expected pattern. <br>
However, this case is also particularly intriguing as it vividly demonstrates the way in which regulation may work as a “focusing device” (see Section 4.3). Although the automobile industry has until now failed to develop a viable alternative to the petrol-fuelled internal combustion engine, it would never have come so far without the Californian ZEV rules. This underlines yet again that technological advance can only be steered via influencing firms’ expectations.

<p>
Summary and Policy Implications
</p>

<p>
The ultimate regulatory outcome depends on institutional factors, bureaucrats’ control of the regulatory agenda and the political costs and benefits of environmental policy intervention. On the one hand, voters demand environmental protection. On the other hand, for all but exceptionally threatening environmental hazards, voters are unwilling to accept a significant reduction of wealth. As a consequence, politicians will try to supply environmental policy outcomes that satisfy the general public’s desire for pollution reduction but do not have salient distributional consequences.<br>
This is where technology comes in. Any environmental policy intervention that forces firms to change their established production methods entails adaptation costs, even though these may be more than offset by long-run benefits. However, such benefits are not evident at the time the regulation is adopted, otherwise rational firms would have implemented the changes already. <br>
…<br>
In any case, costs can only be determined on the basis of existing technology or foreseeable improvements thereof because more radical technological advance cannot be predicted with reasonable accuracy. Moreover, an environmental regulation needs to be enforceable, which is only guaranteed if policymakers can be certain that compliant technology will be available. <br>
From these observations, it was hypothesised that compliance at most induces predictable and hence incremental improvement of BAT at the industry level. At the level of the individual firm, however, need for change may be substantial, since not all firms produce at or close to the technological possibility frontier and compliant technology may be a minority design that hitherto has rarely been applied in the regulated industry.Accordingly, the most common expected technological outcome of environmental regulation is the diffusion of already existing technology. In light of what is known about technology diffusion, it is quite likely that improvements along natural trajectories may be observable, especially in terms of better performance, greater reliability and lower costs. 
</p>

<p>
295
</p>

<p>
In economic terms, the expected impact of these changes is moderate, as political considerations dictate that compliance must be affordable for most firms. Therefore, compliance costs are expected to be rather modest, as is the impact on competitiveness. In cases where this cannot be secured, politicians are expected to provide generous financial support and socialise private costs of compliance.<br>
There are only two cases when regulatory outcomes may diverge from this predicted pattern. The first has been mentioned already, namely if an environmental risk is so threatening that it requires truly drastic measures, in particular the outright ban of a substance, product or activity. If no substitute, however inadequate, is available, a ban may set off a search for entirely novel ways of doing things. <br>
The second case in which an environmental regulation may mandate very ambitious pollution reduction may be if, (a) one or a few firms with very advanced technological knowledge manage to credibly demonstrate the technological feasibility of a drastic pollution reduction, and (b) potential losers can be bought off with generous subsidies. <br>
- but this regulation is not expected to trigger the development of radically new technology<br>
- successful regulatory capture may create appropriate conditions for the introduction of substantially different technology, it is unlikely to stimulate the development of entirely new technology as an outright ban may do. <br>
The reason is once more the inherent unpredictability of radical technological advance, as rent-seeking firms can only attempt to push technology they can credibly demonstrate to be available in the foreseeable future.<br>
- the book’s detailed study of the design and techno-economic consequences of three Austrian VOC emission standards (the most restrictive of their kind in the world) has provided “ample empirical support” for this
</p>

<p>
296
</p>

<p>
These observations cast doubt on the possibility of forcing the development of radically new cleaner technology (in the sense of new design configurations) by means of appropriate environmental regulation, as suggested by radical proponents of the Porter Hypothesis. Environmental regulation may and frequently will stimulate the diffusion and incremental improvement of existing technology. It can drive out the worst offenders and collectively move a polluting industry closer to the current technological possibility frontier (see, for example, Boyd and McClelland 1999; Alpay et al. 2002). However, it does not accelerate cleaner technological progress by fostering the development of radically new design configurations. Although theoretically possible, such regulatory policy interventions carry too great an economic and hence political price to get enacted, expect under very exceptional circumstances. <br>
In other words, although plausible in theory and also in practice, as few firms operate at or in the vicinity of the current “green” production possibility frontier before an environmental regulation is passed, the inducement effect of actual environmental regulation is simply too small to produce the innovative compliance response on which radical proponents of the Porter Hypothesis rely. If the underlying argument is correct, “full innovation offsets” may occur in exceptional cases, but will not be the systematic outcome of environmental regulation, however “properly constructed.” Furthermore, this implies that the failure to find sizeable economic consequences of environmental regulation is less the result of measurement problems than due to their genuine absence, as policymakers design actual environmental policy in such a way that it does not entail salient negative economic consequences.
</p>

<p>
- the probably the most important lesson of the analysis is that one should not expect too much from environmental policy:<br>
The purpose of environmental policy is to reduce pollution to a level where marginal costs of abatement equal marginal benefits. <br>
…environmental policy is not a suitable policy instrument for bringing about radical cleaner technological advance and should therefore not be mistake for some sort of technology policy in disguise. 
</p>

<p>
297
</p>

<p>
- but this does not invalidate environmental policy!<br>
- pollution reductions HAVE been achieved<br>
- the suggestion is that when designing an environmental policy intervention, policymakers should not strive to pursue multiple goals<br>
- instead, focus on mandating the socially desirable amount of pollution reduction and implementing the resulting environmental regulation as efficiently as possible
</p>

<p>
One important component of efficient regulation is to focus on outcomes while providing polluters with as much discretion as possible as to how they attain compliance. In most cases, this will imply the use of market-based instruments which do not require uniform pollution reduction from all firms, although there may be instances when other instruments are preferable (see Helfand 1998; Russel and Powell 1998).<br>
…<br>
Possibly even more important than choosing the optimal policy instrument is the way that it is designed and enforced, so as to avoid the adoption of inefficient technology and the creation of barriers to innovation.

- investments in better access of environmental information and education required to make sense of them important to create public pressure while avoiding mass hysterias and the risk of political manipulation
</p>

<p>
300
</p>

<p>
For a number of reasons, truly novel technological solutions are frequently developed by “outsiders” rather than established incumbents. (HOX HOX: miten suhtautuu Giffard 2011:n teoriaan teollisuuden merkityksestä kuitenkin?)<br>
- First, they may face novel problems and then be able to leverage the new technological solution in other markets<br>
301<br>
- Second, they may have less to lose from cannibalising existing activities<br>
- they may also be less constrained by existing technological paradigm<br>
- Finally, “hungry outsiders” may be willing to take greater risks to enter or establish a new market
</p>

<p>
- firms resisting a policy intervention tend to overstate compliance costs<br>
- firms seeking to create a market for their products may understate compliance costs and be over-optimistic as to the development potentials of the technologies they are trying to push<br>
- ZEV rule and the case of Austrian LMVO demonstrate the problems that may arise if policymakers put too much faith in firms’ predictions of future technological advance
</p>

<p>
As a rule of thumb, policymakers should therefore never base regulation on technology that firms claim will be available in more than about three years time. As argued in Section 4.4, it may be possible to predict with fairly high accuracy how a technology will evolve along established trajectories of advance, in particular if prototypes already exist. Any longer-term predictions, however, are pure speculation and hence very shaky foundations for enforceable environmental policy. 
</p>

<p>
302
</p>

<p>
- much-criticised BAT clauses may have to be re-evaluated<br>
- BAT-mandating regulations are often criticised for failing to create dynamic incentives for innovation<br>
- this is valid in theory but less pertinent in practice<br>
- the real challenge is not to stay too far behind the current technological possibility frontier - not in implementing regulation that requires firms to go beyond BAT
</p>

<p>
The case against BAT rests on the assumption that other types of regulation create ongoing pressure for firms to reduce pollution, which in turn presumes that if the price of a polluting input rises, firms will look for cheaper alternatives. Firms may certainly look for cheaper alternatives, but whether they succeed is far from guaranteed. <br>
- TiO2 example<br>
- even a tenfold increase in oil prices between 1973 and 1983 did not lead to anything more than the marginal use of alternative energy technologies (Kemp et al. 1998:184). <br>
This suggest that in order to induce sizeable technological adaptations, market-based instruments would have to raise prices of polluting inputs by amounts that are entirely unthinkable in the present political environment. Moreover, it is precisely because such instruments create ongoing pressure to find alternatives to polluting products and activities that firms may have successfully resisted their introduction. Because it is difficult to establish a direct link between for instance an environmental tax and technological adaptations, the tendency to implement symbolic environmental policy may lead to the adoption of a token tax rate with a marginal impact on polluting firms.<br>
303<br>
In this respect, a market-based instrument may induce even less innovation than a standard, despite the latter’s dynamic weaknesses. 
</p>

<p>
The main conclusion of this book is that the most that can be achieved with environmental regulation is the diffusion and incremental improvement of BAT. Therefore, mandating and constantly updating BAT may be a feasible way to ensure that this potential is fully exploited. 
</p>

<p>
- mandating experimental technology may backfire
</p>

<p>
- immediate compliance may induce firms to opt for tried and tested solutions instead of experimenting with more innovative and possibly more efficient technologies if they were granted some transition period to comply<br>
- therefore, environmental policy should be based on ambitious targets, that is, technology close to or slightly beyond the current technological possibility frontier but allow for phase-in periods to give firms sufficient time to perfect cleaner products or processes.
</p>

<p>
305
</p>

<p>
Rather than defining narrow targets which need to be based on existing technology and create a commitment problem if firms fail to come up with viable technological solutions, policymakers should single out hazardous substances, products or activities, communicate their risk potential and make clear that as soon as appropriate alternatives become available, polluting substances, products or activities will be restricted or even banned.<br>
This may set off an innovation race, where the first firm(s) coming up with a feasible solution may enjoy temporary monopoly profits akin to the ones awarded by the patent system. As well as avoiding the above commitment problem, such a policy does not need to rely on existing technology. Thus, it may harness the creative potential of industry and ensure coordination between the different parties involved in the innovation process by creating common expectations
