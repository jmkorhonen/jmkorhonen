“The honor, and a great one it is, of making the first attempt to devise a political order based on the assumption that everyone is born equal and that no one has any more rights than anyone else belongs to Thomas Hobbes in Leviathan (1651). From him it passed to various Enlightenment thinkers who fervently hoped to establish equality inside their own polities. But there is a difference. Hobbes’ citizens were equal in the sense that none of them had any rights at all, a situation he saw as essential on the way to achieving his overriding goal, i.e. the maintenance of law and order.”

“His successors, to the contrary, saw equality as a prerequisite to liberty and justice. They wanted upper-class privileges to be abolished so middle-class people like themselves could forge ahead as fast, and as far, as possible. That is why their version of it has often been called liberal equality. One and all, they would have approved of what the well-known late nineteenth-century Cambridge historian, Lord Acton, had to say: “power [meaning, a situation where some people exercise unequal power over others] tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely.”[4]”

“Hobbes himself was a European (never mind that the British remain reluctant to admit that fact). So were the remaining prophets of liberal equality. Thanks to colonialism, which paradoxically created as much inequality as has ever existed at any time and place, that kind of equality spread from Europe and European-settled North America to other parts of the world.”

“As one of my teachers used to say, for centuries past people in the so-called “developing world” did not know they were equal. But by the 1960s, and thanks above all to the invention of the little transistor radio, the message had reached them—with a vengeance.”

“As the title of one of the first important works devoted to the purpose, Arthur de Gobineau’s Essay on the Inequality of the Human Races (1853-1855) indicates, racism was specifically meant to prove that some people were superior to others.”

“Take the so-called band societies, the simplest known human ones of all. Until 1860 or so one of them, that of the Andaman Islanders in southern India, represented one of the most isolated populations on earth. Probably no group of contemporary people so much resembled our Stone Age ancestors. The Andamanese seem to have originated in present-day Burma and reached the islands some sixty thousand years ago by way of a long-defunct land bridge. Marco Polo, who probably did not visit them but heard about them second-hand, noted that they did not have a king. He described them as “a most brutish and savage race, having heads, eyes, and teeth like those of dogs. They are very cruel, and kill and eat every foreigner on whom they can lay their hands.”[13”

“Andamanese had almost no contact with the outside world.[14] The population may have stood at 5,000-6,000. Since then it has dwindled to a few hundred at most. They were divided into some ten tribes each of which spoke a different language, though most were mutually intelligible. Their material culture was rudimentary indeed. Perhaps alone among all the humans in the world, the islanders did not have the technology for kindling fire, though they did know how to preserve it and make use of it. Property consisted of relatively scanty clothing and ornaments, implements such as nets, buckets, bows, arrows, and similar items used for fishing, hunting, and preparing food. There were also simple shelters, made of widely available materials, to live in or under, but nothing that could not be erected by almost any individual within a few hours. As a result, division of labor and specialization were very largely limited to those that naturally follow from differences in age and sex.”

“The land and sea from which people drew their subsistence was regarded as belonging to all members of each tribe in common. Expanses of it would, however, be defended against encroachments by foreigners. A tribe might also expand at the expense of is neighbors. There were periods of famine, which could be caused either by an expanding population or by some natural disaster. Normally, though, the surroundings provided enough for everyone. Food and other items belonged to whoever had gathered, hunted, or made them. Partly because there was no need, partly because so many organic products are hard to preserve over time, there was no propensity towards monopolizing, hoarding, or trading in material objects. Exchange was limited to reciprocal gift-giving. It took place mainly at appropriate times such as feasts and was sufficiently universal and frequent to preserve a condition of rough economic equality. After all, what was there to own? There was no government in the sense of a clearly distinct person or persons endowed with power and/or privilege others did not enjoy.”

“Still it is necessary to take note of the following facts: First, common forms of address clearly distinguished between husbands and wives, parents and children, seniors and juniors. Since kinship was almost the only relationship that tied different people together, this led to numerous gradations as well as sharply differentiated rights and obligations”

“Second, one basic principle on which the bands were built was that anyone who had food was obliged to share it with those who did not. However, in the words of the great anthropologist who studied the islands, “should a young unmarried man kill a pig he must be content to see it distributed by one of the older men, the best parts going to the seniors, while he and his companions must be satisfied with the inferior parts. The result of these customs is… that the younger men do not do so well as their elders.”

“Old men, in other words, were in a position to control some food they did not produce. The same, incidentally, was true of other band societies around the world, such as the Agta of Luzon and the Yanomamo of Paraguay. Conversely, feminist scholars have complained that women used to get less than their fair share. If so, then this was probably because men, who did most of the hunting and offshore fishing, produced the food containing the most protein. They used this fact to enhance their status”

“Third and perhaps most important, some individuals were supposed to possess greater supernatural powers than others. As the same anthropologist says, “these specially favored persons corresponded, to some degree, with the medicine men, magicians, or shamans of other primitive societies.”[18] Depending on which island they came from, they were known as oko-jumu or oko-paiad. They were supposed to control the weather; an idea, we may safely assume, has never occurred either to a bonobo or to a chimpanzee. The outcome was that everyone was anxious to be on their good side. Though they did not necessarily have authority, let alone power, over others, they certainly had more than their share of influence”

“Briefly, even in the simplest known human society of all, simpler even than the tribes of the highlands of Papua/New Guinea, some people were considered more equal than others. Indeed it might be said that, to the extent that any kind of organization existed both inside and outside the family, it both rested on inequality and perpetuated it. Furthermore, as the fact that the young were obliged to feed the old and the existence of shamans shows, relationships were not governed solely by personal prowess, as among animals. Other factors also made themselves felt.”

“Unlike the Andamanese, Australian Aborigines had the technical means to kindle fire.[19] Their habitat was as isolated but poor in resources and infinitely larger, making for a more nomadic lifestyle. Yet in some other ways they were similar. Some Andamanese are Negritos, meaning that they have short stature, dark skins, and so-called “peppercorn” hair. This has caused some anthropologists to suggest that the two groups are somehow related. People lived in bands based on kinship ties, though in both cultures a closer examination would show that many of those ties were not natural but fictive and formed by adoption”

“While there were no rulers, within each band parents had some authority over the young and seniors over juniors. In particular elders, thanks to their supposed proximity to the spirit-world and their ability to influence it, enjoyed respect. Often they could obtain resources from the young and make their views prevail.”

“One author has suggested that they manipulated the young men, making them fight each other. Based on these factors as well as sex, each individual knew his or her place and had his or her carefully defined rights and duties. To that extent there could be no question of equality. Too, within each tribe some bands were superior to others.”

“A third people that might be cited in this context are, or were, the Nuer of the Southern Sudan. Like the Andamanese and the Aborigines, the Nuer had no rulers, no institutions, and no government. It is said that their community was best described as an “ordered anarchy.”[21] The technology at their disposal was more developed than that of the others. However, they too had few material possessions. Those they did have were simple enough to be manufactured out of locally available materials by almost anyone for his or her immediate needs. Land, forest and sources of water were “owned” by the whole tribe in common. What puts the Nuer on an altogether different level from the other two, though, is the fact that they were herders and possessed cattle. From it they drew an important part of their nutrition as well as many other necessities.”

“So important was cattle to the people’s life that wealth was measured almost exclusively in terms of the number of heads a person or family owns. Competition for it was very keen. Some had more heads, others fewer. However, here was also an elaborate system of obligatory exchange between families. It took place as a result of births, weddings, and deaths, but also in the form of blood-money. Usually it kept inequality within fairly clear bounds.”

“As among the Andamanese and the Aborigines, Nuer fathers had some authority over children, uncles over nephews, and older siblings over younger ones. As among the Aborigines, some persons were supposed to have better access to magic powers than others. This turned them into natural leaders. Particularly important were the so-called prophets. Supposedly possessed by some god or gods, they were able to predict the future and initiate military expeditions (although they did not command). A close analogy is the Prophetess Dvora in the Old Testament book of Judges. In her own words, she caused the people to wake up and rise against their oppressors.”

“To return to the Nuer, their prophets did not represent or symbolize anybody or anything. Though the spirit rested on them, they did not have authority, let alone formal authority and the power to make it felt. Yet they certainly did have influence. That the line separating the two things is often a fine one hardly requires saying.<br>
The Nuer resembled the Australian Aborigines in that some clans considered themselves aristocratic (diel) and were considered to be so by others. Others were associated, or rul. In case of murder, people belonging to the former class were entitled to claim more blood money that those of the latter. Apparently the distinction was based on the fact that the individuals forming the clans in question consist of pure-bred Nuer. In this they differed from others who had an admixture of Dinka blood brought about in the past by means of war, capture, and adoption.”

“Here, in other words, we see ancestry playing a role in shaping the social pecking order. But ancestry was only one of the factors involved. Some lineages, though specifically known to be “new,” enjoyed elevated status. It was derived from the fact that they were considered to have superior power in relation to cattle. That included the ability to heal sick beasts or make barren cows have calves. Indeed the standard work on the Nuer, one of the best anthropological studies ever written, is full of expressions such as “senior” and “dominant.”

“The mere fact that some clans were larger than others would tend to make them more influential. The Andamanese, the Aborigines, the Nuer, and many others prove that even the politically least developed, materially most egalitarian, societies on earth recognized that different individuals are related in different ways. They also recognize, of course, that individuals have different abilities. It is these differences that caused differing individuals to have different rights and duties. Those guilty of violating those duties and those rights might find themselves severely punished as the rest, incited and organized, but hardly commanded, by some of the more equal, turned on them. It is unlikely that any of these societies were based on the assumption that everybody does, or should, enjoy exactly the same status, rights, and duties as everyone else.”

“The eponymous—meaning that it covers both a tribe and the language its members speak—term Dinka simply means “people.” The Dinkas’ Nuer neighbors, of course, see things the other way around. The best translation of the word Bantu, widely used across Africa and variously pronounced Watu or Batu or Bato or Abantu or Vanhu or Vandu, is said to be “human.” The implication, namely that everyone else is sub-human or nonhuman, hardly needs to be spelt out. Lokono, the name of a tribe and a language in the Caribbean, also means “people.” The Blackfoot Indians of Montana and Alberta called themselves Niitsítapi, the "Original People". Yup’ik, the name of some Inuit groups that inhabit both sides of the Bering Strait, is a composite word. It is derived from yuk meaning “person,” and the post-base -pik meaning “real” or “genuine.” Thus its literal meaning is “real people.”[24”

The Sotho-Tswana of South Africa regularly add the prefix Ama, meaning “unfamiliar,” to the names of other peoples besides themselves. The Greeks called foreigners barbaroi, barbarians. The implication was that they could not speak properly and were less than fully human. As Aristotle later put it, they were, “by nature, slaves,” unable to govern themselves but in need of a master (despotes; in Greek, the word can refer both to a slave-owner and to a political ruler) who, of course, towered above his subjects and was anything but equal with them.[25] Other examples abound.

“Many of them greatly admired the equality, and consequently the freedom from oppression, that “savages” in distant lands supposedly enjoyed. Volume after volume celebrated their simplicity, their honesty, their courage, their generosity (also in the sense that they shared their women and gave them to anybody who wanted them), in short their nobility. A perfect example of the genre is Diderot’s Supplément au Voyage de Bougainville. Written in 1772, it was banned during his lifetime and only published after the Revolution when it quickly became a classic. Even better known was Jean-Jacques Rousseau (1712-1778). He neatly summed up the matter when he wrote that “man was born free, and he is everywhere in chains.”[28]”

“Nineteenth-century travelers, imperialists and ethnographers tended to take the opposite view. The customs, particularly in respect to sex, which their predecessors had interpreted as noble and exalted, they saw as bestial. As with Rousseau, every “savage” was supposedly equal to every other and did not have any authority over him. Thus the communities in which they lived were understood as mere “hordes.” They lacked the organization needed for taking large-scale collective action, let alone building and maintaining a sophisticated civilization”

“A third group, the socialists, took a kind of middle way. Most of them bitterly opposed European colonialism in other continents. Instead they chose to follow Rousseau, celebrating the absence of private property and the egalitarian nature of the simplest societies known to them. Marx himself, in some of his early writings, explicitly turned his face against the "alienation" that the division of labor entailed.[32]”

“Under the aristocracy—from the Greek aristoi, “excellent ones”—came commoners. Often they were known by all kinds of derogatory names. In early Greece they were called thetes (laborers) and kakoi (bad ones). In Thessaly they were known as penestai, meaning either toilers or poor men. The Natchez Indians of Oklahoma spoke of “stinkers.” Many chiefdoms also had distinct populations of serfs and/or slaves who occupied the bottom of the hierarchy. The total number of classes might therefore be as many as four, as in Anglo-Saxon England and pre-Christian Scandinavia, or even five, as in Tahiti and Hawaii. To make things more complicated still, in some chiefdoms, presumably those whose origins owed much to war and conquest, members of the upper class or classes were ethnically distinct from those of the lower ones.

“The Old Testament book of Joshua provides a good example of such an ethnically-based society.

“The important point is that, in all this, there was not even a pretense at equality. From the chief down, superiors, while engaged in an unending game of musical chairs among themselves in which the prize was power, ruled and exploited. Commoners either accepted their fate or were destroyed. Often they only had access to economic resources provided they paid some kind of tribute to their superiors; whether in the form of sharecropping, or forced labor, or the duty to hand over choice goods. That might even include their daughters. That was how the famous “Amazons” of Dahomey (Benin) originated. Far from being independent warrior women, they were officially the king’s concubines, recruited by means of an annual levy”

“In summary, all human societies recognize differences of age and sex which translate into differences in the ability to produce food as well as different rights and duties. Those factors apart, it seems reasonable to surmise that some of the oldest justifications for inequality originated in magic, spirit-worship, religion, or whatever a sense of the supernatural is called. That was the thesis of late nineteenth-century anthropologists such as James Fraser in The Golden Bough (1890). They theorized that at first, prophets, shamans, and assorted miracle-workers were able to translate their knowledge into influence. As influence gradually grew into authority, authority into power, and power into property and privilege, chiefdoms emerged. However, history suggests that things did not proceed in such a simple linear order”

“Excavations in Russia show that, even 30,000 years ago and long before the so-called agricultural revolution made permanent settlements possible, some people were buried along with comparatively vast wealth. Others were interred with hardly anything at all. The former were probably chiefs, the latter commoners.[44] How it came about we simply do not know. Furthermore, among humans as well as many animals, inequality, accompanied by deference—meaning inequality that is recognized—was exactly what held the community or group together. Had it been otherwise, individuals competing for material and sexual resources, would presumably have torn one another to pieces. Not just occasionally, as is actually the case, but all of the time.”

“The first people to discover ways of constructing a community based, in some ways, on equality were the ancient Greeks. Unfortunately information about that period tends to be very scarce.It is essentially limited to archaeological remains and the poems of Homer and Hesiod. There are also many mythological tales, such as those involving gods, monsters, and supernatural deeds. However, their mythological character, plus the fact that they were written down centuries after the events they claim to describe, renders their value problematic. There are also some odd bits and pieces in the writings of Greek historians who lived during the classical period. The fact that, during the so-called dark ages, writing was not practiced does not make things any easier.”

“Judging by those few sources, between about 1100 BC and 700 BC Greece was inhabited by groups occupying a middle position between band societies and chiefdoms. In the Iliad, the paramount chief is Agamemnon. To quote Thersites again, “[Agamemnon’s] tents are full of copper and many choice captive women.” Whenever a city was captured he took the best spoils for himself as, indeed, he was entitled to do. He was surrounded by lesser chiefs of whom Odysseus, judging by the number of warriors he was able to muster, was one of the less important. They are described as “generous;” from them he received “gifts,” and over them he exercised a certain authority. That”

“Yet Agamemnon was no despot. Particularly interesting is his relationship with Achilles. As an individual warrior Achilles was more than a match for Agamemnon and both of them knew it. Yet the latter could tell the former that, if necessary, he would invade his, Achilles’, camp and take away his prize, the girl Briseis. Doing so, he would teach Achilles “how much greater I am than you, and another man will shrink before declaring himself my equal.”[1]”

“Thus their relationship was based neither on authority nor on equality but on a certain balance. Furthermore, once the war had ended each sub-chief went home to his asty, best translated as “citadel.” There is no indication that any of them continued to be under Agamemnon’s authority, let alone paid tribute to him.

“From Hesiod, who probably lived slightly later than Homer, we learn that some people were wealthy and powerful, others poor and humble. The former often oppressed the latter, and indeed the poem known as Works and Days can be read as a protest against that oppression. Still the poet does not demand to have equality imposed and the chiefs deposed, only that they should be just.[3]”

“Given this unpromising background, how did the Greek chiefdoms avoid developing into even more unequal bureaucratic or feudal polities—a process which, as we shall see, was the common fate of countless similar societies around the world? Certainly the idea of equality, with all its complex socio-economic-political implications, cannot have reached Greece from the Orient. True, socially, economically and politically the Middle East during this period was much more advanced than Greece, a small”

“Furthermore, the fact that certain peoples lived on extensive plains, as both the Australian aborigines and the Indians of North America did, in itself did not necessarily result in the rise of empires. As the Mongolians’ ability to resist Chinese rule for millennia on end shows, large open spaces could be used just as well for escaping a central authority as for building it. Briefly, geography and the biosphere that goes with it can explain much. But on its own it cannot tell us why some societies developed in certain ways and others did not.”

“the rise of the classical polis from during the seventh century BC with the emergence of hoplite warfare.[9] Such warfare, waged by tightly-packed formations, demanded very close cooperation among similarly armed, similarly trained, heavy infantrymen maneuvering in step. Even commanders no longer waged separate duels against one another, as in the Iliad. Instead they often fought in the ranks like everyone else.[10] Thus the power of the community increased, whereas that of the chiefs declined. The trouble with this interpretation is that phalanx-like fighting formations, organized, paid for, and presumably commanded by monarchs or their appointees, were well-known both in Egypt and Mesopotamia at least since the third millennium BC on. After all, it does not take much intellectual effort to see that, given suitable terrain, cohesive, disciplined, bodies of troops can do certain things that mere skirmishers cannot do. Such bodies acted as instruments of royal power, even its symbols. Yet there was no question of them leading to equality or to democracy.”

“Some have tried to link the emergence of Greek democracy with monogamy.[11] The fact that Greek men were only allowed to have one wife, they argue, meant that more of them were able to marry. This in turn led to a less varied rate of reproduction and greater equality among the citizens. As already noted, however, this explanation ignores the fact that in practice, chiefs such as Agamemnon and Odysseus could, and did, have as many women as they wanted. The Romans were no less monogamous than the Greeks, and no more so during the Republic than during the Empire. Yet this did not prevent what started as a city-state on the shores of the Tiber from growing into one of the most hierarchical empires in the whole of history. Furthermore, the collapse of Rome laid the basis for European, i.e. Christian, feudalism. Christianity always expected each man and woman to have only one legitimate spouse at any one moment”

“A third explanation, rarely mentioned in the literature, is a change in the way religion was organized. As we saw religion, meaning some kind of claim of closeness to the gods, has as good a claim as any to be the earliest basis of inequality first, and then of government. However, that does not apply to the world as it emerges from the Homeric poems. Instead the Iliad presents us with two priests, Charises (the father of Briseis) and Kalchas. Both serve the gods, pray to them, and sometimes have their prayers answered. Yet neither is said to be their scion. Nor does either of them rule over anybody or anything.”

“Begging Agamemnon for the return of his daughter, Charises in particular cuts a somewhat pathetic figure. Conversely the Homeric chiefs, even those who are said to be descended from gods or to be god-like, do not explicitly base their right to rule on that fact. Nor do they act as their own head priests. Their authority is secular, not religious.”

“When, why and how the Homeric chiefs surrendered their special ties with the gods and ceased to rely on divine backing to buttress their secular rule we have no idea. But clearly it was one step, and a very important step, towards the classical city-state and the kind of equality that sometimes prevailed in them. The magistrates who governed city-states did not, in the main, owe their positions to the gods. Conversely, Greek priests were for the most part magistrates like all others.[12] Other explanations as to the origins of the city-state abound, but none so solid that no holes can be punched into it. Better, then, to take the polis, a self-governing city state, for granted, and trace the nature and development of our subject, equality, within it.”

“Sparta, Plutarch says, had long been ruled by two basileis. “[The Spartans] felt that their kings were such in name and station only, but in everything else were nothing better than their subjects” and prone to the same human weaknesses.[18] As a result the city tended, now towards the excesses of tyranny, now towards the instability of democracy. To correct this problem Lycurgus appointed a Senate made up of twenty-eight men over sixty years old serving for life. As each one passed away, the popular assembly, comprising all adult male Spartiates, chose another by acclamation. Their function was to act as a “sort of balance for the ship of state, putting her on a steady keel.”

“Finally, either Lycurgus or one of his successors—our sources differ on this point—instituted the ephors, or “overseers.” Five in number, they were elected annually and charged with supervising the kings. The Senate and the kings had the sole right to convene the assembly and submit business to it. However, in case the latter tried to handle matters of which the ephors did not approve they were entitled to adjourn it. In all this, the major deviations from equality were the fact that private individuals could not speak in the assembly; that only old men could be elected to the Senate; and that the kingship was hereditary and limited to members of just two families, the Agiads and the Eurypontids. When somebody asked Lycurgus about this his response, presented as a typical example of “Laconian” brevity and pungency, was to tell the man to “go and first establish democracy in your own household.” Here it is worth noting that, in Plato’s view, the real rulers were the ephors.”

“Many modern historians believe the reforms were not carried out by a single person but gradually over a much longer period, and only later attributed to Lycurgus. Even if the latter existed, clearly he had to overcome considerable opposition and did not accomplish everything at once. Much more important for our purposes, equality among the Spartiates was achieved at the cost of the helots.”

“Around the middle of the fifth century BC the process whereby the number of Spartiates declined accelerated. To quote the invaluable Plutarch again, “in the reign of Agis [king Agis II, who died in 401 AD], gold and silver money first flowed into Sparta. With money came greed and a desire for wealth prevailed through the agency of Lysander [the Spartan general who defeated Athens and brought the Peloponnesian War to an end], who, though incorruptible himself, filled his country with the love of riches and with luxury, by bringing home gold and silver from the war.”[23] Loot apart, additional money came from Persia. At this time the Persian empire was subsidizing Sparta, thereby permitting funds to be diverted from the state into the pockets of private individuals. Having grown rich, the latter were able to buy their fellows’ kleroi, plots of land, turning the former owners into a landless proletariat and disenfranchising them”

“By the time of Aristotle (384-322 BC) there were fewer than 1,000 Spartiates left. Plutarch says that, at the Battle of Leuctra in 371, BC the number of Lacedaemonians present stood at 11,000”

“At the accession of King Agis IV in 244 BC the figure had gone down to just 700. During the third century BC several attempts were made to arrest the decline. This was done by emancipating perioikoi and helots, requisitioning the land, and redistributing it among the citizens. As one may imagine, the reforms did not exactly meet with everyone’s approval; one of Agis’ successors, Nabis (who reigned from 207 to 192 BC), even executed the last remaining members of the two traditional royal families. He also forced the women of Sparta to marry the newly emancipated men.[24] It was a case of too little, too late.”

“Ultimately nothing was left of the famous Spartan prowess except a handful of youths. In a special ceremony attended by tourists, they allowed themselves to be flogged to death.<br>
Let us move on from Sparta to Athens. Here we find that equality, known as isonomia (literally, “equality in front of the law”), only started taking hold towards the middle of the sixth century BC. It was associated mainly with the names of two famous reformers, Solon, who lived from about 638 BC to 558 BC, and Cleisthenes who must have been active during the years just before 500 BC”

“The reform that, at the time and later, acquired the greatest fame was the seisachtheia, literally “the shaking off of burdens.”[25] The meaning of the phrase is not quite clear. However, it seems to have been related to ownership over land. Previously Athenian law made land inalienable, meaning it had to remain in the hands of the males of each tribe. A somewhat similar arrangement is described in the Old Testament book of Numbers.[26] The outcome was that debtors, unable to sell or mortgage their farms, were forced to enter into some kind of proto-feudal relationships with creditors or even sell themselves and their families as slaves. Seisachtheia probably meant that doing so was prohibited.”

“The move did not mean that slavery was abolished. Both Athenian individuals and the state could, and would, continue to own slaves. What changed was the fact that the slaves in question could not be Athenian citizens. From this point on, in other words, all Athenian citizens were, by definition, free”

“To prevent extreme economic inequality from re-emerging, Solon put in place a series of sumptuary laws designed to prevent the rich from flaunting their wealth. An even more important policy was the way he limited the amount of land any single individual was permitted to own. Even so, the danger existed that those who, though freed, had lost their land would now turn into an urban Lumpenproletariat. Evidently it was with this problem in mind that Solon sought to put the economy on a new basis by stimulating industry, trade, shipping, and the circulation of money. Some ancient historians claim that he was also the first to introduce coinage. This is probably false; but there can be no doubt that, to speak with Aristotle, without rough economic equality and a strong middle class, neither Greek democracy nor the polis itself would have been possible”

“Solon took control over the archons away from the Areopagus and handed it to the popular assembly. He may even have given the lowest classes the right to vote, though this is uncertain. He also set up a new body known as the council. It numbered four hundred men and was charged with preparing business for the popular assembly to debate and vote on. In this case, too, it is uncertain whether the members of the lowest classes were allowed to participate.<br>
The net effect was to broaden the basis of government—a clear step towards equality, even though some have argued that Solon’s real purpose was to preserve inequality by granting the lower classes some of their demands.[28]”

“This he did by dividing the citizens into four classes according to the amount of property they owned. The richer any man, the higher the office or offices for which he was eligible; however, the lower classes were still excluded. Having done his work—probably not all at once—Solon, like Lycurgus before him, left the country. Shortly thereafter civil unrest started, ultimately leading to the ascent of a relative of Solon’s, the tyrant Peisistratus. In 527 BC Peisistratus died after a reign of nineteen years, passing power to his son Hippias. In 514 BC, two youths named Harmodius and Aristogeiton killed Hippias. A contemporary inscription praises them for making their country “isonomic,” or legally equal”

“argued that, at this time, isonomia meant no more than equality among aristocrats.[31] Even if that was the case, before long the concept started marching in lockstep with democracy. The next important move in this direction was made by Cleisthenes. With him we enter the great period of Athenian history and its incomparably brilliant achievements in every field of life. Just as the reforms attributed to Solon were probably linked to the emergence of hoplite warfare, so those of Cleisthenes owed much to the development of the Athenian navy and its warships, the famous triremes”

“Triremes required thousands of oarsmen to work them. They could only be recruited among those who had nothing to offer the state except their muscles. In return, they had to be given the vote and admitted into the assembly—if that had not already been accomplished by Solon. The laws prohibiting members of the lower classes from taking up office also went by the board.[32]”

“By redistributing the population according to their place of residence rather than according to the tribes to which they belonged, Cleisthenes also pushed forward the process whereby all citizens were fused into a single body. The Areopagus continued to lose power in favor of the council, the number of whose members Cleisthenes increased to five hundred men. In 462 BC, forty years after Cleisthenes's innovations, the Areopagus was finally deprived of most of its remaining functions at the hands of a radically democratic politician by the name of Ephialtes. Here it is necessary to point out that all this was done neither at once nor easily. Instead the reforms took place amidst ferocious political struggles between “conservative” aristocrats and “progressive” democrats. One of the victims of those struggles was Ephialtes, who was assassinated in 461 BC.”

“Ephialtes’s successor was the great Pericles. Under his leadership, which lasted for some thirty years, Athenian democracy assumed its classic form. One indication of this was the appearance, besides isonomia—formed out of iso, equal, with nomos, meaning usage, custom, or law—of a whole series of closely related concepts. Among them were isogeria, meaning an equal right of all citizens to address the various political assemblies; isophsephos, i.e. one man, one vote; as well as isokratia, or equality of power. Of isonomia itself Herodotus has a Persian nobleman say that it was the “fairest word of all.”[33] Nothing like this democracy had been attempted before. And nothing like it was to be attempted again for many, many centuries to come”

“the Athenians also insisted on isonomia in the sense of equality in front of the law. Both before and since in most polities, different laws were applied to different classes of people. Very often the most powerful people, be they kings or emperors or tyrants, were not subject to any law at all. Not so in classical Athens. In it, absolute obedience to the law was required from all without distinction.<br>
To buttress isonomia still further, people were prohibited from hiring lawyers. While this could not prevent them from having others write their speeches for them, in court they were obliged to represent themselves. The courts’ own impartiality and immunity to bribes was guaranteed by the large number of jurors who looked after each case—as many as 500 or, in the case of the most important lawsuits, 1,000. They too were selected by lot with the aid of an ingenious mechanism specially developed for the purpose.”

“Above all, says Pericles, the Athenian democracy, unlike some other polities, was made up of free men living under their own rule. While guaranteeing equal justice to all citizens, it also enabled those who wanted to do so to serve the state to the limits of their ability.<br>
Taking Cleisthenes’ reforms just before 500 BC as the real starting point, and apart from a brief period around 400 BC, Athenian democracy, and the isonomia on which it was based, lasted until 338 BC. In that year the city was brought under Macedonian control and lost its independence, though for centuries afterwards it did remain a center of learning and culture.”

“During the last twenty-five centuries or so Sparta in general, and the form of equality in which its citizens lived in particular, has had a very mixed press. To Xenophon, an Athenian who spent some time living in Sparta during the first half of the fourth century BC, Lycurgus's laws represented “the utmost limit of wisdom.”[36] He was particularly enamored of the military system. Plato around 400 BC also admired the city, though less for its military prowess than for the kind of socio-economic equality among the homoioi that it provided and which he saw as a prerequisite for both stability and justice. He even used it as a model for the polity he outlined in his greatest masterpiece, The Republic. Plutarch, too, seems to regret its passing away. That is evident not only from his biography of Lycurgus but also from the many exemplary sayings of “true” Spartan men and women he collected in his Moralia.”

“Others were more critical. To recount the opinions of a few of the more famous historians, Herodotus was concerned about the power of the two kings who, unusually for Greek city-states, inherited their positions. In a passage that foreshadows criticisms of equality from his time to the present, he also mentions the “despotism” of the law required to enforce equality and maintain it.[37] Similarly Polybius, the second-century BC Greek historian, has a lot to say about the crimes Nabis committed in his attempt to restore equality to Sparta, when he murdered people right and left.[38] Seventeen hundred years or so later Machiavelli thought that the chief weakness of Sparta, as compared to Rome, was its reluctance, extreme even by Greek standards, to admit foreigners into the citizenry. Yet Machiavelli well understood that keeping foreigners out was an absolute prerequisite for maintaining the kind of equality that existed among the homoioi. Sparta, in other words, was built on a contradiction. It was a contradiction that could only end, and eventually did end, in its downfall.[39]”

“Passing to the Enlightenment, most French and British thinkers rejected Sparta’s militarism. Like Herodotus (and Thucydides) before them, they noted the suppression of the individual by the state, his complete subordination to the demands of the latter, the consequent loss of liberty, and the tendency to neglect of letters and the arts. All of those, of course, were themselves both cause and consequence of the famous Spartan combination of frugality and equality, specifically including equality of wealth.[40] Perhaps surprisingly, in view of his subsequent reputation as the grandfather of both Communism and Fascism, one of those who attacked the Spartan version of equality was the great philosopher Georg Friedrich Hegel (1770-1831). To him it was destructive of the “free individualism” that was, or ought to be, the supreme goal of any polity.[41]”

“Not everybody saw things in this way. To the Abbé Gabriel Bonnot de Mably (1709-85), another well-known author of the time, the economic equality imposed by Lycurgus was meant to create free men. Not in the sense that they were free from the demands of the state, to be sure; but such as would be free from the desire for wealth, thus opening the gates to virtue.[42] Most famous of all was Mably’s close contemporary Rousseau. He used Sparta as a weapon in his lifelong struggle against the inequality he understood as characteristic of the modern world. The Spartans’ forceful words and deeds, he wrote, were preferable to Athenians babblings.[43”

“Addressing the National Assembly in May 1794, Robespierre himself had high praise for Sparta. Amidst a historical background consisting of inequality, selfishness, and greed, he said, “it shines like a star.”[44] This was two months before he was deposed and executed. The list of nineteenth-century public figures who wrote admiringly about Sparta could be continued forever. To many militarists on both sides of the Rhine, the kind of equality the city represented was a necessary, if under modern conditions impractical, prerequisite for recapturing its exceptional prowess at war. Especially in France, however, many republican radicals also upheld it. Continuing where Rousseau had left off, they saw Sparta as the incarnation of civic virtue. Too often, they did not allow the fact that the equality was forced and life itself regimented to the nth degree to disturb them too much.”

“The Nazis, as usual, added a peculiar twist of their own. For them the Athenian version of equality, going hand-in-hand with democracy as it did, was effete and effeminate. Insisting that the Spartans were northern “Dorians,” Third-Reich historians claimed that they maintained their equality, and with it their greatness (as long as it lasted) by rigorously excluding the members of inferior races and refusing to mix with them in any way.[45] The homoioi, in other words, were a model. The helots deserved to be treated like dogs, enslaved, exploited, and even killed. In all this the Nazis took the opposite line from Machiavelli. Arguably they made their country share Sparta’s fate by leading it into a war against the entire world; one which, however excellent their armed forces, owing to their lack of numbers they could not win.”

“In the case of Sparta, critics’ views concerning the homoioi, the kind of life they led and the price they paid, tend to be overshadowed by their attitudes to the city-state’s militarism and prowess in war. Whether or not we agree that the city enjoyed eunomia, “good laws,” Spartan equality was of the kind that usually prevails inside an armed camp. Personal freedom did not exist. Everyone was elevated or, depending on one’s point of view, reduced to a common denominator. It certainly did not open a path towards democracy; politically speaking, equal rights did not prevail. By contrast, opinions surrounding Athenian equality are always hard to separate from those concerning its democracy. Already with Herodotus, the two have often been identified, even confused, with one another. In Athens equality led to and implied democracy, while democracy in turn promoted equality.”

“Foreshadowing Anatole France’s quip that “the law in its majestic equality prohibits both rich and poor from sleeping under the bridges and stealing bread,” several ancient writers criticized the Athenian kind of equality for not going far enough. Especially prominent were Phaleas of Chalcedon and Hippodamus of Miletus. Both wrote during the last decades of the fifth century BC. Phaleas, who is only known to us from Aristotle, pointed out that, though a sort of civic and political equality had been achieved, socio-economic gaps had not been closed. Inequality in these fields was the inevitable result of a society which, forsaking agriculture and the system whereby each man had his own lot of land and provided for his own family, engaged in industry and trade instead”

“Hence he proposed all artisans be reduced into public slaves, which would also result in their removal from the body of citizens. Two other reforms would complete the picture. The first was the gradual redistribution of landed property by regulating dowries in such a way that the poor would only be allowed to receive them, and the rich, to give them. The second, which may have been borrowed from Sparta, was the same education for everyone;[46] but for this, all other kinds of equality would be meaningless.”

“Much better known than Phaleas was Hippodamus of Miletus, an architect who was said to have originated the gridiron plan for cities. Even today, his work may still be seen in the streets of the Athenian suburb of Piraeus. As is also the case in many American towns today, the plan reflected the wish to maintain a certain kind of equality among the inhabitants. Hippodamus too sought to correct the socio-political imbalance by imposing a form of communal ownership. The difference was that the citizen body, and thus the right to both to enjoy civil rights and to participate in politics, would remain intact. Land, still considered the most important resource of all, was to be owned by the community”

“Part of it would be dedicated to the gods, part would support the soldiers, and part feed the farmers.[47] To this Aristotle responded, with good reason, that Hippodamus had neglected to say who would work the soldiers’ land. Moreover, a functional separation between soldiers and farmers would never work. There was, in the plan, nothing to prevent the former from dominating the latter.”

“Fourth-century BC members of the Cynic (from kynos, dog) school also hoped to establish equality by abolishing property. However, theirs was the equality of the mendicant and the beggar who owns nothing and has nothing to lose. As one of them, Diogenes, the philosopher who lived in a barrel and asked Alexander to move aside so as not to obstruct the sun, said, men should be distinguished from one another only by their virtue and by nothing else.[48] The outcome would have been the dismantlement of the polis, indeed of any kind of organized polity. That was something the Cynics realized and even looked forward to.[49]”

“Other critics still, notably Thucydides, took the opposite tack. To them, the trouble with democracy and the isonomia with which it was largely synonymous was that they went much too far. To use Plutarch’s excellent metaphor, what was wrong with Athens was that it lacked a steadying “keel.” In its absence the assembly, largely made up of people who were without property and easily swayed by demagogues, veered now in one direction, now in another. It always risked going to extremes. As many incidents during the Peloponnesian War in particular illustrated, a sane, balanced, continuous policy was very hard, perhaps impossible, to devise and maintain.”

“The greatest critic of all was Plato. He differed from the rest in that he looked at the question from both sides at once. On one hand he shared the idea, very widespread at the time, that economic inequality would necessarily lead to conflict, perhaps civil war, and suggested that it be abolished. His class of guardians was to hold everything, including even their wives and children, in common so that the distinction between “mine” and “thine” would disappear. Only thus could a truly united city be built. Yet Plato’s guardians were to be sharply distinguished both from the workers below them and the philosopher-ruler(s) by whom they were led. Whatever the precise arrangements, and they are anything but clear, obviously there was to be no equality in either rights, or duties, or function. Indeed the whole thing was to be based on a “noble lie:” namely, that the division into classes was not artificial but nature-made.[50]”

“Plato, an aristocrat if ever one there was, also joined Thucydides in criticizing the other side of democracy. That included its “feverish” nature, its encouragement of unrestricted competition among individual (and equal) citizens, and its inability to keep a steady course. Indeed he compared the ruler in a democracy to a trainer in charge of some big and dangerous beast. To avoid being eaten, he is forever forced to follow the beast’s every whim.[51]”

“we cannot trace all the things that have been said about the Greek version of equality from antiquity to the present. It is, however, worth pointing out that ancient critics were interested mainly in what equality did to those who had it. Either they argued that it did not go far enough, or else that it gave rise to certain problems, or both. By contrast, much of modern, particularly liberal and socialist, criticism focused on how exclusive Greek equality was. In Sparta only a small and diminishing fraction of the population consisted of homoioi. In Athens equality probably covered more people—perhaps 40,000, or sixteen percent, in a population estimated at a quarter million”

“Slaves, both state- and privately-owned, had hardly any rights at all. Though Solon did much to make Athens more egalitarian, he also passed a law against slaves practicing gymnastics.[52] Everywhere women were perpetual wards; unattached widows and courtesans apart, they could only live under male protection.”

“Concerning the first and the second of these groups, no ancient writer seems to have suggested that the situation was unjust and that they be incorporated into the citizen-body. To the extent that this was in fact done, not only in Sparta but in other cities too, it was the result of dire necessity. At times it brought the polities in question to the verge of civil war. With women the situation was different. Here and there, the possibility of giving women equal rights became the subject of discussion. One of those involved was the great comic playwright Aristophanes. In his play Ecclesiazusae, “Women in the Assembly,” he portrayed an imaginary polis run by women on behalf of women.”

“Probably Aristophanes’ purpose in writing the play was to criticize the idea of equality, women's equality included, by pushing it to absurd lengths. However, we do not really know.”

“Plato, too, discussed the emancipation of women at some length. To enable women to participate in the affairs of the polis on an equal basis and play their part as guardians, he suggested that they be given an education similar to that of men. Like so many subsequent feminists, he also wanted to see them “liberated” from the need to look after their children. Probably he saw such arrangements as just, useful, and even essential, though utopian. In the end, however, no Greek polis ever turned women into citizens, let alone extended equality to the point where they would be equal with men.”

“When Aristotle sent his students to collect the “constitutions,” or politeai, of no fewer than 158 cities, what he meant was not merely the political framework but the way their social, cultural and even religious lives was organized. Had the material survived, it would have provided a matchless picture of every aspect of Greek civilization in every significant polis—but unfortunately only the volume dealing with Athens remains.”

“Greece was not the only place where city-states, meaning in this context independent, urbanized settlements, rose and developed. Others appeared in the ancient Middle East, Asia—primarily along the Silk Road—and Meso-America. Most were ruled by hereditary chiefs or petty monarchs. The book of Joshua mentions dozens of them, each ruled by a melech (king, in Hebrew). In respect to equality they do not seem to have differed significantly from the chiefdoms we have discussed. A few developed more egalitarian systems. The Old Testament mentions Philistine office-holders called sranim.[1] It has been suggested that the Greeks of 800 BC may have been familiar with the organization of the seafaring Phoenician city-states on the coast of what is Lebanon today and derived some of their political ideas from them.[2] However, so little is known about the city-states in question that the matter must remain uncertain.”

“Much later Carthage, itself a Phoenician city, had a sort of Senate as well as magistrates called suffettes. However, the right to elect and be elected seems to have been limited to the members of a wealthy aristocracy.[3] Carthage may have had the potential to turn itself into a different and much larger kind of polity. However, since it was defeated and destroyed by Rome, which also wiped out any literary sources its enemy may have produced, we shall never know. All other city-states, by refusing to extend citizenship and accept outsiders on an equal basis, remained rather small. Many probably did not have more than a few hundred citizens. Sooner or later they fell victim to polities that, organized on different principles, were much larger than themselves. The one exception to the rule was Rome. The”

“Rome did not follow either the Spartan or the Athenian trajectory towards greater equality among its citizens. Instead, for some four and a half centuries after the abolition of the monarchy it remained what one can only call an aristocratic republic.<br>
The republic in question knew neither the Spartan principle of socio-economic equality nor the Athenian one, of which Pericles had boasted, of isonomia. Instead, the population was divided into three classes, i.e. the Senators, the Knights, and the common people. Membership in the upper classes was based on descent and property. Moral conduct also counted for something”

“The political differences between the classes were, if anything, even more important. Like the Greek city-states, the Roman republic was governed by elected magistrates who served for one year. As in the Greek city-states, it was the assembled people who elected them. It was the assembled people, too, who made the most important decisions, including the passing of legislation and declaring war and peace. In fact Rome had not one but two, later three, different popular assemblies. In the two oldest of those, the comitia tributa and the comitia centuriata, citizens did not vote as individuals but by the tribe or century to which they belonged”

“At present, expressions such as “aristocratic republic” smack of exclusiveness and that worst of all bad things, unequal rights. Many ancient historians, particularly Polybius and Livy who in this respect were following Aristotle, saw things in a different light. They thought that Rome's “mixed constitution,” consisting of monarchic, aristocratic and democratic elements, served to restrain all three and prevent them from being carried to excesses. Far from being a handicap, the constitution represented the real secret of the city’s exceptional success”

“Throughout the second century BC socio-economic inequality had increased. The countless wars Rome fought, the enormous demands those wars made on the available manpower, and the uneven distribution of the vast amounts of booty that flowed into the city were the primary causes. As a few became fabulously wealthy, many grew much poorer than they had been. They were forced to sell their land to the owners of the great estates and move into the city where they became a shiftless proletariat. During the 130s these problems for the first time gave rise to serious political trouble which grew into a whole series of civil wars”

“In Rome and other empires, some emperors did their best to impose justice. A stele erected by one of the earliest emperors, the “god-chosen” Hammurabi around 1772 BC, says that the objective of issuing a code of law was to ensure that the strong would not oppress the weak.[9] Still the code, and many similar ones, drew very sharp distinctions between noblemen and commoners, commoners and slaves, and also between men and women. In the case of murder, the amount of blood money required to be paid therefore varied accordingly”

“Only in two respects did equality prevail in Rome. First, adherents of the Stoic school of philosophy asserted the natural equality of all human beings. All, slaves included, had sprung from the same stock. They lived under the same skies, had the same biological makeup and needs, and were equal under natural law.[10] There was nobody so low born, so degraded, that he (or she) was incapable ab initio of being virtuous.[11] People should remember this and try to assist each other and treat each other as kindly as circumstances permitted. However, Stoics never made any kind of organized attempt to tear down existing political, social and economic inequalities. How could they, given that they tended to be upper class men with an emperor, Marcus Aurelius, at their head?”

“One of the most important and long-lived official ideologies that underpinned government and justified the unequal power that some people exercised over others was Chinese Confucianism. Unlike most other civilizations, China did not have a supreme god. In some sense, indeed, it did not have any gods at all. As a result, instead of claiming to be descended from the supreme god, Chinese emperors carried the title Son of Heaven (Tien) and claimed to rule over All under Heaven. The way Confucius described the universe, all the inhabitants of All under Heaven were part of a single, though vast, family. Inside that family, everyone and everything had its place which was also mandated by Heaven. Moderns were duty-bound to respect ancients, inferiors, superiors, youngsters their elders and women, men.[20] All these obligations were supposed to be reciprocal. In return for being revered, served and fed, superiors owed inferiors guidance, protection, and benevolence”

“In this system the central value was harmony, not equality. Social life was to be based on the recognition that all people (and, according to some of the master’s followers, all things, but that is less important for our purpose) have their proper station in life. They should be treated, and should treat others, accordingly. In this sense, indeed, harmony was consciously meant as a substitute for the inequality nature had created and which was an essential prerequisite for any civilization. Laws, or rather codes of conduct, were not formalized but had to be planted in the people’s hearts and minds instead. The means for doing so were goodwill, example and education, not prohibitions and punishments. This in turn reflected the belief that everybody, however low his or her position in life, had the potential to become virtuous. In this sense at any rate, everyone had indeed been born equal to everybody else.”

“Not everyone was happy with this way of looking at things. On one side of Confucianism was Daoism. Like Confucianism, it can be seen as a religion, a philosophy, or both.[24] Also like Confucianism, it opposed written laws—“too many laws make the empire decline.” It differs in that it puts the individual, not the community, at the center of things. It recognizes that different people have different ways of attaining Dao, meaning “the proper path,” “excellence,” or “a state in which the gap between the existing and the desirable is closed.”

“To be sure, the rights, tasks and duties of the king were very different from those of the commoner. Still, and it is here that Daoism and Confucianism differ, everyone is theoretically able to achieve his Dao without reference to anyone else. In this sense all are equal. The Daoist hero, if that is not an oxymoron, is the perfectly self-contained individual. At the same time, so attuned is he to the world that he achieves everything without doing anything.”

“Such a doctrine is not easy to reconcile with the existence of a system of government based on inequality. Both within and without China it could be used, and occasionally has been used, to deny the need for any government at all.[25] Hence it is not surprising that we find, on Confucius’ other side, the so-called “legalist” tradition. Once again, the background is formed by the Period of the Warring States. Here the emphasis is on avoiding chaos and maintaining order. This is to be achieved by means of powerful laws known as fa. The Emperor must have them written down and applied to all his subjects equally.[26”

“Except that there is no personal god, we are back with Hammurabi and countless similar despots. Their common goal was to raise themselves so high above all the rest that they could treat them, or tread on them, as equals—an idea, of course, that was rarely if ever realized in practice.”

“early Christian congregations formed small, powerless minorities in a pagan sea. They drew their members mainly from the lower classes and were as egalitarian as any communities have ever been. Some even adopted a communist lifestyle including common property, common living quarters, common meals, and in the catacombs, common burials and common graves.[28] The Apostle Paul regularly addressed his letters to entire communities, not to specific people within them. Furthermore, during the first three centuries Christians were often severely persecuted. Always fearing to be betrayed as Jesus himself was, leaders could exercise influence but had to tread very carefully when wielding authority.”

“Later things changed. In heaven, the saints were carefully graded according to their importance. Here on earth, once the Church had emerged from the underground and was officially recognized as the carrier of the state religion it lost no time in building an enormously elaborate hierarchy that consisted of patriarchs, hegemons, cardinals, archbishops, bishops, deacons, and a whole host of less important dignitaries. Each of them occupied a different rank, possessed different powers, and enjoyed different privileges”

“Moslem rulers resembled Jewish and Christian rulers in that they could not be gods. However, just as their Greek Orthodox counterparts were heads of the eastern Church, they could very well be Caliphs (heads of the faithful). Islam was at first a tribal religion. While Mohammed led his “Companions” (Ansar) it is important to recall that he was a refugee who had been forced to flee his native city of Mecca. As a result, all he could rely upon were example and persuasion, not formal authority. Yet even the Quran itself contains several verses that prohibit believers from questioning social inequalities, claiming that they were instituted by Allah in person.[29] Whether these are later interpolations, as some scholars believe they are, will not be discussed here. What is indisputable is that, once Islamic expansion had begun in earnest, things changed. Moslem rulers, running a huge empire, took over or developed much more hierarchical structures than those their people had previously possessed.[30]”

“Nevertheless there have always been some Islamic voices suggesting equality. Much the most important form remained equality before God, which few doubted. Inside the mosque every man had to prostrate himself just like everyone else. Arguably this form of equality was of great assistance in enabling Islam to penetrate the extremely un-egalitarian societies of India and West Africa, regions where it established a permanent, and in the eyes of many very troublesome, presence. Islamic scholars also considered equality before the law and socio-economic equality. On occasion, even the possibility of granting equality to Jews and Christians (dhimmi) and women was debated. Some medieval scholars may have been influenced by Plato whose works reached them in more or less faithful, more or less abbreviated, translations.[31] Few if any of these ideas were ever realized in practice. Rather, as was also the case among Christians, equality before God served as an excuse not to institute it on earth”

“It is, however, necessary to add that the Moslem clergy, or ulama, remained surprisingly egalitarian. Caliphs might be the successors of Mohammed and the heads of the faithful. However, they were not religious scholars. Society did recognize that some scholars were better than others. Their reward was to receive more elevated titles, to become better known, and to attract more students. Some Islamic scholars served as judges, but it was the secular authorities who appointed them and controlled them. Even Shiites, who are more inclined to grade such scholars than Sunnis are, did not develop the formal organization, i.e. a church, needed for one Ayatollah to force his views on all the rest. That only happened in Iran after the fall of the Shahanasha (“King of Kings”) in 1978 when the country became an Islamic Republic. In that form of republic, the religious establishment is superior to the secular one rather than vice versa”

“Regardless of just how they themselves were, or were not, related to God, and also of how egalitarian the various religions and doctrines were, rulers in all the empires listed above resembled Caligula in that their power was absolute. Conversely, subjects had no rights whatsoever. In a very real sense they were the rulers’ slaves. To the sixteenth-century French political scientist Jean Bodin, that fact was precisely why the Ottoman Empire had grown as powerful as it was. In most places, so far did an emperor stand above other mortals that they were expected to approach him while crawling on their bellies as if they were worms or ants. In ancient Persia, anybody who so much as accidentally touched him was, unless clemency was exercised, executed on the spot. By agreeing to her kinsmen’s request that she speak to Asahuerus (Xerxes) without asking for permission first, Esther, who was his favorite concubine, put her life in jeopardy.[32]”

“In the Arthashastra, one of the most sophisticated political treatises ever which was allegedly written by Kautilya (ca. 350-283 BC) as a guide to the rulers of the Mauryan Empire, equality is not even mentioned.”

“Inside each hierarchy there was a constant jockeying for power. In the end, everything depended on getting the emperor’s ear. In many places independently rich and influential people who were not a part of the imperial hierarchy did indeed exist. However, being outsiders, their position was often as precarious as that of the hierarchy’s members, if not more so.<br>
In one way or another, all these problems were duplicated by the empires’ smaller relatives, i.e. kingdoms and chiefdoms. What really set empires apart was the fact that their heads’ pretensions to supremacy (in other words, their unequal status), went far beyond their own territories. The aforementioned Hammurabi claimed to rule the entire earth. His Assyrian and Persian successors made the same claim. Somewhere along the way they also invented the title King of Kings. Roman and Byzantine emperors claimed to rule the oikoumene, or inhabited world, even though they knew quite well that, in reality, that was not the case”

“Medieval Holy Roman Emperors claimed to be the heads of the Respublica Christiana, if not the entire world.<br>
These claims often resulted in strange incidents. Visiting Paris in 1377, Emperor Charles IV mounted the white horse reserved for King Charles V of France without asking for permission first, even though France was not part of the his empire. No wonder that in a contemporary illustration, the king looks annoyed.[33] A Japanese delegation visiting Beijing did not pay the emperor the respect the latter claimed was his due. Loath to break relations, he generously “forgave them” for their ignorance.”

“Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent issued a proclamation saying that King Francis I of France had prostrated himself in front of his throne (in reality, he had suggested an alliance). Ivan the Terrible of Russia called Queen Elizabeth I of England “a mere maiden.”[34] Yet the claim of absolute superiority was far from being a harmless quirk. It meant that anyone who elected to wage war, even a defensive war, against an emperor was, by definition, a rebel and treated accordingly. How many millions paid with their lives for this idea is impossible to say.”

“As we saw, the very fact that city-states rested on citizen-bodies whose members were, in some important ways, each other's equals formed a formidable obstacle to their unification and expansion. No group has ever been eager to share its privileges with others; as a result, in most cases those obstacles remained insurmountable. Empires, being based on inequality, even if it was only a “soft” inequality dressed in Confucian etiquette, did not suffer from this disadvantage to nearly the same extent. From antiquity down to quite recent times, in principle and very often in practice they were able to swallow up many smaller polities, city-states included, and incorporate many peoples without having to worry about this aspect of the problem.”

“An empire might be defined as a polity that, precisely because it was not rooted in equality, was able to do all those things. But for inequality, most empires could hardly have become what they were.”

“To be sure, there was a price to be paid. Everywhere superiors, regardless of whether it was by status, religion or nationality that they differed from subordinates, had to devote a considerable part of their resources to holding them in their proper place. When that effort failed, as it notoriously did in the case of the Aztec, Inca, and Mughal empires, the entire elaborate structure came crashing down like a house of cards. Not so long ago the same happened first to the various European colonial empires and then to the Soviet Union. Yet considering how mighty some empires became, and how long they lasted, it seems to have been a price they were well able to bear”

“Not every empire or kingdom succeeded in preserving its centralized structure over extended periods. Partly this was because distances were often very great and communications,very poor. To relay information from the capital to the frontier and back might take weeks or more.[35] To assemble an army and march it to a trouble spot took considerably longer still. As a result, provincial governors and officials could not be strictly controlled. The point might come where they were able to leave their positions to their offspring. Understood as a political concept, feudalism was invented during the Enlightenment.”
