Scott (2016) How Can Cryptocurrency and Blockchain Technology play a role in building social and solidarity finance
</p>

<br>
<br>

<p>
\citep{Scott2016}
</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li>the discussion paper provides a primer on the basics of Bitcoin and discusses the existent narratives about the technology's potential to facilitate remittances, financial inclusion, cooperative structures and even micro-insurance systems</li>
<li>flags up potential points of concern and conflict, such as tech-from-above "solutionism" and conservative libertarian political dynamics of some of the technology start-up community that surrounds bitcoin</li>
<li>considers "Blockchain 2.0" technologies with more overtly communitarian ideals</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
1
</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li>bitcoin's image tarnished by association with speculators, profit-driven entrepreneurs, market-fundamentalist libertarians and technology fetisishts (Yelowitz and Wilson 2015)</li>
<li>the question whether Bitcoin can be used to empower marginalized communities and build new means of solidarity-based finance remain unanswered</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
The original Bitcoin community made much out of the "trustless" nature of the technology (Miscione and Kavanagh 2015) ... but newer groups are expanding the vision into one of trust-enabling decentralized cooperatives, or "distributed collaborative organizations".
</p>

<p>
The normal transaction system:
</p>

<p>
<ol type="1" start="1">
<li>A person has an account number at a bank.</li>
<li>They have a way of proving that they control that account number, e.g. a PIN code</li>
<li>The bank, in turn, has a data record of how much money is attributable to that account number, thereby keeping score of the person's money on a private internal database or ledger</li>
<li>The person can then use an electronic communications system to id themselves to their bank as the authentic account holder, and can request for the money associated with their account number to be transferred to someone else's account at a different bank.</li>
<li>This then spurs the bank to edit their ledger of accounts - changing the person's score - and to tell the recipient's bank to do the same. </li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
The bitcoin system: the two immediate differences are that 1) the database that is used to record payments between people is public, rather than the privately held account databases of the normal banking system, and 2) the intermediaries that change that database are a decentralized network of people ("miners") running special Bitcoin software, rather than banks running their own private software system
</p>

<p>
(All transactions can be seen by everyone, but attributing a specific person's identity to any particular transaction is difficult)
</p>

<p>
In the Bitcoin system:
</p>

<p>
<ol type="1" start="1">
<li>A person wishing to make a payment has a public address (akin to an account number)</li>
<li>They have a way of controlling that public address through the use of a private key (roughly akin to a PIN number)</li>
<li>They then use an electronic communications system (the internet) to identify themselves to the Bitcoin network, and request that digital tokens - associated with their public address - be moved to someone else's public address</li>
<li>This then occurs by a change made to the blockchain ledger by a set of participants colloquially known as miners. The process involves the miners using their computing power to validate the transactions.</li>
<li>The two parties who control the public addresses can then see these changes, proving that the tokens have moved from one address to the other.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
... To get such tokens into such a central economic position [as enjoyed by the U.S. Dollar] does not come easily - it involves deep interplays between state power, central banks, commercial banks, institutions that protect property title, and the redeemability of legal tender to pay taxes and other debts - but once a monetary standard is established it is very difficult to dislodge.
</p>

<p>
Bitcoin, by contrast to a token like the South African rand, has no geographically and politically discreet real economy in which it is dominant. It thus does not tend to be a primary unit of pricing in any economy - very few vendors explicitly price their goods in terms of Bitcoin as a unit of account - and it is also not widely perceived as a means of exchange. Thus, while it has the potential to be a currency unit, in practice few people actually use, or perceive, Bitcoin as money in the traditional sense.
</p>

<p>
4
</p>

<p>
...digital tokens have a perceived value contingent upon their specialized usage among specialized communities, and that the construction of this perceived value is an ongoing process that develops as more players get involved.
</p>

<h3>Narratives of cryptocurrency empowerment</h3>

<br>

<p>
<b>5</b>
</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li>a number of narratives about why bitcoin may be empowering for people in less developed countries (in the context of international development, financial inclusion and bottom-of-the-pyramid business) has emerged</li>
<li>these include:
<ul>
<li>Bitcoin as a means to facilitate low-cost remittances for those seeking to transfer small amounts of money internationally</li>
<li>Bitcoin as a means for an otherwise excluded individual to have a decentralized global bank account, accessible simply by downloading an open source wallet from the internet, rather than having to set up with a formal financial institution</li>
<li>Bitcoin- or the technology that underpins it - subsequently providing the basis for a richer set of financial services</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li>remittances under threat as existing systems are being shut down due to concerns that they are financing terrorists</li>
<li>bitcoin has potential to facilitate small-scale international commerce</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
6
</p>

<p>
As of yet, however, there appears to be little robust empirical evidence on the extent to which such use of Bitcoin is occurring. There are many anecdotal examples, but no systematic studies beyond proxy studies of Bitcoin users. (See Yelowitz and Wilson 2015, Bohr and Bashir 2014, Hernandez et al. 2014)
</p>

<h4>Quasi-bank account for the "unbanked"</h4>

<br>

<p>
<ul>
<li>bitcoin as a decentralized bank</li>
<li>has potential to complement, or compete with, mobile banking applications such as M-PESA in Kenya</li>
<li>but the politics of mobile banking are tricky, and in Nigeria for example banks have succeeded in lobbying to permit only banks operate mobile money services</li>
<li>bitcoin could bypass this</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li>bitcoin as <b>replacement</b> currency in countries with unstable national currencies</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Hileman (2015): Bitcoin Market Potential Index<br>
<ul>
<li>lists Argentina, Venezuela and Zimbabwe as the countries with citizens most likely to adopt Bitcoin in the future</li>
<li>needs only to be <b>relatively</b> safer than the national currency</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
7
</p>

<h4>Counter-narratives</h4>

<br>

<p>
<ul>
<li>pushback from conservatives who suggest bitcoin-based systems will be used for money laundering and financing terrorists (Fernholz 2015) </li>
<li>Higgins (2015): Hacking Team, a producer of government surveillance spyware, was working on cracking Bitcoin systems on behalf of government clients</li>
<li>Market factors for remittances: there needs to be liquid market between bitcoin and the currency of the recipient's country
<ul>
<li>this can be difficult</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>mobile money succeeded partly because it leveraged an existing network of vendors and agents; Bitcoin does not obviate the need to build extensive network of agents in remote locations to give people cash in exchange of bitcoin remittances</li>
<li>there remain doubts about the viability of Bitcoin within countries with poor infrastructure and technology access
<ul>
<li>issue of establishing trust in an otherwise poorly understood digital token system</li>
<li>consistent internet availability and efficient electric grids needed</li>
<li>ideally, wide availability of smart phones</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>merely providing the potential for a Bitcoin account and payments service does not deeply address the problem of financial exclusion</b>
<ul>
<li>exclusion generally means not having access to credit, which may be related to not having stable income streams, or access to formal property titles to act as collateral</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
8
</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li>financial inclusion likely needs to look beyond profit and to create financial institutions built on social and solidarity principles</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>Techno-Colonial Solutionism from Above?</h3>

<br>

<p>
<ul>
<li>more political critique</li>
<li>"escape to the internet" rather than seeking more fundamental solutions to a country's underlying problems on the ground</li>
<li>adopting Bitcoin is at best likely a short-term solution</li>
<li>at worst, it distracts countries from strengthening already fragile institutions</li>
<li>escaping may help individual people, but does little to empower the broader social majority who remain reliant on the existing systems</li>
<li>those most likely to escape are usually social elites</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li>the apolitical "solutionist" lens shows the world as a series of things that have been solved and things that remain to be solved with technology-driven enterprises</li>
<li>this technology-as-a-saviour narrative is essentially top-down in nature</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
9
</p>

<p>
Technology solutionism can be contrasted to more holistic anthropological perspectives concerned with understanding the socially embedded use of technology in particular political and cultural settings. 
</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li>is financial exclusion really an unfortunate and avoidable problem in search of a profitable technological solution, or is it an integral part of an unequal economic system?</li>
<li>Should the end goal really be to bring marginalized people into the normal financial markets, or should the focus be on creting meaningful alternative institutions based on principles of social solidarity?</li>
<li>right now, much of the bitcoin community appears ambivalent about where they stand on that. </li>
<li><b>Bitcoin certainly is an alternative, but is it just an alternative way of doing business-as-usual?</b></li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>Forking critique: alternative cryptocurrencies</h3>

<br>

<p>
<ul>
<li>slightly different versions of bitcoin (Ong et al. 2015)</li>
<li>e.g. Freicoin introduced inflation ("demurrage") into the system</li>
<li>however, cryptocurrencies in general have become associated with free-market thought
<ul>
<li>particularly the hyper-individualism of conservative libertarianism</li>
<li>some adherents see cryptocurrency as a mroe efficient means to facilitate trade within a pure capitalist model (Golumbia 2015)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Such champions of cryptocurrency may argue that the financial sector rips off customers, but rather than viewing this as a normal feature of profit-driven business within a naturally political marketplace (constructed over time in incremental fashion by politicized human institutions), the problem is often seen to be the infringement of the political into an imagined apolitical (and ahistorical) realm of the market: banks are abusive because they are too intertwined with the political system, which stymies the workings of what would otherwise be a neutral free-market. The way to solve this is thus to disintermediate them via apolitical cryptocurrency technology.
</p>

<p>
10
</p>

<p>
To those with a more left-wing libertarian impulse, though, cryptocurrency is interesting because it has features that potentially allow for non-hierarchal self-organization and peer-to-peer collaboration within a communitarian network structure. There are thus emergent attempts to build cryptocurrencies that can be used as a means of exchange for explicitly cooperative and collaborative enterprises that exist outside the logic of normal market processess (see De Filippi 2015).
</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li>example: Faircoin</li>
<li>approach runs contrary to many financial inclusion narratives that suggest that economic inequality is due to external factors that stymie the efficient workings of markets and therefore create market failures
<ul>
<li>e.g. market-based approach may identify poorly defined property rights as a cause of market exclusion</li>
<li>the solution is to extend the market system into areas where they do not currently operate well, in the theory that this will give individuals within that situation a better chance of competing within the normal market</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>in a project like faircoin, the starting assumption is that while formal market systems may be a source of economic growth and individual enhancement, they are simultaneously the source of social inequality, individual alienation and community disintegration</li>
<li>thus, such projects seek to create alternative economic systems that bypass normal markets, and rewrite the deep level rules of economic engagement</li>
<li>particularly heavy emphasis on the basis of economic life being mutual cooperation and solidarity, rather than individual competition for narrow economic success</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li>interesting part of cryptocurrency element here is that traditionally, autonomist communities have often retreated to small-scale localism as a means to foster close human relationships</li>
<li>the vision of projects such as Faircoin is to build large-scale networks of solidarity-based collaboration using technology</li>
<li>potentially enabling "collaboration at scale" - this is what cryptocurrency technology can do for radical economic alternatives</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>

</p>

<h3>Blockchain 2.0 Technology</h3>

<br>

<p>
<ul>
<li>cryptocurrencies subject to all manner of ideological battles</li>
<li>however, most interested parties agree that the underlying concept of a <b>decentralized public ledger, collectively maintained by a network of participants</b> is very important</li>
<li>sharing diverse data:
<ul>
<li>property titles, contracts, shares (Lee 2015)</li>
<li>voting decisions (Noizat 2015)</li>
<li>reputation scores (Scott 2015b)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>smart contracts, see Wright and De Filippi 2015
<ul>
<li>simple insurance contract (Mainelli and Von Gunten 2014)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>DAOs (Pangburn 2015)
<ul>
<li>DAOs are essentially advanced multi-stage algorithms held in play on a decentralized network of computers, rather than controlled by a single management team</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>many with free-market orientation have been interested in using blockchain to indelibly record property rights (Williams 2015)</li>
<li>Honduras deal in 2015: see Chavez-Dreyfus 2015)</li>
<li>likened to the ultimate way of fulfilling Hernando de Soto's vision of building strong property rights in informal economies (Forbes 2015)</li>
<li>but do blockchain registries necessarily solve the underlying problems?</li>
<li>in places where land titles are uncertain, the institutions tend to be weak to give rise to uncertainty in the first place</li>
<li>merely presenting a technology does little unless there are strong legal institutions that recognize the recorded blockchain claims, and strong procerdures in place for who gets to make the claims</li>
</ul>

<h3>Techno-libertarian Evangelism?</h3>

<br>

<p>
<ul>
<li>the presence of blockchain "missionaries" in developing countries artticulating a technology-as-saviour and markets-as-saviour gospel alongside an anti-state message</li>
<li>e.g. in Ghana a group called Africa Youth Peace Call (see. <a href="www.cryptocoinsnews.com/liberating-northern-ghana-block-chain-model-africa/" title="www.cryptocoinsnews.com/liberating-northern-ghana-block-chain-model-africa/" class="http">www.cryptocoinsnews.com/liberating-northern-ghana-block-chain-model-africa/</a>) organized a 2015 Blockchain Land Title Summer Liberty and Entrepreneurship Camp to discuss land registry
<ul>
<li>group's stated objective is in "teaching free-market ideas and skills to the people of Africa"</li>
<li>despite appearing as a Ghanainan organization, most of the group's board are foreigners, including American free-market economists Ken Schoolland, Warren Coats and Louis JAmes, and libertarian activist Michael W. Dean</li>
<li>camp attendees included the outspoken American libertarian activist and investor Roger Ver</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</p>

</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li>camp also attended by Bitnation, a group offering one of the most radical articulations of the techno-libertarian message</li>
<li>Their vision of a "market in governance services" only holds together if it is assumed that markets can exist <b>prior </b>to political governance systems
<ul>
<li>this is in contrats to those who argue that markets themselves are underpinned by political governance systems that uphold the property rights that enable them to exist in the first place</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</p>

<br>

<p>
<ul>
<li>"coded governance" (Wood and Buchanan 2015)</li>
<li>Visions of a Techno-Leviathan (Scott 2015a) 
<ul>
<li>this essay argues that the most ardent blockchain proponents often present, advertently or inadvertently, a dim vision of human nature, suggesting that people need to be protected from themselves by deferring responsibility to "trustless" technological platforms that will enforce contract-based relationships between atomistic individuals in an escape from community</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>The emancipatory Potential: Collaboration at Scale?</h3>

<br>

<p>
<ul>
<li>there is a nascent trend, found within groups like Swarm, Blockstream and Ethereum, to de-emphasize the focus on the trustless nature of blockchains, and <b>instead characterize blockchain technology as trust-enabling.</b>
<ul>
<li>e.g. Blockstream: "transform global systems of value exchange that, by design, make it possible <b>to trust anyone</b>"</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>the idea is that in removing the need to trust central authorities, blockchains could be platforms upon which build new forms of non-hierarchical cooperation between strangers</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li>the political dynamics of, and ambiguity within, the term "trust:"
<ul>
<li>normally, interpersonal trust built through close personal contact</li>
<li>in its absence, such trust may be low</li>
<li>if, however, the need to build close personal relationships prior to trusting someone is removed, it may be possible to extend a form of - perhaps impoersonal - trust to those you do not know</li>
<li>in most modern societies this already extensively occurs through the use of formal centralized authorities and formal legal contract systems</li>
<li>"detached form of trust in the consumer protection laws"</li>
<li>institutional trust</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li>all trust-transmitting mechanisms have the potential to both atomize and disconnect people from each other (e.g. money), but also to enable new exchanges and transactions that would not have happened otherwise (e.g. buying something from someone we don't know)</li>
<li>by removing a source of potential tension between strangers, money might even lay the groundwork for a pleasant, albeit shallow, relationship</li>
<li>money can be seen as atomizing and alienating, or as trust-enabling between two strangers</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
15
</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li>but to do this, one has to trust the money = trust the state</li>
<li>can state be trusted? Both right- and left-wing extremes believe it cannot be</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h4>Individualistic vs communitarian readings of blockchain technology</h4>

<br>

<p>
<ul>
<li>the original libertarian vision: cryptography-based blockchain would do away with the need for hegemonic central intermediaries that would normally be needed to mediate relations between strangers
<ul>
<li>these are seen as flawed because they are inevitably controleld by untrustworthy and self-interested humans (e.g. politicians, bankers)</li>
<li>this is because untrustworthiness/selfishness is "human nature</li>
<li>if given the chance, all people are seen to abuse all people</li>
<li>in this context, blockchain appears as a way to once and for all resolve the problem of how to establish contractual relationships between untrustworthy human beings who seek out their self-interest</li>
<li>this is the neo-Hobbesian view of a blockchain system as the ultimate and perfected arbiter between individuals who would otherwise be trying to swindle, defraud or damage each other</li>
<li>"techno-leviathan"</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>another reading: communitarian anarchist (social anarchist or libertarian socialist)
<ul>
<li>assert that people get alienated and corrupted within the bureaucratic hierarchies and power dynamics of large-scale capitalist system institutions</li>
<li>anarchist traditions have thus often advocated the need to develop smaller-scale non-hierarchical and solidaryty-based systems where people can experience their social and interdependent nature, and thereby achieve emancipation</li>
<li>Can blockchain systems be a basis upon which people can easily interact with distant strangers for collaboration at scale</li>
<li>superficially at least, blockchain systems offer a vision of large-scale egalitarian self-organization far beyond the scale of ordinary anarchist attempts at building cooperative communes</li>
<li>objective is to replace hierarchal centralized institutions with decentralized ones</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
<ul style='padding-left: 30pt'>
<li>but this is to allow naturally social beings to flourish and collaborate with each other in a spirit of cooperation, not individualistic competition</li>
<li>see Coin Center paper on Distributed Collaborative Organizations (Bollier et al. 2015)
<ul>
<li>describes explicitly collaborative entities that issue blockchain-based shares - or crypto-equity tokens - that give the holders ownership or membership rights in a type of decentralized cooperative</li>
<li>could a city network of informal street vendors run a collective mutual insurance pool between themselves using only their smartphones to interact with a distributed ledger system?</li>
<li>regional mutual credity system?</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</p>

<br>

<h4>The everyday pragmatics of decentralized blockchains</h4>

<br>

<p>
<ul>
<li>the deep question for both individualistic and communitarian poles: how to get people who may be used to existing systems of institutionalised trust to start using another one?</li>
<li>How does a blockchain system gain legitimacy and stability, such that users will adopt it and grow to trust the safety of their position within it?</li>
<li>blockchain systems do not yet offer the protections, basic rights and responsibilities known in the government system</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
For the everyday pragmatic practitioner then, the impulse is to implement blockchain systems very firmly within the existing institutional context of modern nation states and the formal global economy, rather than outside of such systems. 
</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li>second question for communitarian conception in particular: how to scale up cooperation without lapsing back into a bureaucratic, alienating and unaccountable system
<ul>
<li>i.e. how to build decentralized governance systems that give people true voice in the decentralized technology systems</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li>within original bitcoin culture, the governance system, based on open source principles, is basically the one of EXIT: if you don't like it, you can fork the code to create something else
<ul>
<li>the only chance of a voice is if you can influence other developers on the forums and at the conferences</li>
<li>the power dynamics of this process is often glossed over</li>
<li>open source movement often uncritically assumes that everyone has equal power
<ul>
<li>but those with better technical skills or capital tend to dominate apparently open projects</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Indeed, despite being presented as democratic, open source projects have the potential to turn into rigid concretized systems where each individual participant has little power to change anything because there are no clear channels to affect change other than to<br>
17<br>
fork the code and create a competing structure, which is often an unsatisfactory solution. 
</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li>key developers in Bitcoin have effectively become unelected decision makers for all the legacy users</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Hierarchal states and corporations may be imperfect and alienating, but they provide - theoretically at least - formal channels to change things that are not working.
</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li>attempts to scale up anarchist communes through blockchain technology also require the simultaneous creation of decentralized governance systems for individuals to have a voice within the decentralized technology system</li>
<li>FairCoin has been explicitly trying to construct such a system</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>Recommendations for Further Research</h3>

<br>

<p>
<ul>
<li>technology is still new, but it is apparent that there are potentially empowering uses of it in certain contexts</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Nevertheless, while the community around this technology is enthusiastic and experimental, it is still prone towards the elitist, tech-centric outlook of disruptive technology start-up culture.
</p>

<p>
A giood starting point would be to build new research into the following:
</p>

<p>
<ol type="1" start="1">
<li>The ongoing development and deepening of global Bitcoin market, tracing to what erxtent those in developing country contexts are actually adopting it. There is a definite need for baseline studies of usage, against which future changes can be measured.</li>
<li>The challenges and potentials for the Bitcoin system's usage from a financial inclusion perspective. This includes its use as a remittance system and as an alternative bank account. This can be complemented with studies on the extent to which blockchain-based property title systems (such as land registries) have the potential to open up normal bank financing to people who otherwise cannot get access to credit from financial institutions.</li>
<li>The extent to which Bitcoin as a currency system could interact in the future with blockchain 2.0 smart-contract technology to create collectively-run (and solidarity-based) financial schemes that do not rely upon normal financial institutions. Might rural weather insturance systems be build upon mobile phones? Can a farmer's co-operative establish itself via a crypto-equity system?</li>
