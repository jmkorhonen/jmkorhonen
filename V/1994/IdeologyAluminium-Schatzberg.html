<p>
<ul>
<li>our modern culture associates symbolic meanings to materials, and therefore the idea of a wooden airplane is enough to evoke surprise and disbelief</li>
<li>Wood symbolizes preindustrial technologies and craft traditions</li>
<li>Metal represents industrial age, technical progress, and the primacy of science</li>
<li>symbols played a crucial role in the demise of wooden airplane</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Despite the nearly universal belief among aviation engineers in the superiority of metal, wood remained an essential material for aircraft structures into the early 1930s. The persistence of wood was the result, I argue, of the indeterminacy of the technical choice between wood and metal. In the 1920s, the technical evidence favored neither wood nor metal overall. <b>Technical criteria thus cannot explain the aviation community's enthusiastic support for metal construction.</b> In addition to technical arguments, supporters of metal invoked a nontechnical rhetoric that linked metal with progress and wood with stasis. Using this rhetoric, aviation engineers experssed their belief in the inevitable triumph of the metal airplane, a belief I term the <b>progress ideology of metal. This ideology insured that research and development resources went overwhelmingly to improving metal airplanes.</b>
</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li>Standard technical histories of the airplane accept at face value the arguments for inherent superiority of metal</li>
<li>these are classic Whig histories that judge the past in terms of its contribution to the present</li>
<li>their heroes are the pioneers and prophets of the victorious path</li>
<li>these histories do little more than codify the aviation community's own mythology and thus cannot reflect critically on the basic assumptions of that community</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
36
</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li>this is a "symmetrical" account that makes no presumption about the relative merit of the failed and successful technologies (see Pinch 1988, "Understanding Technology: Some Possible Implications of Work in the Sociology of Science", in Technology and Social Process, ed. Brial Elliot. Also Noble, Forces of production: a social history of industrial automation, New York 1984)</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li>wood wing spars were still in wide use in late 1930s</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Dominant technologies often obscure past alternatives, making the chosen path seem the only possible outcome. The rejected alternatives are thought to have failed due to objective technical or economic factors, factors that make the victory of the successful technology appear inevitable. In general, one can counteract this presentist bias through a close examination of technical controversiers, that is, arguments over the alternative paths. But such a strategy is not sufficient in the case of the wooden airplane. <b>Although there was considerable discussion of the relative merits of wood and metal, there was very little debate,</b> if one defines a debate as the presentation of opposing points of view. <b>In most technical discussions of aviation materials, the participants simply posited the superiority of metal.</b> Since I cannot rely on the participants themselves for a balanced assessment, I need to reconstruct the technical comparison of wood and metal, relying only on evidence available to the aviation community at the time. <b>This evidence demonstrates that the choice of airplane materials remained indeterminate during the interwar period: in other words, neither theory nor experience could demonstrate the superiority of metal.</b>
</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li>advocates of metal construction claimed advantages in four main areas: fire safety, weight efficiency, manufacturing costs, and durability</li>
<li>in each of these areas, the claims of the superiority of metal proved equivocal (that is, it wasn't that wood was better, but that the results were not conclusive either way)</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
41
</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li>aluminium construction did not make planes fireproof (fuels were the problem) and metals were heavy for their strength</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
42
</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li>it was very difficult to build a metal wing as light as a wood structure</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
43
</p>

<p>
In a 1929 textbook, Alexander Klemin, a leading aeronautical engineer, estimated that metal wings weighed on average from 25 to 36 percent more than wood wings.
</p>

<p>
45
</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li>buckling a major problem, particularly because weight of metal necessitated the use of thin plates</li>
<li>in a 1942 textbook a professor of aeronautical engineering at the U of Maryland, John Younger, estimated the relative weights of wings in terms of the buckling strength of a flat plate</li>
<li>according to his calculations, given a plywood wing weighing 100 pounds, an aluminium wing of equal buckling strength would weigh 255 pounds and a steel wing 500 pounds</li>
<li>explains why aluminium was preferred</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li>initial results of 1925 Army Air Corps bid for metal wing spars (30 different spars) showed that no metal spar performed as well as the best wood spars</li>
<li>primary failure mechanism was lateral buckling</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li>metal advocates believed metal was better suited to large airplanes, as buckling becomes less serious as airplanes increase in size: buckling strength increases with the cube of thickness</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
46
</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li>but no one in the 1920s could predict how big airplanes had to become before metal became preferable over wood</li>
<li>even in 1930, the largest American passenger airplanes revealed no clear advantage for metal in terms of weight efficiency</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li>stressed-skin design (skin as a load-bearing surface) made buckling failures even more likely</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
47
</p>

<p>
Advocates of metal had always assumed that ingenuity would solve the buckling problem, and by the late 1920s this assumption proved justified. By the end of the decade, several firms were building metal-winged airplanes with weight efficiencies comparable to wooden-winged airplanes. However, solving the buckling problem led to a new problem: metal structures were much more expensive to produce than equivalent wood structures.
</p>

<p>
48
</p>

<p>
The widespread faith that metal airplanes would ultimately prove cheaper to build than wood airplanes undoubtedly helped sustain support for metal construction during the 1920s. Yet subsequent experience proved this faith unfounded. Metal airplanes remained more costly than mixed wood-and-metal types throughout the 1930s, even though costs gradually decreased as airplane manufacturers gained experience with metal. 
</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li>in 1932 a plant manager at Boeing reported that all-metal fuselages cost Boeing twice as much as fabric-covered types when produced in same quantities</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
49
</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li>metal airplanes of 1930s required twice as many hours of labor per airframe pound as typical wood-and-fabric biplanes of 1922, despite the widespread application of machine tools during the 1930s</li>
</ul>
</p>

<br>

<p>
<ul>
<li>durability of duraluminium in question because of intercrystalline embrittlement</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
50
</p>

<p>
In 1930 Lieutenant Lloyd Harrison of the Navy Bureau of Aeronautics summarized his years of experience with metal airplanes: "We have found that wood ... was much more reliable than metal during the same period, with regard to the main structural elements." In another context, MIT professor Joseph Newell repeated with approval a comment made to him by the chief engineer of "one of our most progressive airplane companies. ..."For durability and dependability I'll have my all-metal airplanes made of wood.""
</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li>Alclad, an aluminium-clad duralumin alloy, solved corrosion problems, but no similar effort was made to solve the durability problems of wood aircraft</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
51
</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li>explaining success of metal cannot be done with deterministic explanations that rely solely on technical factors</li>
<li>systems, presumptive anomaly and entrepreneurial strategies approaches also fail to provide satisfactory accounts:</li>
<li>the problems with wood did not constitute a "reverse salient" preventing the continued expansion fo the civil aviation system</li>
<li>support for metal was not the result of farsighted engineers who recognized presumptive anomalies that demonstrated the inability of wood structures to meet future requirements
<ul>
<li>"There is no evidence that engineers based their support for metal on any clear conception of future requirements."</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
52
</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li>all the evidence suggests that metals firms were followers rather than leaders, so entrepreneurial approach doesn't work either</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li>but there is considerable evidence that ideology guided metal enthusiasts</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
53
</p>

<p>
My claim that ideology shapes technical choice conflicts with the dominant conception of technology as an archetype of rational discourse and action. For many people, ideology implies bias, irrationality, and dogmatism. This view centers on a definition of ideology as false belief. Ideology becomes a more useful concept if the historian begins with a nonevaluative definition, one that does not attribute truth or falsehood to the beliefs articulated in ideologies. In this definition, <b>ideology is an explicitly formulated system of beliefs that helps define a community and provide a common program of action.</b> Ideology guides action by allowing a community to make sense of a situation when myth and tradition prove inadequate, as they so often do with rapidly changing modern technologies.
</p>

<p>
54
</p>

<p>
Proponents supported this claim of inevitability by frequent analogies to past triumphs of metal. M. E. DeWoitine argued that the replacement of wood by metal was a repeating pattern in new technologies, which the airplane was destined to recapitulate. Wood dominated early airplanes because "wood is by nature essentially a material for new industries, ... ideal for the inventor, who ... obtained results with but little design and calculation." As the technology advanced, metal would become dominant, just as it had in other industries. 
</p>

<br>

<p>
<ul>
<li>but there was some reason for optimism, e.g. metal railway coaches had been initially heavier but they ultimately became lighter</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li>metal was also more "scientific" - although this argument was rarely fully articulated, it was often argued that metal permitted greater accuracy in stress calculations. </li>
<li>however, more refined calculations were of little use in design, because safety standards were based on ultimate (breaking) load, which occurred when stresses had passed far beyond the elastic limit</li>
<li>nevertheless, there was belief in that metal permits accurate predictions etc.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li>science had symbolic power even though most airplane engineers recognized its limits</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
56
</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li>there was a commitment to metal and a commitment to wood; very little arguments between what metal or what wood</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li>progress to metal seemed inevitable</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
58
</p>

<p>
The argument for metal was based not only on technical comparisons but also on historical analogies shaped by the progress ideology of metal. <br>
<ul>
<li>even defences of wood accepted the logic of this argument, which dictated the inevitable triumph of metal</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
60
</p>

<p>
The greatest problem with the durability of wooden airplanes lay not in the wood itself, but rather in the glued joints. 
</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li>enthusiasm for metal airplanes began to limit funding to wood research</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
62
</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li>eventually, one crash (so-called Rockne crash) was sufficient to erode public trust in wooden airplanes</li>
<li>little evidence that wooden construction had been the cause</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
63
</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li>synthetic resins were a neglected alternative</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
67
</p>

<p>
The deterministic rhetoric that linked metal with progress can only be understood as the articulation of this [progress] ideology [of metal].
</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li>the link between metal and progress was not forged by faith in technical progress alone; it was based on the widespread belief that modern industrial society was, in its essence, a shift from the organic to the inorganic. </li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
68
</p>

<p>
Both the general ideology of technical progress and the specific link between metal and progress proved attractive to engineers. As engineers professionalized, they seized on the idea of technical progress to legitimate their role in an industrial system dominated by large corporations. At the same time, engineers wrapped themselves in the mantle of "science" to distinguish their expertise from being traditional knowledge of craft workers.

Engineers proved particularly receptive to the rhetoric linking metal and progress. For mechanical engineers especially, "wood was anathema to the ideals of precision, power and production" that defined the profession and clearly distinguished engineers from millwrights and carpenters. Craft skills remained essential for working with metal as well as wood, but metal's uniformity made it attractive to engineers designing tasks for less skilled workers, especially in mass-production industries.
