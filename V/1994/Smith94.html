Introduction<br>
Leo Marx and Merritt Roe Smith<br>
(p. ix-xv)
</p>

<p>
- people may not know about technological determinism but the phenomenon it (ostensibly) represents is an omnipresent aspect of their awareness
</p>

<p>
x
</p>

<p>
- popular narratives of technology portray it as a driving force of history: <br>
a technical innovation suddenly appears and causes important things to happen. It is noteworthy that these mini-fables direct attention to the consequences rather than the genesis of inventions.<br>
- the usual emphasis is on the material artifact and the changes it presumably effects
</p>

<p>
xi
</p>

<p>
Unlike other, more abstract forces to which historians often assign determinative power (for example, socio-economic, political, cultural, and ideological formations), the thingness or tangibility of mechanical devices - their accessibility via sense perception - helps to create a sense of causal efficacy made visible. Taken together, these before-and-after narratives give credence to the idea of "technology" as an independent entity, a virtually autonomous agent of change.
</p>

<p>
Today a similar idea informs the popular discourse of technological determinism. It is typified by sentences in which "technology," or a surrogate like "the machine," is made the subject of an active predicate: "The automobile created suburbia." "The atomic bomb divested Congress of its power to declare war." "The mechanical cotton-picker set off the migration of southern black farm workers to northern cities." "The robots put the riveters out of work." "The Pill produced a sexual revolution." In each case, a complex event is made to seem the inescapable yet strikingly plausible result of a technological innovation. Many of these statements carry the further implication that the social consequences of our technical ingenuity are far-reaching, cumulative, mutually reinforcing, and irreversible. 
</p>

<p>
xii
</p>

<p>
- the essays in this volume suggest that the idea of technological determinism takes several forms along a spectrum between "hard" and "soft" extremes; <br>
- at the hard end, agency (the power to effect change) is imputed to technology itself, or to some of its intrinsic attributes; thus the advance of technology leads to a situation of inescapable necessity.<br>
- we have technologized ourselves to a point where our technologies permit few alternatives to their inherent dictates<br>
- but can agency be imputed to technology?
</p>

<p>
xiii
</p>

<p>
- soft determinists begin by reminding us that the history of technology is a history of human actions; to understand the origin of a particular kind of technological power, we must first learn about the actors. Who were they? What were their circumstances? Why was the innovation made by these people and not others? Why was it possible at this time and this place rather than another time or place?<br>
- instead of treating "technology" per se as the locus of historical agency, the soft determinists locate it in a far more various and complex social, economic, political, and cultural matrix.

Technological Determinism in American Culture<br>
Smith, Merritt Roe<br>
1-35
</p>

<p>
- brief history of technological determinism and how deeply it is embedded in American culture<br>
- as early as the 1780s public servants began to attribute agency to the new mechanical technologies associated with the rise of the factory system<br>
- grew during 19th century
</p>

<p>
2
</p>

<p>
The belief in technology as a key governing force in society dates back at least to the early stages of the Industrial Revolution. 
</p>

<p>
- two versions can be distinguished: <br>
- "soft" which holds that technological change drives social change but at the same time responds discriminatingly to social pressures, and <br>
- "hard" which perceives technological development as an autonomous force, completely independent of social constraints
</p>

<p>
34
</p>

<p>
- notes that many critics who deplore the pervasive power of technology are in fact close to technological determinism: of Mumford, Ellul and Winner, Ellul in particular endows technology with a degree of agency that goes even beyond the most enthusiastic technocratic determinists<br>
- however, Mumford and Winner are more nuanced, underscoring issues of technological choice and depicting technologies as social products as well as social forces<br>
- "technocratic" determinism often uncritically equates technological change with progress

Recourse of Empire: Landscapes of Progress in Technological America<br>
Smith, Michael L.<br>
37-52
</p>

<p>
- the essay asks how Americans came to attach so much of their national and personal identity to technology<br>
- sees this as a product of "curious cultural and political fetishism," but also sees that the idea of technology as progress gained widespread currency "precisely because it could be depicted as carving an uncontested, inevitable path." <br>
- argues that media representations of technology are crucial to understanding both how public opinion about technology forms and how opinions change<br>
- illustrates this process by comparing two "landscapes of progress" from 1868 and 1952
</p>

<p>
38
</p>

<p>
One of the social effects of technological change is that it prompts cultures to wonder where they are heading.
</p>

<p>
- technological determinism: <br>
The gist of it is heartbreaking in its simplicity: the belief that social progress is driven by technological innovation, which in turn follows an "inevitable" course. 
</p>

<p>
- this is a view that is in conflict with Second Law of Thermodynamics, conjuring up a non-entropic universe in which dust never settles, things cohere and grow supple with time, and everything is always new and improved<br>
- is faith in technology-as-progress substitute for a more genuine participatory democracy?
</p>

<p>
39
</p>

<p>
- suggests that adherents of creationism and technological determinism share a social terrain and a and a vocabulary of representation;

Do Machines Make History?<br>
Heilbroner, Robert L.<br>
53-65<br>
(first appeared in Technology and Culture (8) (July 1967), 335-345
</p>

<p>
- of the scholars represented in this anthology, economic historian Robert Heilbroner comes closest to embracing technological determinism; but does so with carefully stated qualifications<br>
- this now-classic 1967 essay seeks to specify the extent to which technology determines "the nature of the socioeconomic order"<br>
- shows that technological change follows a roughly ordered sequence of development and that it "imposes certain social and political characteristics upon the society in which it is found." <br>
- opts for "soft" determinism, because he sees a complex historical scenario in which technology, while acting on society, also reflects the influence of socioeconomic forces on its development<br>
- ultimately he views technology as a strong "mediating factor" rather than as _the_ determining influence on history
</p>

<p>
54
</p>

<p>
"The hand-mill gives you society with the feudal lord; the steam-mill, society with the industrial capitalist." Marx, The Poverty of Philosophy
</p>

<p>
That machines make history in some sense - that the level of technology has a direct bearing on the human drama - is of course obvious. That they do not make all of history, however that word be defined, is equally clear. 
</p>

<p>
- the question Heilbroner is interested in this essay concerns the effect of technology in determining the nature of the socioeconomic order<br>
- in simplest terms: did medieval technology bring about feudalism? Is industrial technology the necessary and sufficient condition for capitalism? Will the technology of the computer and the atom constitute the ineluctable cause of a new social order?
</p>

<p>
55
</p>

<p>
- no research (in 1967 at least) about whether there is a fixed sequence to technological development and therefore a necessitous path over which technologically developing societies must travel<br>
- believes that there is; impossible to proceed to the age of the steam-mill until one has passed through the age of the hand-mill
</p>

<p>
56
</p>

<p>
- argues that there exists "a determinate sequence of productive technology for those societies that are interested in originating and applying such a technology"<br>
- evidence: <br>
1) simultaneity of invention: well known from e.g. Merton, Singletons and Multiples in Scientific Discovery; this argues that the process of discovery takes place along a well-defined frontier of knowledge rather than in grab-bag fashion. Related phenomenon of technological "clustering" again suggests that technical evolution follows a sequential and determinate rather than random course.
</p>

<p>
2) The absence of technological leaps: all inventions and innovations, by definition, represent an advance of the art beyond existing base lines. Yet, most advances, particularly in retrospect, appear essentially incremental, evolutionary. If nature <br>
57<br>
makes no sudden leaps, neither, it would appear, does technology. <br>
- no experiments in electricity in 1500, no attempts to extract energy from the atom in 1700. <br>
On the whole, the development of the technology of production presents a fairly smooth and continuous profile rather than one of jagged peaks and discontinuities.
</p>

<p>
3) The predictability of technology: although there are all kinds of predictions, the interesting thing is that the development of technical progress has always seemed _intrinsically_ predictable. <br>
- although we cannot lay down timetables of technical discovery or rule out surprises, many scientists would likely be willing to make general predictions s to the nature of technological capability 25 or even 50 years ahead. This, too, suggests that technology follows a developmental sequence rather than arriving in a more chancy fashion
</p>

<p>
- these are not _proof_ of the claim that technology follows a determined sequence, but make it plausible<br>
- two deeper-seated reasons why technology _should_ display a "structured" history:
</p>

<p>
1) a major constraint always operates on the technological capacity of an age: the constraint of its accumulated stock of available knowledge. <br>
58<br>
- gradual expansion of knowledge frontier
</p>

<p>
2) material competence of the age, its level of technical expertise: to make a steam engine for example requires not only knowledge about steam but the ability to cast iron cylinders of considerable dimensions with tolerable accuracy.<br>
- the difficulties experienced by Watt and Boulton in achieving a fit of piston to cylinder illustrate the problems of creating a technology, in contrast with a single, expensive "toy" machine
</p>

<br>

<p>
- also required: not just knowledge or sheer skill but also sufficient division of labor and the specialization of industry; this in turn hinges to a considerable degree on the sheer size of the stock of capital itself
</p>

<p>
Thus the slow and painful accumulation of capital,<br>
59<br>
from which springs the gradual diversification of industrial function, becomes an independent regulator of the reach of technical capability.
</p>

<p>
- this reasoning about technical sequences is easily faulted as post hoc ergo proper hoc; 
</p>

<p>
but:  it's probably not ...just by happenstance that the steam-mill follows, and does not precede, the hand-mill, nor is it mere fantasy in our own day when we speak of the coming of the automatic factory. In the future as in the past, the development of the technology of production seems bounded by the constraints of knowledge and capability and thus, in principle at least, open to prediction as a determinable force of the historical process. 
</p>

<p>
- the second proposition to be investigated: is it true that a certain mode of production or industrial stage is always combined with a  certain mode of cooperation, or social stage?
</p>

<p>
- thinks that we can indeed state that the technology of a society imposes a determinate pattern of social relations on that society
</p>

<p>
60
</p>

<p>
- at least two such modes of influence:
</p>

<p>
1) The composition of the labor force; e.g. hand mills required skilled or semiskilled individuals working freely on their own; steam-mill required semiskilled or unskilled operatives who could work only at the factory and only at the strict time schedule
</p>

<p>
2) the hierarchical organization of work: man-master relationship is different from men-manager relationship
</p>

<p>
61
</p>

<p>
- note of caution: there is a danger in discussing the structure of the labor force or the nature of intrafirm organization of assigning the sole causal efficacy to the visible presence of machinery and of overlooking the invisible influences of other factors at work<br>
- e.g. it has been claimed that typewriters brought women to work in offices and typesetting machines made possible the great modern newspaper, but in Japan there are (were) woman office workers and great modern newspapers getting practically no help from typewriters and typesetting machines (see Gilfillan 1952)
</p>

<p>
In addition, even where technology seems unquestionably to play the critical role, an independent "social" element unavoidably enters the scene in the _design_ of technology, which must take into account such facts as the level of education of the work force or its relative price. In this way the machine will reflect, as much as mold, the social relationships of work. 
</p>

<p>
...
</p>

<p>
A foreknowledge of the shape of the technical core of society 50 years hence may not allow us to describe the political attributes of that society, and may perhaps only hint at its sociological character, but assuredly it presents us with a profile of requirements, both in labor skills an din supervisory needs, that differ considerably from those of today. We cannot say whether the society<br>
62<br>
of the computer will give us the latter-day capitalist or the commissar, but it seems beyond question tat it will give us the technician and the bureaucrat.
</p>

<p>
- the qualifications and objections to the Marxian paradigm:
</p>

<p>
<ol type="1" start="1">
<li>Technological progress is itself a social activity: innovation is an attribute of some societies and not of others</li>
<li>The course of technological advance is responsive to social direction: the general _level_ of technology may follow an independently determined sequential path, but its areas of application certainly reflect social influences.</li>
</ol>
63<br>
<ol type="1" start="3">
<li>Technological change must be compatible with existing social conditions; labor-saving machinery will not find ready acceptance in a society where labor is abundant and cheap as a factor of production. </li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
- technology plays a _mediating role_ instead of being primum mobile
</p>

<p>
64
</p>

<p>
- what is the mediating role played by technology within modern Western society?
</p>

<p>
<ol type="1" start="1">
<li>The rise of capitalism provided a major stimulus for the development of a technology of production: when market system organized around the principle of private property emerged, there also emerged an institution capable of systematically guiding the inventive and innovative abilities of society to the problem of facilitating production. </li>
</ol>
- 18th and 19th centuries provided novel and extremely effective encouragement for the development of an _industrial_ technology, and the slowly opening political and social framework of late mercantilist society gave rise to social aspirations for which the new technology offered the best chance of realization. 
</p>

<p>
<ol type="1" start="2">
<li>The expansion of technology within the market system took on a new "automatic" aspect: under the burgeoning market system not alone the initiation of technical improvement but its subsequent adoption and repercussions through the economy was largely governed by market considerations. As a result, both the rise and the proliferation of technology assumed the attributes of an impersonal diffuse "force" bearing on social and economic life. This was all the more pronounced because the political control needed to buffer its disruptive consequences was seriously inhibited by the prevailing laissez-faire ideology.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
<ol type="1" start="3">
<li>The rise of science gave a new impetus to technology: the period of early capitalism roughly coincided with and provided a congenial setting for the development of an independent source of technological encouragement - the rise of the self-conscious activity of science. </li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
...
</p>

<p>
It is for these reasons that technology take on a special significance in the context of capitalism - or, for that matter, of a socialism based on maximizing production or minimizing costs. For in these societies,<br>
65<br>
both the continuous appearance of technical advance and its diffusion throughout the society assume the attributes of autonomous process, "mysteriously" generated by society and thrust upon its members in a manner as indifferent as it is imperious. This is why, I think, the problem of technological determinism - of how machines make history - comes to us with such insistence despite the ease with which we can disprove its more extreme contentions. 
</p>

<p>
Technological determinism is thus peculiarity a problem of a certain historical epoch - specifically that of high capitalism and low socialism - in which the forces of technical change have been unleashed, but when the agencies for the control or guidance of technology are still rudimentary.

<p>
Technological Determinism Revisited<br>
Heilbroner, Robert<br>
67-78
</p>

<p>
68<br>
- the basic premise of "modern" historiography is that instead of historical processes being dominated by inscrutable forces, this background arises from the same kinds of processes and can be approached and apprehended at the same levels of understanding and explanation as the objects of immediate scrutiny.
</p>

<p>
69
</p>

<p>
- the question is not "do machines make history" but "how machines make history"
</p>

<p>
- machines (denoting both individual mechanisms and a general level of technological development) largely define what it means to live in a certain epoch - at least, as an economic historian might define life<br>
- Rosalind Williams points out in this volume that such an economics-oriented viewpoint not only begs serious questions but also establishes powerful agendas
</p>

<p>
70
</p>

<p>
- technological determinism requires a connection between "machinery" and "history" that displays law like properties: a force field of sorts
</p>

<p>
71<br>
- this force field has to be able "to translate the stimuli emitted by a changing technology into behavioral responses of a predictable kind with regard to transformations of a socioeconomic order."
</p>

<p>
A huge variety of stimuli, arising from alterations in the material background, must be translated into a few well-defined behavioral vectors. There must be a systematic reduction of complexity of cause into simplicity of effect, enabling us to explain how the development of new machineries of production can alter the social relationships constitutive of feudalism into those of capitalism...
</p>

<p>
- argues that _economics_  provides the mechanism<br>
...in the sense of a force field in which a principle of "maximizing" imposes order on behavior in a fashion comparable to the magnet and the gravitational pull of the sun. 
</p>

<p>
72
</p>

<p>
- this can of course work only in a capitalist social order where, as Marx emphasized, "the multifarious world of use values is transmuted into a one-dimensional world of exchange values"
</p>

<p>
In this social order, changes in the technological background are registered in changes in the price stem, indicating the directions in which economic activity can most advantageously move and the forms it can most profitably assume. Thus the force field of maximizing allows us to elucidate how machines make history by showing the<br>
73<br>
mediating mechanism by which changes in technology are brought to bear on the organization of the social order. This leads in turn to the possibility of applying an analytic understanding to such large-scale social changes as the composition of the labor force and the hierarchical organization of work, not to mention the dynamics characteristic of economic activity as a whole.
</p>

<p>
74
</p>

<p>
- one reason why economic behavior has such prominence in analysis is because it manifests a degree of orderliness absent from "political" and "sociological" activities - it is easier to analyze in other words!
</p>

<p>
- but technological determinism does not imply that human behavior must be deprived of its core of consciousness and responsibility: it offers a _heuristic of investigation_, not a logic of decision-making
</p>

<p>
The premise is that living behavior is not random or chaotic, but marked by undeniable, although imprecise regularities: "undeniable" because predictable behavior is the basis on which all social life is raised; "imprecise" not only because there are obvious variants in behavior from one social entity to the next, but also because there exists a margin of behavioral indeterminacy within any given individual. Technological determinism then goes on to posit that the acquisitive mindset is a regular and dependable motive for behavior, at least in market-coordinated societies. 
</p>

<p>
78
</p>

<p>
- Rosalind Williams (this volume) protests that a deterministic heuristic, however soft, involves us in a cramping view of history's palimpsest, throwing aside much of its endlessly rich interpretational receptivity in favor of the thin stuff of behavioral "laws" and socioeconomic "formations." <br>
- but disapproval of economics as "universal science" is one thing, and disavowal another: we live in a  world where an economic calculus takes precedence over, and enters into the definitions of, many aspects of life. 
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
Three Faces of Technological Determinism<br>
Bimber, Bruce<br>
79-100
</p>

<p>
- takes a different tack to Heilbroner: specifically, distinguishes three interpretations of technological determinism<br>
1) normative<br>
2) nomological<br>
3) unintended consequences<br>
- develops a set of criteria with which to test the rigor and the legitimacy of these interpretations<br>
- this strict approach does not admit such distinctions as "hard" and "soft" determinism<br>
- argues that only nomological accounts are "truly technologically deterministic"<br>
- tests the model by applying it to the work of Karl Marx and shows that Marx was not a technological determinist.
</p>

<p>
80
</p>

<p>
- even a cursory examination of the literature on technology and social change reveals that "technological determinism" is used to describe more than one phenomenon
</p>

<p>
82
</p>

<p>
- normative approach: technology is considered autonomous and deterministic when the norms by which it is advanced are removed from political and ethical discourse and when goals of efficiency or productivity become surrogates for value-based debate over methods, alternatives, means, and ends (Habernas's critique)<br>
- this informs many incarnations of technological determinism, such as Ellul's, for whom technique is not merely technology but the domination of social, political, and economic life by the adopted goals of logic and efficiency<br>
83<br>
- warnings of dangers of "megatechnics" or "technology-out-of-control" belong to same category
</p>

<p>
- Nomological approach: true determinism - "given the past, and the laws of nature, there is only one possible future." (Peter Van Inwagen)<br>
- Cohen takes technological determinism to mean that "machinery and allied subhuman powers somehow function as the independent agencies of history"<br>
- claims that technology itself exercises causal influence on social practice<br>
84<br>
Implicit in this account are two claims: that technological developments occur according to some naturally given logic, which is not culturally or socially determined, and that these developments force social adaptation and changes. <br>
- this differs sharply from Ellul's and Habernas's views!<br>
- in Normative accounts, it is precisely that which people have come to think and desire that produces the technological society. In Nomological accounts, the technology-driven society emerges regardless of human desires and values.<br>
- argues that Heilbroner's Do Machines Make History? is nomological interpretation
</p>

<p>
85
</p>

<p>
- Unintended Consequences account: e.g. early proponents of automobile argued it would lessen horse manure problems, but didn't see smog or other problems the car would bring<br>
- since even willful, ethical social actors are unable to anticipate the effects of technological development, technology can be thought of as at least partially autonomous. 
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
Technological Momentum<br>
Hughes, Thomas P.<br>
101-113
</p>

<p>
- "technological momentum" originates from Hughes's 1969 article on hydrogenation in post-WW1 Germany<br>
- ever since, scholars have debated whether it is synonymous with technological determinism, and if not, how they differ<br>
- in this essay, Hughes locates technological momentum somewhere between the poles of technological determinism and social constructivism<br>
- shows that younger developing systems tend to be more open to sociocultural influences while older, more mature systems prove to be more independent of outside influences and therefore more deterministic in nature<br>
- Hughes sees technological momentum as an alternative to technological determinism and contends that it is a more valuable interpretative connect than either technological determinism or social constructivism because it is time dependent yet sensitive to the messy complexities of society and culture<br>
- sees technological momentum as integrative concept that gives equal weight to social and technical forces
</p>

<p>
102
</p>

<p>
- defines technological determinism simply as the belief that technical forces determine social and cultural changes<br>
- defines social construction presuming that social and cultural forces determine technical change<br>
- defines technological momentum inferring that social development shapes and is shaped by technology; momentum is also time dependent
</p>

<p>
- uses "technical" to refer both to artifacts and software; by "technology" usually means technological or sociotechnical systems
</p>

<p>
- defines "social" as the world that is not technical, or that is not hardware or technical software. <br>
This world is made up of institutions, values, interest groups, social classes, and political and economic forces. <br>
103<br>
- sees the social and the technical as interacting within technological systems
</p>

<p>
- critique of social constructivism: sees that Bijker and Pinch (1987) argument about interpretative flexibility - that various meanings given by social groups to, say, the bicycle, result in a number of alternative designs of that machine, <br>
104<br>
as tending towards social determinism<br>
- rejects based on that ground
</p>

- loosely/tightly coupled components in a technological system, see Perrow 1984 (Normal Accidents); often loosely coupled institutions (e.g. relevant departments in universities) are not recognized to be part of the technological or socio-technical system<br>
- but is something part of the environment or part of the system? Hughes suggests that if a component (e.g. regulatory authority) is free of control and influence from the focal component of the system, it should be considered as being part of the environment
</p>

<p>
106
</p>

<p>
As a system matures, a bureaucracy of managers and white-collar employees usually plus an increasingly prominent role in maintaining and expanding the system, so that it then becomes more social and less technical.
</p>

<p>
110
</p>

<p>
- oftentimes, when the environment changes, a technological system becomes a solution looking for a problem; e.g. railway builders turned to subway construction after they were not needed, Haber-Bosch process engineers turned to synthetic fuels, Wilson Dam was turned from nitrogen fixation power source to basis of TVA, one of the highlights of the New Deal
</p>

<p>
111
</p>

<p>
This durable artifact [Wilson Dam] acted over time like a magnetic field, attracting plans and projects suited to its characteristics. Systems of artifacts are not neutral forces, they tend to shape the environment in particular ways.
</p>

<p>
- system builders know that technological momentum provides the durability and the propensity for growth for a system
</p>

<p>
112
</p>

<p>
- in conclusion, a technological system can be both a cause and an effect, it can shape or be shaped by society<br>
- as technological systems grow larger and more complex, they tend to be more shaping of society and less shaped by it<br>
- suggests that shaping is easiest before the system has acquired political, economic, and value components<br>
- a system with great technological momentum can be made to change direction if a variety of its components are subjected to the forces of change<br>
113<br>
Because social and technical components interact so thoroughly in technological systems and because the inertia of these systems is so large, they bring to mind the iron-cage metaphor that Max Weber used in describing the organizational bureaucracies that proliferated at the beginning of the twentieth century. Technological systems, however, are bureaucracies reinforced by technical, or physical, infrastructures which give them even greater rigidity and mass than the social bureaucracies that were the subject of Weber's attention. Nevertheless, we must remind ourselves that technological momentum, like physical momentum, is not irresistible.

Retrieving Sociotechnical Change from Technological Determinism<br>
Misa, Thomas J.<br>
115-141<br>
- maintains that the level at which scholars conduct their research directly influences the degree of emphasis they place on technological change in their historical interpretations<br>
- those who conduct "macro-level" studies are prone to technological determinism, while those who conduct "micro-level" studies are apt to find more contingent and multiple societal forces at work in the historical process<br>
- Misa suggests a "middle-level" methodology that directs attention to the actors, institutions, and processes intermediate between the macro and the micro<br>
- uses as example the origins of vertical integration at the Carnegie Steel company in the 19th century<br>
- shows that neither the "demands" of technology nor high-level strategy had much to do with the advent of vertical integration; Andrew Carnegie and his senior partners seemed almost oblivious to its advantages<br>
- only after middle-level official repeatedly pleaded with Carnegie to take action did he move toward the acquisition of invaluable iron ore properties in the upper midwest, and then almost as an afterthought<br>
- the advantage of middle-level analysis is that it allows historians to combine the contingent, social construction of the micro approach with the "big picture" impact of the macro approach<br>
- specifically it means focusing on institutions "intermediate" between the firm and the market and between the individual and the state
</p>

<p>
116
</p>

<p>
- there has been little research on how technology shapes society, although there has been a lot of research into how society shapes technology
</p>

<p>
117
</p>

<p>
I will argue that machines make history when historians and other analysts adopt a "macro" perspective, whereas a causal role for the machine is not present and is not possible for analysts who adopt a "micro" perspective
</p>

<p>
118
</p>

<p>
- it is the perspective choice which is enough to cause an author to adopt a technological deterministic view (or deny it), not his political failings
</p>

<p>
119
</p>

<p>
Besides taking a larger unit of analysis, macro studies tend to abstract from individual cases, to impute rationality on actors' behalf's or posit functionality for their actions, and to be order-driven. Accounts focusing on these "order-bestowing principles" lead toward technological, economic, or ecological determinism. 
</p>

<p>
- converse for micro level studies
</p>

<p>
Generally, macro studies make it easy for historical actors to appear rational, purposeful, and as key agents of change, whereas micro studies make it difficult or impossible for historical actors to have these same attributes. 
</p>

<p>
125
</p>

<p>
- uses two interpretations! Micro and macro
</p>

<p>
137
</p>

<p>
The challenge for a micro interpretation is to explain the paradoxical result by which a non rational process (acquisitions made for motives unrelated to the process of vertical integration) eventually yielded a rational result. The response is a methodological observation: The emergence of any particular pattern, especially across a significant duration of time, does not imply that any single individual's motive must have been to seek that pattern. Technological-determinist accounts often conflate outcomes (long-term patterns that can be entirely independent of actors' conscious agendas) with motivations (short-term conscious agendas of actors). To assert that the emergence of a particular pattern was _caused_ by someone's consciously planning the emergence of that pattern can be, in the absence of evidence, to commit the logical error of post hoc ergo proper hoc.
</p>

<p>
138
</p>

<p>
- major problem with macro studies is that they level historical processes that are full of conflicting values and actors, and that they hamper the integration of macro and micro levels by invoking deterministic forces that micro studies literally cannot locate
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, micro studies, in the attempt to demonstrate the socially constructed nature of technology, often omit comment on the intriguing question of whether technology has any influence on anything. 
</p>

<p>
139
</p>

<p>
- suitable <b>meso level for for historians of technology</b> and business might be e.g. manufacturers organizations, including cartels and inter firm networks; standard-setting bodies, including the engineering profession and public agencies; export-import firms specializing in technology transfer; consulting engineering firms; investment banking houses

Determinism and Indeterminacy in the History of Technology<br>
Scranton, Philip<br>
143-168
</p>

<p>
- makes a strong case against deterministic master narratives and in favor of more variegated contextual accounts<br>
- contrasts strongly with determinists such as Heilbroner<br>
- argues for "local determinism"
</p>

<p>
146
</p>

<p>
- conjectures that technological determinism came closer to being an article of faith in the US between 1940 and 1960 than ever before or since
</p>

<p>
154
</p>

<p>
- argues for "local" determinism:
</p>

<p>
The evolving tapestry of context-framing actions and action-inducing contexts generated a technological momentum different from that to which Hughes (this volume) refers, for it was open, non-systemic, locally determined, and as much dependent on social relations as on engineering refinements.
