Issues addressed in this book include the following:
</p>

<p>
- the role of innovation in industrial competition<br>
- the sources of industry-shattering innovations<br>
- the relationship between product and process innovation in the cycle of industry development and competition, with special attention to the differences between assembled products (such as automobiles and typewriters) and nonassembled or homogenous products (such as rayon and glass)<br>
- the behavior of established firms when a radical innovation invades a stable industry<br>
- the habits of mind and strategy that so often prevent today’s dominant firms from bridging from the product technologies of the present to those of the future<br>
- how firms can successfully renew their competitiveness as one generation of technology succeeds another
</p>

<p>
xviii
</p>

<p>
- the rate of product innovation in an industry or product class is highest dyring its formative years. This is a period called the “fluid phase,” during which a great deal of experimentation with product design and operational characteristics takes place among competitors<br>
- rate of process innovation is less rapid<br>
- fluiditity period gives way to “transitional phase,” in which the rate of major product innovation slows down and the rate of major process innovations speeds up <br>
- at this point, product variety begins to give way to standard designs that have either proven themselves in the marketplace as the best form for satisfying user needs, or designs that have been dictated by accepted standards, by legal or regulatory constraints<br>
- some industries enter a “specific phase” in which the rate of major innovation dwindles for both product and process - these industries become extremely focused on cost, volume, and capacity; product and process innovation appears in small, incremental steps
</p>

<p>
xx
</p>

<p>
- dominant designs:<br>
A dominant design usually takes the form of a new product synthesized from individual technological innovations introduced independently in prior product variants. A dominant design has the effect of enforcing or encouraging standardization so that production or other complementary economies can be sought. Then effective competition begins to take place on the basis of cost and scale as well as of product performance. 
</p>

<p>
18
</p>

<p>
- a number of distinct developments can be seen:<br>
- New innovations from old capabilities: typewriters were a synthesis of a number of existing mechanical technologies, that, joined together, created something new.<br>
- dominant design: doinant design emerged, and after that, experimentation with the fundamental systems tapered off<br>
- a shifting ecology of firms<br>
- waves of technological change<br>
- changing leadership at breakpoints in technology<br>
- the invasion of alien technology
</p>

<p>
48
</p>

<p>
The idea of dominant design does not seem to hold in indstries producing nonassembled products such as rayon, glass, pulp and paper, metals, or industrial gases. Also, product categories such as integrated circuits and photographic film may be difficult to classify, as they share some characteristics of both assembled and nonassembled products.
</p>

<p>
Because nonassembled products contain fewer materals than assembled products do, there is more concentrated focus of technlogical effort and experimentation in the production process; periods of variation and experimentation result in what might be called an enabling technology. This enabling technology incorporates many of the elements needed in a continuous production process and allows the focus of technological effort to shift to process improvement rather than process innovation and design.

- the caseof electric lighting points up a number of importantl lessons about the development and diffusin of technological innovations:
</p>

<p>
- Outsiders as innovators<br>
- social as well as technical factors need to be considered<br>
- defensive innovation by established technology

<p>
The essential difference in the productivity gains from process innovations may, in the final analysis, come down to the fact that complex assembled products have many more process steps than do nonassembled products. … The combination of two or three of theses steps into one has only a limited effect; the engine maker still faces 128 or 129 steps. …
</p>

<p>
The most archaic plate glassmaking process, by contrast, had only basic five production steps. And combining these steps has resulted in order-of-magnitude innovations.
</p>

<p>
The high cost of introducing process innovations
</p>

<p>
… Technological discontinuities produce abrupt improvements but often involve tremendous investments in research and new plant and equipment. Sir Alastair Pilkington once remarked that had he and his directors known the full extent of the cost of developing float glass technology, they might never have tried it. 
</p>

<p>
- it would’nt break even on cash flows for 12 years
</p>

<p>
119
</p>

<p>
… It was a private firm at the time, with wealthy owners who did not need to concern themselves with annual cash dividends or the ups and downs of their stock price. Today it is a public firm, and during a speech to an audience at MIT, former chief scientist Dennis Oliver remarked thatn under the constraints of public ownership, no such gamble would have been taken.

<p>
- In Stobaught (1988:27) is a curve showing the probability of next new process representing a major innovation. It follows an inverse power law.
</p>

<p>
128
</p>

<p>
- in nonassembled products, outsiders play a role, but insiders play a bigger role, as knowledge of the subtleties of manufacturing practices provides a fertile environment for innovation
</p>

<p>
129
</p>

<p>
The patterns of innovation for assembled and nonassembled products are thus different in the sense that the rate of process innovation quickly outstrips the rate of product innovation among nonassembled goods, and process innovation dominates the industry as it passes through the transitional and into the specific phases of its evolution.

Study about productivity gains in petroleum cracking: 
</p>

<p>
131
</p>

<p>
In his study of the petroleum refining industry, John Enos found that since the first commercially successful method of “cracking” heavy hydrocarbons into gasoline components was introduced in 1913, there have been three waves of process innovation: one in the early 1920s, another in 1936, and the final one in the 1940s. Each successive wave yielded improved processes, displacing those of earlier waves. Enos attributes each of these waves of innovation to a different motive cause: to extract more gasoline out of increasingly scarce crude oil; to reduce refining cost; and to improve quality. As he remarked:
</p>

<p>
“These inventions and innovations … permitted the manufacture of products of higher qualities and greater yields at successively lower costs. The processes … were initially noncontinuous and subsequently continuous in operation. In almost all cases the inventions were made by men close to the oil industry but not attached to the major firms.” (9)
</p>

<p>
As in the plate glassmaking industry, where each major process innovation led to very large productivity gains, Enos showed the astonishing productivity gains from three waves of innovation. These innovations resulted in the sizable gains in raw material, capital, labor, and energy productivity seen in the first two columns of numbers in the table. Incremental improvements to the last innovation - the fluid process - between its original installation and what Enos describes as its “present installation (about 1961) accounts for still more productivity gains.

These are the “process discontinuities that researchers Anderson and Tushman describe as<br>
132<br>
“…fundamentally different ways of making a product that are reflected in order-of-magnitude improvements in the cost or quality of the product. They include the Bessemer furnace in steel production, catalytic cracking of petroleum, electronic imaging (vs. light-lens copying), genetic engineering using restriction enzymes, and dry gelatin photographic processes.” (10)
</p>

<p>
While a good portion of the great increases in refining capabilities were won through small, incremental process improvements, others came in large chunks (with introductions of the Burton process in 1914, and the fluid process in 1955).
</p>

<p>
Johan Gullichsen’s study of chemical wood-pulping operations reveals a similar pattern. Gullichsen explains that wood pulping was once a batch process of cooking, bleaching, washing, and pulping wood chis, but is now a continuous operation. The first major process improvement was the elimination of multistage washers and their appetites for abundant water and process time in favor of a single step. Further technological advance in 1964 by
</p>

<p>
133
</p>

<p>
Howard Rapson and Bertil Andersson led to a process in which all the many bleaching stages were carried out in one reactor. The reactor itself was smaller than any of the many pieces of equipment it displaced and further reduced water requirements. … This technology reduced the number of process steps and water requirements each by a factor of seven times. Gullichsen, one of the signal contributors to the continuous pulp process, anticipated similar step reductions in the years ahead (11)

Like the emergence of a dominant design, the emergence of a major change in process architecture - a discontinuous change - is not always apparent. Recognition of an emerging dominant design is difficult except in retrospect, but with a new process architecture, several obvious signs can alert us. First, as Anderson and Tushman have stated, there are order-of-magnitude cost and quality improvements. It might be fair to restate this asa great increase in output relative to the same level of input. But even here, greater output or greater quality from a new architecture may not be so obvious; major new processes are usually riddled with technical problems that are worked out only over time. The Pilkington float glass process is a perfect example. The second sign is the number of process steps. As discussed in Chapter 5, the combination or elimination of steps, or success in making batch processes continuous, is usually a clear indicator of a change in process architecture.
