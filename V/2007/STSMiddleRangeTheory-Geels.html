</p>

<p>
The article discusses the state of STS, expressing feelings of discontent regarding four aspects: policy relevance, conceptual language, too much focus on complexity, theoretical styles. Proposes middle range theory as an alternative, promising avenue. Middle range theories focus on delimited topics, make explicit efforts to combine concepts, and search for abstracted patterns and explanatory mechanisms. Presents achievements in that direction for technology dynamics, particularly with regard to the role of expectations, niche theory and radical innovation, and the multi-level perspective on sociotechnical transitions.
</p>

<p>
- talk of middle range theory (MRT) is often indication of discontent in a discipline, suggesting a middle way between undesirable extremes
</p>

<p>
628
</p>

<p>
- MRT notion introduced my Merton in sociology in three editions of Social Theory and Social Structure (1949, 1957, 1968). <br>
- The core of his concern was that the development of an all-encompassing system of concepts would prove both futile and sterile<br>
- Merton not only attacked grand theoretical systems but also criticized the opposite strategy of constructing inventories of low-level empirical propositions<br>
- Merton defined MRT as a middle way, as "theories that lie between the minor but necessary working hypotheses that evolve in abundance during day-to-day research and the all-inclusive systematic efforts to develop a unified theory that will explain all the observed uniformities of social behavior, social organization and social change (Merton 1968:39)<br>
- i.e. MRT relates to theoretical scope<br>
- examples of MRTs: self-fulfilling prophecies, reference group theory, role-sets, dissonance theory and the two-step flow model<br>
- MRT consists of a limited set of interrelated propositions, aimed at understanding limited topics<br>
- MRT is not about broad, abstract entities such as "society" or "social system"<br>
- MRT addresses only delimited aspects of social phenomena<br>
- another characteristic is that concepts and propositions should be CLEAR, SPECIFIC and EMPIRICALLY RESEARCHABLE<br>
- MRT differs from grand theory because it emphasizes interaction between theory and empirical research<br>
- third characteristic is that MRTs specify relationships between concepts into analytical models
</p>

<p>
"An array of concepts does not constitute theory. ... It is only when such concepts are interrelated in the form of a scheme that a theory begins to emerge. Concepts then constitute the definitions or prescriptions of what is to be observed.<br>
629<br>
They are the variables between which empirical relationships are to be sought." (Merton 1968:143)
</p>

<p>
- analytica models and mechanisms are not deterministic, but indicate how one concept influences another<br>
- In organization theory, Pinder and Moore (1980) proposed MRT in an edited volume containing 35 chapters from different contributors<br>
- grand theory had dominated between 1920 and 1950<br>
- these were stated at a level of abstraction such that it was impossible to deduce hypotheses amenable to disproof<br>
- a general problem is that because MRT is usually an expression of discontent, it is clearer what it should not be, rather than what it is. <br>
630<br>
- Boudon (1991:520) discusses MRT, gives the following general delineation: "a set of statements that organize a set of hypotheses and relate them to segregated observations. If a 'theory' is valid, it 'explains' and in other words 'consolidates' and federates empirical regularities which on their side would otherwise appear segregated. This amounts also to saying that mere empiricism is of little worth."
</p>

<p>
- the feelings of unease that underlie MRT in STS:
</p>

<p>
##Limited impact on policy and other disciplines
</p>

<p>
- for the 25 years of STS, see Edge (2003)<br>
- he expressed concerns about its limited impact on policy and other disciplines<br>
- Geels shares his diagnosis, sees three explanations:
</p>

<p>
<ol type="1" start="1">
<li>The proliferation of concepts and jargon that are hard to understand for outsiders</li>
<li>Emphasis on complexity, local situatedness and contingency, which makes it difficult to communicate general lessons</li>
<li>Normative aversion against instrumental contributions, for fear of technocracy</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
Hence, most policy contributions are critical or reflexive, criticizing policy discourses for their "wrong" assumptions about technology and society. 
</p>

<p>
- Collins and Evans (2002) feel "a little uncomfortable when every treatment has the same political recipe, because it makes it all too easy to imagine that the prime motivation is political rather than analytical" (p. 263)
</p>

<h2>Concepts are not (yet) theory</h2>

<br>

<p>
- proliferation of concepts hinders communication, but is also a particular theoretical style<br>
- too many articles only introduce another concept, and illustrate it with a case study<br>
- too few efforts to systematically combine and interrelate concepts<br>
631<br>
- Molina (1995:387) argues that "A need continues to exist for further refining and developing systematic approaches to understand complex technological processes by integrating concepts in an analytically operational way"
</p>

<h2>Too much theoretical emphasis on complexity, local practices and contingency</h2>

<br>

<p>
- SCOT and ANT were deployed against the linear model and technological determinism<br>
- further case studies to this field are suffering from diminishing returns; too much repetition of the same message<br>
- Guggenheim and Nowotny (2003) argue that this repetition stems from the role STS gave itself:
</p>

<p>
An implicit assumption of the early program was that the prevailing understanding of science and technology was flawed, and that it was the mission of STS to correct these distortions. STS took on the role of Modern Sisyphus, whose task was not only hard, but also repetitive. Because scientists and "society" continue to make "wrong" claims about science and technology, STS's task is never-ending. But claims about complexity, contingency, local situatedness, and messiness may become repetitious and unsurprising.
</p>

<p>
MRT suggests a new theoretical avenue, aimed at finding patterns, regularities and stylized mechanisms. This avenue accepts and cherishes the importance of complexity, messiness and local practices, but maintains that (inter)actions in many local practices can add up to patterns and regularities at a global level. The task of MRT is thus to stylize and simplify complexity.
</p>

<h2>Theoretical styles</h2>

<br>

<p>
Theory is not only about concepts and propositions, but also about style. DiMaggio (1995) usefully distinguished three styles.<br>
- First: "theory as covering laws" (variance theory): the world is approached as made up of variables; the aim is to explain variance rather than regularities.<br>
632<br>
- theory attempts to cover "laws" and correlations between variables<br>
- hardly practiced by STS, for good reasons<br>
- but bread and butter of economists, psychologists and many mainstream sociologists<br>
- Second: "theory as enlightenment:" aims to clear away conventional notions and assumptions to make room for artful and exciting new perspectives<br>
- theory may be defamiliarizing, rich in paradox, deconstructing accepted assumptions<br>
- ANT, SCOT and reflexivity approaches have these characteristics<br>
- third: theory as narrative (process theory): these theories give an account of a social process, allowing entities (actors, structures) to change their identity during the process, which is seen as interpreted and enacted<br>
- these theories care less about the variance explained, and more about empirical tests of the plausibility of the narrative. <br>
- requires that hypotheses detailing regularities in relations among variables be accompanied by plausible accounts of how the actions of real humans could produce the associations predicted and observed<br>
- much STS work belongs also to this style
</p>

<p>
- these styles differ with regard to criteria for "good theory"<br>
- Weick (1999) proposes that all theories make tradeoffs between three criteria:
</p>

<p>
<ol type="1" start="1">
<li>Generality/scope</li>
<li>Simplicity/parsimony (Ockham's razor)</li>
<li>accuracy/specificity</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
- generally "pick any two" situation<br>
- covering law theories generally strong in generality and parsimony, but weak in accuracy<br>
- narratives are more complicated, tradeoffs between accuracy and simplicity are common in ethnography, cases, and idiographic inquiry<br>
- SCOT is general and simple, but not very accurate/specific<br>
633<br>
- theories as enlightenment are more difficult and may criticize the three criteria for "good" theory; ANT for instance doubts the importance of simplicity, valuing e.g. creativity, revelatory power, appeal, and surprise
</p>

<p>
I conclude from this discussion that two important STS theories (SCOT and ANT) are characterized by a gap between relatively simple, sensitizing conceptual schemes and detailed, complex case descriptions with some empirical generalizations. This is not exactly similar to Merton's gap between grand theory and abstracted empiricism. The theories are not<br>
634<br>
elaborate and grand (although ontological ambitions are) and empirical data are not abstracted (but detailed and full of life). It is a gap nevertheless.
</p>

<p>
In a review of theories of technological change, Rip and Kemp (1998) diagnosed: "The new history and sociology of technology has shed light on forgotten views and failed technological directions, but it has not progressed very far in the direction of theory. ... At this stage, explanations of the eventual shape of technology tend to be glosses on specific case studies, informed by general sociological theories" (p. 358-9)
</p>

<p>
- similar problems may plague sociology more widely; much modern social theory has a tendency to label, relabel, and to describe rather than to explain (HedstrÃ¶m and Swedberg 1998:1)
</p>

<p>
Sociology finds it hard to abstract because "unlike the humanities and economics, sociology places high value on empirical truth, perhaps too high a value" (Davis 1994:182). There is a strong belief in explanations that provide accounts of what happens as it actually happens.
</p>

<p>
- HedstrÃ¶m and Swedberg (1998) advocate the search for medium-scope patterns and mechanisms; distinguish between a complex social reality and an intentionally simplified analytical model of this reality
</p>

<p>
"The standard sociological critique of analytical theory focuses on the reality of its assumptions. ... But criticizing an analytical model for lack of realism is a common sense instance of the logical fallacy, which consists of mistaking the abstract for the concrete. ... All models by their very nature distort the reality they are intended to describe. The choice must be guided by how useful the various analytical models are for particular purposes." (HedstrÃ¶m and Swedberg 1998:14-15)
</p>

<p>
- note that mechanisms are not same as laws: mechanisms are based on actions not correlations between variables.
</p>

<h2>Middle range theory in STS</h2>

<br>

<p>
- MRT in STS would have the following characteristics:<br>
- It would not address the whole of science and technology, but focus on limited themes and topics<br>
- It would make explicit efforts to combine different concepts in ana analytical model<br>
- It would search for patterns and explanatory mechanisms
</p>

<p>
- On generality and scope, MRT is between empirical generalisations and theories that address the whole of science and technology<br>
- On simplicity, MRT does not consist of complicated, elaborate conceptual frameworks, nor of general, fuzzy concepts; instead, it is about a limited number of related concepts<br>
- On accuracy, MRT is about propositions with a clear link to empirical cases; but the patterns and mechanisms are abstract, and accept some loss of empirical complexity
</p>

<p>
Middle range theorizing in STS is not just a wish or empty program. Substantial achievements have already been made, although these are not always visible, because they are published in book chapters or journals outside the "STS core." 
</p>

<h2>STS achievements in middle range theory</h2>

<br>

<h3>The Role of Expectations and Promises in Technology dynamics</h3>

<br>

<p>
- scholars addressing the role of expectations in technological change:<br>
- Van Lente and Rip, 1998<br>
- Brown and Michael 2003<br>
- Special issue in Technology Analysis &amp; Strategic Management, 2006, No. 2-3<br>
- Expectations can act as self-fulfilling prophecies, because they guide social actions in technological change<br>
- this is an MRT, because it focuses on a particular topic, specifies relationships between concepts and has clear mechanisms<br>
636<br>
- promise-requirement cycle is a mechanisms that explains patterns such as the hype-cycle
</p>

<p>
637
</p>

<p>
638
</p>

<h3>Niche Theory and Emerging Technical Trajectories</h3>

<br>

<p>
- strategic niche management literature, at the boundary of STS and evolutionary economics, has conceptualized the dynamics of technological niches through an eclectic combination of STS concepts (Schot, 1998; Kemp, Schot, and Hoogma 1998)<br>
639
</p>

<p>
641
</p>

<h3>Multi-level perspective on sociotechnical transitions</h3>

<br>

<p>
- shifts from one sociotechnical system to another at the level of societal functions<br>
- many STS scholars have focused on emergence of new technologies and systems, but less attention has been given to the shift from old to new sociotechnical systems
</p>

<p>
642
</p>

<p>
- MLP builds on Rip and Kemp 1998<br>
- distinguishes three analytical levels:<br>
- niche level that accounts for the emergence of new innovations<br>
- sociotechnical regime that accounts for the stability of existing systems<br>
- sociotechnical landscape that accounts for exogenous macro-developments
</p>
