- early plastics researchers focused on creating credible substitutes for ivory<br>
- Baekeland at last succeeded in making artificial billiard balls<br>
- Friedel (1983) has made a detailed analysis of the scarcity of ivory in the 2nd half of the 19th century <br>
(Friedel, R. (1983) Pioneer Plastic. The Making and Selling of Celluloid. Madison: University of Wisconsin Press.)<br>
- conclusion is that although the widely perceived "ivory problem" in the 19th century was largely a myth,  there might well have been a "billiard ball problem" <br>
- balls required extremely high quality ivory (sometimes 1 tusk out of 50 was suitable) and made the largest source of demand <br>
- this could well have added to scarcity<br>
- new York billiard ball producers Phelan and Callander offered a $10000 award for substitute ivory

<p>
3.7 Different degrees of inclusion in a technological frame<br>
- Baekeland was a member of different relevant social groups: e.g. photo chemists and of electrochemists, and pioneering motorists<br>
143<br>
If an actor has a high degree of inclusion, this means that she thinks, acts, and interacts to a large extent in terms of that technological frame. It is expected that actors who are contemporaneously member of different relevant social groups will have different degrees of inclusion in the associated technological frames. <br>
- there are no easy measures of the degree of inclusion
</p>

<br>
<br>

<p>
- Baekeland sketched a nicely linear development from Bayer via Kleeberg to Luft and Story
</p>

- almost at the same time that Baekelands patents were issued, other researchers filed patents for similar products<br>
- SIMULTANEOUS DISCOVERY<br>

the existence of celluloid technological frame used to explain the stability of the "celluloid world"
</p>

<p>
282
</p>

<p>
An important element of any technological frame is the exemplary artifact, ...<br>
An artifact in the role of exemplar (that is, after closure, when it is part of a technological frame) has become obturate. The relevant social groups have, in building up the technological frame, invested so much in the artifact that its meaning has become quite fixed - it cannot be changed easily, and it forms part of a hardened network of practices, theories, and social institutions. From this time on it may indeed happen that, naively spoken, an artifact "determines" social development. 
</p>

<p>
To analyze the obduracy of sociotechnical ensembles, it is also helpful to look at artifacts and ensembles in their role as boundary objects (Star 1988). Part of the closure and stabilization process is the creation of inside/outside boundaries. The concept of "inclusion" is used to describe the boundary area between inside and outside: Actors with a high degree of inclusion are more to the inside than actors with a lower degree of inclusion. (Law and Bijker 1992)
</p>

<p>
284
</p>

<p>
- artifacts are "hard" for actors with high inclusion, "but in the very specific sense of enabling and constraining interaction and thinking. It was not hard in the sense of having one fixed, monolithic meaning.
</p>

<p>
For actors with low inclusion, the situation is quite different: The sociotechnical ensemble, as an element of a technological frame, does not guide their interactions and thinking very strictly, but it does have a relatively undifferentiated, monolithic meaning.
</p>

<p>
For actorswith low inclusion, the artifact presents a "take it or leave it" situation. They cannot modify the artifact if they "take" it, but life can go on quite well if they "leave" it. For highly included actors, on the contrary, there is no life without the exemplary artifact, but there is a lot of life within it. The obduracy of artifacts as boundary objects for actors with low inclusion consists in this "take it or leave it" character. For such actors, there is no flexibility and there is no differentiated insight; there is only technology, determining life to some extent and allowing at best an "all or nothing" choice. This is the obduracy of technology that most people know best, and it is what gives rise to technological determinism.
</p>

<p>
- MacKenzie (1990) analyzed uncertainty similarly: he observed high uncertainty about technology and science among two groups of actors: those with high inclusion (Bijker's term) and those with low inclusion. In between, he conjectured a "certainty through" may exist. Bijker's analysis suggests that the uncertainty at the right hand end of the curve is due to the obduracy of the sociotechnical ensembles in the "take it or leave it" sense, while at the left-hand end it is due to their high differentiation for highly included actors. <br>

</p>

<p>
Misa (1988) argues that studies on a micro level will generally deconstruct technological determinism, while analyses on a macro level tend to produce technologically deterministic accounts. <br>

</p>

<p>
Star (1988) introduced the term "boundary object" as "objects which are both plastic enough to adapt to local needs and constraints of the several parties employing them, yet robust enough to maintain a common identity across sites." Star discusses various types of boundary objects: repositories (e.g. a museum's collection), platonic objects (for example, a geographical map), standardized labels (e.g. protocols for intake of patients) <br>

</p>

<p>
Law and Bijker (1992) discuss how the view of creating inside/outside boundaries relates to various approaches in recent technology studies. BUT IS THIS ONLY ABOUT INCLUSION OF ACTORS, NOT OF TECHNICAL POSSIBLE?<br>
