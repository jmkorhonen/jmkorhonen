<p>
Increased resource consumption can cause resource scarcities, and scarcities impose costs on societies. But experts debate the severity of future scarcities and human capacity to adapt to them. There are three main positions in this debate (see, e.g. Barbier 1989; Matthael 1984). Neo-Malthusians, who are often biologists or ecologists, claim that finite natural resources place strict limits on the growth of human population and consumption; if these limits are exceeded, poverty and social breakdown result. Many neoclassical economists, in contrast, say that there need be few, if any, strict limits to human population, consumption, and prosperity (note 1). Properly functioning economic institutions, especially markets, provide incentives to encourage conservation, resource substitution, development of new stores of scarce resources, and technological innovation (note 2). Finally, analysts whom I call "distributionists" acknowledge that there may 588 be resource limits to human population growth, but for them the real problem is the maldistribution of resources and wealth. Poverty and inequality, in their view, are the cause, not the consequence, of high population growth rates and practices that deplete resources (see, e.g. Lappe and Collins 1977; Blaikle 1985; Boyce 1987).
</p>

<p>
This three-cornered debate has become sterile. In most popular accounts, the protagonists are arch-optimists like Julian Simon, who believe that scarcities pose no bounds to human prosperity, and arch-pessimists like Paul Ehrlich, who argue that the human population is already far too large for the Earth's resource base (Simon 1981; Simon and Kahn 1984; Ehrlich and Ehrlich 1991). Although these bitter exchanges accomplish little, the paradigms underpinning the three positions have great influence. In particular, the neoclassical view guides the responses of the World Bank and other multilateral development agencies to resource problems in poor countries, and it informs commentary in influential business-oriented newspapers, magazines and books.
</p>

<p>
Neoclassical economists stress the extraordinary ability of human beings to surmount scarcity and improve their lot. ... By this view, if we want to judge whether human beings can prosper in the future, we should ask two questions: What factors determine wealth production? And will these factors allow human beings to surmount scarcities in the future as they have often done in the past?
</p>

<p>
- the article builds on insights derived from "new economic growth theory" or "endogenous growth theory" (e.g. Romer 1994; Helpman 1992) - this theory argues that ideas, as embodied in new technologies, are a factor of economic production in addition to capital, labor, and land - ideas have independent productive power - also argue that productive ideas area not exogenously given to economic actors but are, at least in part, endogenously generated by the actors and the economic system - the article adopts and extends these arguments - Homer-Dixon contends that technological ideas are not the only productive ideas: just as important are ideas about social organization, especially about reforming and building institutions - argues that the generation and dissemination of productive ideas is endogenous not just to the economic system but also to the broader social system that includes a society's politics and culture - the focus here is on the generation of ideas, or "ingenuity" in response to resource scarcity - the central question is: can humans be smart enough at the right times and places - can they generate and disseminate enough ingeuinty - to keep scarcity from negatively affecting their wellbeing?
</p>

<p>
589
</p>

<p>
- first discuss what is meant by scarcity - then identifies some factors that affect the requirement for and the supply of ingenuity - argues that in some societies, resource scarcity can simultaneously increase the requirement and impede supply, producing an "ingenuity gap" that may have critical consequences for adaptation and, in turn, social stability
</p>

<p>
- the argument here is heuristic and illuminative, as there are no precise measures for ingenuity
</p>

<p>
<div style='padding-left: 60pt'>
The nature and role of ingenuity
</div>
</p>

<p>
- the role of ideas, innovation and ingenuity in economic growth has been argued over by economists for years - Solow (1957) examined contributions of physical capital and labor to growth; showed a sizable residual could not be explained by accumulation of these factors; attributed the difference to technology - economists still dispute whether the innovative ideas embodied in technology have an independent productive role that would explain the "Solow residual" or whether the contribution of ideas can be subsumed under growth in conventional factors of production, particularly growth in human capital (i.e. knowledgeable and productive labor force)
</p>

<p>
- Romer, one of the leaders of the new economic growth school, argues: "Ideas are the instructions that let us combine limited physical resources in arrangements that are ever more valuable (1993b:64). - argues ideas cannot be reduced to human capital, because ideas are nonrival, whereas human capital is rival (a good is nonrival if its use by one actor does not limit its use by another) - key consequence: although ideas may be expensive to produce the first time, they can then be infinitely replicated and accumulated at very low cost
</p>

<p>
<div style='padding-left: 60pt'>
What is ingenuity?
</div>
</p>

<p>
- the central concept in the article - means "ideas applied to solve practical social and technical problems" - a more subtle definition than it first appears - explicitly narrower than "ideas:" refers only to ideas used to solve practical problems 591 - broader than "innovation," since innovation implies novelty; and, although ingenuity does not exclude novelty, practical ideas do not have to be novel to be classified here as ingenuity
</p>

<p>
Whether an idea can be classified as ingenuity is not, by the above definition, a function of the success of the solutions it produces; thus, on occasion, a solution that uses more ingenuity - that uses, in other words, more ideas - might not work as well as a solution that uses less ingenuity. Moreover, ingenuity, as I use the term here, does not convey a judgment about the intrinsic quality or productivity of ideas. An increase in the ingenuity supplied by a society means simply an increase in the number of ideas it applies to its practical problems, not an increase in the quality of the ideas.
</p>

<p>
- for simplicity, focuses only on the aggregate supply of ideas that a society applies to its practical problems
</p>

<p>
<div style='padding-left: 60pt'>
Ingenuity and scarcity
</div>
</p>

<p>
- takes ingenuity to be a factor of production, like labor, capital and land (i.e. natural resources), just as new economic growth theorists 592 - ingenuity often substitutes for labor and land by raising their productivity
</p>

<p>
- need to distinguish between technical and social ingenuity
</p>

<p>
In industrial societies, resource scarcities are usually seen as technological challenges needing the keen attention of scientists and engineers ...
</p>

<p>
But the supply of this technical ingenuity depends on an adequate supply of social ingenuity at many levels of society. Social ingenuity is key to the creation, reform, and maintenance of public and semipublic goods such as markets, funding agencies, educational and research organizations, and effective government. If operating well, this system of institutions provides psychological and material incentives to technological entrepreneurs and innovators; it aids regular contact and communication among experts; and it channels resources preferentially to those endeavors with the greatest prospect of success. Social ingenuity is a precursor to technical ingenuity (note 7). Society therefore needs ingenuity to get ingenuity, which means it is both an input to and output of the economic system.
</p>

<p>
- social ingenuity also key to adaptation strategies that do not involve new technologies
</p>

<p>
593
</p>

<p>
- defines the requirement for ingenuity in response to a given resource scarcity as the "constant-satisfaction requirement," which is the amount needed to compensate for any aggregate social disutility caused by the scarcity. It is, in other words, the minimum amount of ingenuity that a society needs to maintain its current aggregate level of satisfaction in spite of the scarcity (note 10). The constant-satisfaction requirement is not an economic constraint in the real world; rather it is an arbitrary, analytical benchmark against which we can evaluate society's delivery of ingenuity (note 11).
</p>

<p>
Many people who are optimistic about human ability to surmount resource scarcity implicity use this constant-satisfaction benchmark: they argue that, with well-functioning economic institutions like markets, the level of satisfaction in a society over the medium and long run will not decrease despite occasional resource shortages. In other words, these optimists assume that ingenuity will be supplied abundantly and cheaply enough to alleviate any disutility arising from scarcity and that the society will demand at least this amount of ingenuity.
</p>

<p>
At any point in time, the constant-satisfaction requirement for ingenuity is partly a function of how far into the future we project this requirement. If we are concerned with maintaining constant satisfaction only into the near future, the present need for ingenuity might be quite limited. For example, if consumption currently exceeds the flow of a renewable resource, we might be able to tap the resource's underlying stock - and thus maintain our satisfaction for the short term - without radically changing our institutions, behavior, and technology. On the other hand, if we want to ensure constant satisfaction far into the future, ourpresent need for ingenuity might be much higher
</p>

<p>
- defines the supply of ingenuity as the amount actually delivered by the economic and social system - this amount is determined by the price society is willing to pay for it and by numerous other variables, including availability of financial and intellectual capital, society's capacity to generate practical knowledge, and the willingness of society to undergo social and technological change.
</p>

<p>
594
</p>

<p>
- two stages: the generation and delivery/implementation of the potential solution - supply can be hindered at both stages
</p>

<p>
In the remainder of this article I argue that, as resource scarcity worsens, the social and technological problems faced by societies generally become more complex, unpredictable, and urgent. These changes tend to raise the constant-satisfaction requirement for ingenuity; in other words, greater scarcity increases the need for ingenuity to maintain aggregate social satisfaction. Greater scarcity also often boosts the supply of ingenuity by inducing changes in resource prices that, in turn, provide incentives to social and technological entrepreneurs. This increased supply can alleviate scarcity's severity and social impacts
</p>

<p>
- OTOH four factors that can restrict ingenuity's supply: - market failure - social friction - shortages of capital - constraints on science
</p>

<p>
- argues, therefore, that some societies will eventually experience a chronic "ingenuity gap" between their requirement for and their supply of ingenuity
</p>

<p>
<div style='padding-left: 60pt'>
Some factors increasing the requirement for ingenuity
</div>
</p>

<p>
For many resources, both regionally and globally, population growth and increasing per capita resource consumption are causing a steady increase in the ratio of the consumption of the resource per unit of time to the total amount of the resource available (note 13). This consumption/resource ratio is an approximate but useful measure of a resource's scarcity (note 14).
</p>

<p>
595
</p>

<p>
The ingenuity requirement to compensate for scarcities of renewables is generally greater than that for nonrenewables (note 17). Most renewables are embedded in highly complex, dynamic systems of resources. The overextraction of one resource in such a system can produce ramifying scarcities in the surrounding ecological system. As a result, the economic disruption caused by renewable resource scarcity is arguably foten greater than that caused by nonrenewable scarcity: an economy not only has to find substitutes for goods and services provided by the scarce resource itself, it also often has to find substitutes for the goods and services that are causally dependent upon the resource.
</p>

<p>
- e.g. forests
</p>

<p>
596
</p>

<p>
As scarcities become more acute, societies will face an increasingly complex, unpredictable, and urgent decisionmaking environment that will boost the constant-satisfaction requirement for social and technical ingenuity.
</p>

<p>
- Perrow's work on breakdowns in human-managed systems provides two useful concepts: "complex interaction" (multiple and often unanticipated causal linkages and feedbacks among subsystems within a larger system) and "tight coupling" (little slack or buffering capacity between events and processes) - Perrow argues that systems with both of these characteristics are unforgiving: a shock propagates rapidly and unpredictably through its components (Perrow 1984:62-100)
</p>

<p>
- maintaining satisfaction as consumption/resource ratios increase, humans will need to run resource systems ever more efficiently - system optimization will often demand tightly coupled and highly interactive horizontal and vertical management (note 20) - this will require great ingenuity
</p>

<p>
But even if the requisite ingenuity is supplied, the systems will still be vulnerable to sudden shocks, because many scarcities are interconnected and unpredictable, ... and because efficiency and productivity requirements will tend to compress the time between events, reduce opportunities for recovery, and increase interactions between system elements (note 22).
</p>

Some factors limiting the supply of ingenuity
</div>
</p>

<p>
- past 200 years brought major material and social progress for most of the humanity - why should the future be any different?
</p>

<p>
Many optimists implicitly assume that the price elasticity of supply of human ingenuity is nearly infinite, which suggests that an increase in demand for ingenuity will produce an equal increase in quantity supplied with no increase in price (note 24). Neoclassical economists have also traditionally assumed that ingenuity - or "technology," as they usually call it - is available exogenously: it is a free public good that individuals, firms, and organizations access as necessary (Fagerberg 1994:1149). These economists do not explicitly address where the technology originally comes from.
</p>

<p>
Other analysts argue that ingenuity is generated endogenously. There are several distinct perspectives here. Induced innovation theorists, such as the agricultural economists Yujiro Hayami and Vernon Ruttan (1971, 1985), propose that changes in factor endowments, notably of land, labor, and energy, are reflected in market price signals. These signals in turn stimulate technological innovations that loosen constraints on agricultural growth. Ruttan and Hayami (1984) acknowledge the critical intervening role - between price and technological innovation - of social institutions like property rights, financial agencies, and markets. However, they argue that demand for new institutions is largely determined, once again, by changes in factor endowments.
</p>

<p>
- Ester Boserup (1965, 1990) also argues that cropland scarcity induced by population growth increases the input of labor into agricultural production and stimulates land-saving cahnges in cropping practices (and eventually lead to markets and specialization)
</p>

<p>
- Simon (1981) contends that larger populations mean more heads to generate the ideas that help societies overcome resource scarcity

<p>
<div style='padding-left: 60pt'>
Conclusions
</div>
</p>

<p>
- argues that understanding the determinants of social adaptation to resource scarcity requires examination of the role of ingenuity, and several factors can limit the supply of that - other analysts might argue that scarcity will tend to stimulate a sufficient flow of ingenuity to offset these factors
</p>

<p>
- argument here allows us to synthesize the three seemingly irreconcilable positions mentioned at the beginning of the article:
</p>

<p>
- neo-Malthusians emphasize physical causes of scarcity and poverty - neoclassical economists and distributionists emphasize social causes like ineffective markets, bad economic and social policies, and skewed resource distribution among classes and groups
</p>

<p>
605
</p>

<p>
- integrates both types of variables - social improvements such as better markets and resource distribution, which are products of ingenuity, often alleviate scarcity - but a society's capacity to make these improvements will be partly determined by scarcity itself, which is powerfully influenced by the society's physical context
</p>

<p>
The limits a society faces are a result of the interaction of the society's physical context with the ingenuity the society can bring to bear on that context. If humans could supply infinite ingenuity, then the maximum sustainable limit for population and consumption would be determined by physical law.
</p>

<p>
...since the supply of ingenuity depends on many social and economic factors and can therefore vary widely, we cannot determine a society's limits solely by examining its physical context. Rather than speaking of limits, therefore, it is better to say that some societies are locked into a race between a rising requirement for ingenuity and their capacity to supply it.
