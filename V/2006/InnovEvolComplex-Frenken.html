Properties of fitness landscapes
</p>

<p>
K is a measure of complexity. It tells by how many elements each element N is affected, If K = 0, the system has minimum complexity as no other elements are affected. The system is then said to have no epistasis. On the other hand, if K reaches its maximum value at K=N-1, then all elements are epistatically related, the fitness landscape is fully random, and the system’s complexity reaches its maximum. 
</p>

<p>
Some analytical results can be derived for this latter case (see Kauffman 1993 and Frenken 2006: 15 for more details). For our purposes, the most important result is that K=N-1 systems tend towards the mean fitness value 0.5 as N increases. If the system is of infinite size (N=∞), the fitness of the system is exactly 0.5 Kauffman (1993: 54) notes this as a case of a “complexity catastrophe,” as large complex systems with significant interconnections between elements tend to function less well than less complex systems with less constraints. Formally, this is because increasing N and K increase the number of local optima as well (Kauffman 1993). Consequently, the higher the complexity of a system and the larger the size of a system, the more likely agents are to become trapped in local optima 
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, in most cases analytical results cannot be derived for the more interesting case of complex systems that have non-random fitness landscapes, i.e. K&lt;N-1. Simulation results, however, have found significant insights into the behavior of complex NK systems as complexity K increases (Kauffman 1993; Altenberg 1997; Frenken 2006):<br>
<ol type="1" start="1">
<li>Number of local optima increases exponentially, and finding local, instead of global optimum becomes increasingly likely.</li>
<li>Local optima become more randomly spread in design space as they have less and less elements in common.</li>
<li>Mean fitness peaks as systems reach positive but moderate complexity (depending on N, around K = 2…4), declining towards 0.5 as K increases towards infinity. This can be understood as reflecting the fact that small K-values create, on average, positive complementaries, but increasing complexity poses increasingly more incompatible design constraints.</li>
<li>The variance of fitness levels of local optima falls as complexity K increases.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
Finally, the higher the fitness value of a local optimum in a landscape, the higher is the probability of it being found by trial-and-error search. This is because high fitness values result to larger basin of attraction, meaning the number of strings starting from which trial-and-error can end up in the local optimum. For the purposes of innovation research, this insight, combined with insight 3, imply that systems of moderate complexity have, on average, the highest fitness values of local optima and also have fitness peaks that are more likely to be found. In practical terms, this means that the pay-off of R&amp;D investments is highest when designers deal with moderately complex systems - not when they deal with systems with either no or infinite epistasis (Frenken 2006: 15).
</p>

<p>
Frenken (2006) has extensively documented the properties of Kauffman’s original (1993) NK model and Altenberg’s important generalisations (1994, 1995, 1997), and their implications for innovation research. From this viewpoint, 
</p>

<br>
<br>
<br>

<p>
Frenken (2006:15): “The correlation between local optima as measured by the number of states of elements that two local optima have in common, decreases for increases in complexity K. This means that the higher the complexity of a system, the more randomly spread the local optima are in design space.”<br>
- would this mean that more radical innovation is required?
</p>

<p>
Determining whether a design is different from another is relatively simple, but how to determine whether a resource is high-K or not? 
</p>

<p>
“The concept of long jumps”
</p>

<p>
A model by Milgrom and Roberts (1990, 1995) FRENKEN 2006:19-20<br>
- argued that the transition from mass production to lean production required changes in a wide range of a firm’s production activities simultaneously<br>
- due to interdependencies between many activities, the transition from mass production to lean production is only successful if all these activities adapt (corresponds to a landscape of two distant local optima<br>
- a successful transition from one peak to the other requires a “long jump” involving simultaneous mutations in many elements<br>
- Gavetti and Levinthal (2005:35) give another example: low cost versus full services airlines
</p>

<p>
- long jumps on a fitness landscape reflect radical innovation, a transition of one complex technological system to a new and very different one<br>
- such transitions can take many years of search and experimentation as the location of the new peak cannot be known ex ante<br>
- the concept of long jumps provides a theoretical foundation of the phenomenon of the productivity paradox, which has been observed with the introduction of new large technological systems such as electricity or information technology (David 1990; Reinstaller and Hölzl 2004)<br>
— the impact of the introduction of these technologies has not been limited to technological change, but has also included change in organizations, regulations and skills.<br>
— this explains why these transitions take time and, initially, do not result in productivity increases
</p>

<p>
SEARCH DISTANCE AS A PARAMETER TO NK MODEL
</p>

<p>
Frenken (2006:20):<br>
Dropping the assumption that the search is completely myopic (not allowed to mutate in multiple dimensions simultaneously) introduces search distance as a parameter to NK model
</p>

<p>
Agents have to decide on the search distance they apply, without knowing ex ante what the optimal search distance is<br>
- when designers are allowed to mutate in many elements simultaneously, the definition of a local optimum will depend directly on the length of search distance designers apply (Jones 1995)
</p>

<p>
THUS, the existence of local optima is not an intrinsic property of a complex system, but depends on the way the landscape is searched. The larger the search distance, the fewer strings will count as local optima. Taken to the extreme, designers may apply a search distance of length N implying that the global optimum is eventually always found (exhaustive search). <br>
- thus, implicitly, mainstream neoclassical economics assumes economic agents to engage in exhaustive search at all times as they are capable of maximising their utility<br>
- to be certain to find the solution, needs 2^N trials<br>
- a trade-off exists between the effectiveness of a search (D = 1 -&gt; highest efficiency; D=N -&gt; lowest) regarding the result in terms of the fitness of the soution and the efficiency of search in terms of the time required to reach this solution
</p>

<p>
DECOMPOSABLE SYSTEMS (Frenken 2006:21)
</p>

<p>
Decomposable systems: a particular class of complex systems, for which exist search strategies that are certain to find the global optimum, yet are less costly than exhaustive search, that is, apply a search distance less than N<br>
- decomposable systems: Simon (1962, 1969, 2002)<br>
- systems that can be partitioned in subsystems such that all epistatic relations are located within subsystems and not between subsystems<br>
- when searching in decomposable systems, designers can apply a more time-efficient search strategy by confining their search within subsystems<br>
- ultimate degree of decomposability: system decomposed to N subsystems each containing one element; equivalent to the case of no epistatic relations at all (K = 0)
</p>

<p>
Modularity not same as decomposability!

Technical and service characteristics<br>
34<br>
In economics, functional attributes of product technologies are generally called product characteristics since Lancaster (1966, 1971, 1979, 1990) and Ironmonger (1972) introduced this concept in economic theory (endnote 29). Lancaster argued that demand for a consumer technology should be understood as demand for the bundle of service characteristics that is embodied in a product. Lancaster (1979:17) stated that “(i)ndividuals are not interested in goods for their own sake but because of the characteristics they possess.” Where Lancaster described product technology solely in terms of the quality attributes that are taken into account by users, Saviotti and Metcalfe (1984) proposed to describe technologies in terms of both technical and functional attributes in the same way as is done in genotype-phenotype maps. They speak of technical characteristics referring to the design dimensions of an artefact, and of service characteristics referring to functional attributes of an artefact. Technical characteristics are for example the type of engine, tyres and materials used in cars, which are chosen by designers. Service characteristics are for example speed, safety and comfort, which are the dimensions that users take into account when they select among products on offer. Saviotti (1996:66) speaks of an imaging pattern between technical and service characteristics, a pattern that biologists call the genotype-phenotype map and we called a technology’s architecture. Following this conceptualisation, an artefact can be considered as the “interface” between the designer who constructs the internal system and the user who makes use of the services it provides in particular user contexts (Simon 1969 [1996]:6; Saviotti 1986, 1996; Andersen 1991, 1994).

<p>
MODULARITY VERSUS DECOMPOSABILITY
</p>

<p>
Decomposability and modularity are two distinct qualities: decomposability means that a system can be partitioned into subsystems such that no interdependencies exist between subsystems. <br>
<ol type="a" start="16">
<li>36</li>
</ol>
This is no longer one system! Independent designers could design a subsystem without the need of coordination. The idea of decomposability is better understood as an analytical construct or as an approximation of systems that are at best only nearly decomposable.
</p>

<p>
A modular system is a system that cannot be partitioned into subsystems such that no interdependencies (epistatic relations) exist between subsystems, but which contains subsystems, called modules, that are mediated by interfaces. These interfaces are elements of a system that connect subsystems such that the only epistatic relations between the subsystems are via the interface standards. Modular systems can also be considered nearly decomposable systems in the sense that the majority of epistatic relations are confined to subsets of elements (Frenken et al. 1999a; Ethiraj and Levinthal 2004; Simon 2002).<br>
Decomposability can be addressed in the original NK model; modularity requires generailzed model<br>
Interface standards can be thought of as elements in complex systems that do not contribute to a specific function as their only “function” is to mediate the epistatic interactions between other elements.

THE HENDERSON-CLARK CLASSIFICATION
</p>

<p>
<ol type="a" start="16">
<li>41</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
In the NK model, modular innovation refers to mutation in elements without a change in the architecture of epistatic relations, thus moving from one string to a neighbouring string on a given fitness landscape. <br>
Architectural innovation, as defined by Henderson and Clark (1990:10) refers to a change in the way “in which the components of a product are linked toether, while leaving the core design concepts (and thus the basic knowledge underlying the components) untouched.” In the generalised NK model, architectural innovation thus entails a change in the technology’s architecture without any mutation in elements. As explained, such a change will change the shape of the fitness landscape, ain that the function that is now affected by a different set of elements acquires a new fitness value (through a random draw from a uniform distribution)<br>
Incremental innovation refers to innovation that does not involve any change in elements or in the genotype-phenotype map. This type of innovation, though not part of Altenberg’s model, can be made part of the generalised mode by assuming that fitness values can increase incrementally through time without involving modular or architectural innovations (i.e. exogenously). In technological artefacts, these small changes result from innovations at a lower system level, as particular alleles are often complex systems in themselves (Metcalfe 1995:36; Murmann and Frenken 2002). For example, a design with a gasoline engine can be improved incrementally by innovations within a gasoline engine itself, and does not involve modular or architectural innovations at the level of the car (but it involves modular or architectural innovations at the level of the gasoline engine allele).<br>
The fourth and final type of innovation is radical innovation, which simply refers to a co-occurence of modular innovation and architectural innovation. This definition is alternative to one used in Chapter 2, where radical innovation is associated with long jumps on a fitness landscape, i.e. simultaneously mutating many elements in a string. <br>
(A third possible definition of radical innovation is an innovation that produces large increases in performance; see Murmann and Frenken 2002)

What makes up a product class and what differentiates one dominant design from another? <br>
From Frenken (2006:76):<br>
“Murmann and Frenken (2002) proposed to use the concept of operational principle originally proposed by Polanyi (1962) and later adopted by Vincenti’s (1990, 1994) writings on the history of aeroplanes. An operational principle defines how the parts interact with one another in order to implement the goal of overall technology. When human beings have grasped the operational principle of a technology they know how an artefact can act on nature in a special beneficial way. Because an operational principle essentially specifies the way components need to be arranged in order to create a successful artefact, operational principles reveal the abstract logic of how an artefact works, and thus provide the starting point for understanding of th essential technical characteristics. The operational principle of an artefact sets out the relevant dimensions of what we previously called the design space of an artefact.”<br>

Operational principles allow the student of technology to categorize a set of artefacts into general product classes. … Within a product class, sub-classes can be defined by distinguishing between different operational principles used in different subsystems (e.g. propeller vs jet propulsion in aircraft)

The characteristics approach to product technology enables us to give a definition of innovation that can be the basis for an accurate measurement of innovation. In Chapter 5, we discussed the use of entropy to indicate the emergence of a dominant design in genotype space (falling entropy and falling mutual information). Contrary to the genotype of technologies, which is qualitatively described as a string of alleles, the phenotype of technologies is indicated in service levels in continuous dimensions. Indicating variety in phenotype space, that is, in terms of dimensions relevant to users, requires measurements techniques that are “distance-based”. As in Fig. 7.1 and Fig 7.2, distance in phenotype can be understood as the Euclidean distance between two products in the space of service characteristics (Frenken et al. 199b, 2000). Using this definition of distance we can use clustering algorithms to indicate the variety in a product population.

An explanation for the marked difference in aircraft and helicopter evolution can be provided by the concept of habitat. The range of service characteristics provided by a technology can be compared to the habitat of a biological species. Niche theory predicts that the number of niches that can be created in a given habitat is proportional to the size of the habitat (Saviotti 1996; Frenken et al. 1999b). A greater span of this habitat allows a greater number of niches to be created within it. An increase in the range of its performance allows a technology to become more specialised and differentiated, thus leading to an increase in variety through speciation. <br>
- why some technology might not grow to compete with another: if the technology is in a niche and R&amp;D investments aiming to increase performance would put it into competition with an already-established niche, variety might not grow

The point of departure in this study is to view technologies as complex systems containing elements that function interdependently. Complexity can be expressed by the matrix of interdependencies between elements in complex systems, called a system’s architecture. The interdependencies or “epistatic relations” imply that the choice of one element affects the functioning of other elements. The design question then becomes in what combinations is the colective functioning of elements optimal. The design process can therefore be considered to be a combinatorial optimisation problem. The complexity of the design process stems from the combinatorial explosion of the number of possible designs that can be assembled from a given set of possible states of elements. <br>
129<br>
The optimal design can generally only be found by means of exhaustive search (except when the problem is perfectly decomposable as measured by the “cover size” of a system). The exhaustive search strategy being extremely time-consuming, designers usually follow non-exhaustive search strategies that lead to sub-optimal solutions.<br>
- Three innovation patterns: <br>
…<br>
- exploring a nearly decomposable system as if it were a perfectly decomposable system, a thesis first put forward by Simon (1962, 1969, 2002). By ignoring the sparse interdependencies between subsystems, these satisficing agents are able to increase their fitness much faster than optimising agents who (rightly) regard the system as non-decomposable.<br>
- function space search opposed to design space search: <br>
Contrary to biological evolution, information on selecting conditions in function space can be used to guide human search. By doing so, technologies can be designed with reference to preferences of specific user groups. At the same time, these preferences act as a way to reduce the combinatorial explosion in the number of possible designs by focusing search on functions that are most demanded. <br>
- a model of technological paradigms based on the notion of constructional selection:<br>
The architecture of a complex system then emerges endogenously as a by-product of selection. In particular, constructional selection controls the pleiotropy of newly added elements in such a way that high-pleiotropy elements emerge at the beginning of the process (exploiting complementarities), while elements added later have lower pleiotropy (preserving complementarities created in the past). This model explains why path dependence and irreversibility in the choice of core technologies occur, even in the absence of network externalities that are generally held responsible for this. Furthermore, the model of technological paradigms explains that with the emergence of a paradigm, innovation does not stop, but shifts from core to peripheral elements. <br>
- thus, the rate of innovation does not necessarily fall over time. 
</p>

<p>
130<br>
- a phenomenon only recently seriously attended to in innovation literature is the phenomenon of technological speciation:<br>
Often, radical innovations do not lead to the replacement of one technological paradigm by a new paradigm. Rather, the introduction of a new paradigm leads the industry to bifurcate into two technological species serving different user groups. This means that we must consider the case in which the industry is dominated by a single paradigm as a special case in which demand heterogeneity is relatively low and/or scale economies are relatively high (Frenken et al. 1999b).
