<p>
A description of a 1840s copper mine in Cornwall.
</p>

<p>
Contains a section TREATMENT OF COPPER ORES:
</p>

<p>
113
</p>

<p>
The treatment of different ores should vary with their qualities, but the processes are essentially the same; but, as the limits of this paper will not permit me to specify all the modifications in detail, I shall restrict myself to designating the operations to which pyritous ores, ores containing but a small proportion of sulphur, and gray or argentiferous copper, are subjected in different countries.
</p>

<p>
The treatment of the first two varieties begins with a sorting by hand, which consists in putting aside all the fragments as large as hen's eggs, and from amongst them to separate and reject the stony pieces. Those which remain are broken according to their size, and all are reduced to fragments not larger than walnuts. Another selection or picking over is then made, for the purpose of sorting them according to their richness, and rejecting those which are altogether stony. The others for three qualities, viz: 1st, fragments of pure ore; 2d, fragments slightly intermixed with foreign matter; and 3d, fragments of the poorest kind. This sorting is more or less rigorous, according to the expense of the subsequent treatment, consisting of the price of fuel, manual labour, transportation, &amp;c.
</p>

<p>
No. 1 is broken on a cast-iron bed, by means of a batte or flat beater, (formed of a piece of iron, six inches square and one inch thick, adapted to a wooden handle,) into fragments not larger than filberts. The selection and breaking are usually done by women and children. when this is completed, the ore is ready for calcination. No. 1 is called prills in Cornwall. No. 2 the dredge ore, (as it is termed,) is spalled by the batte, and then sent to the workshops to bi riddled (sifted) and washed. No. 3 (the halvans or leavings) is sent to the crushing mills.
</p>

<p>
Breaking and screening ores.
</p>

<p>
In Cornwall, the ores at many establishments are broken by means of crushing mills, instead of being broken by battes. As the crushed ore falls from the crushing rollers or cylinders, it is received in an inclined cylindrical sieve, which, by turning on its axis, permits the larger sized ore to slide down to the bottom, while the smaller pass through its meshes. The pieces which do not pass through the sieve are returned to the crushers.
</p>

<p>
The small pieces of ore separated in the first selection, and from which all fragments larger than hen's eggs were sorted, are then sifted on an iron wire riddle; the intervals between the wires are about five lines. A workman, by repeated shaking of the riddle, filled with ore, and immersed in running water, separates it into three parts; 1st. The fine particles, which are carried off by the current, and deposited in a distant portion of the pool. 2d. The frag-<br>
114<br>
ments, which are deposited under the riddle. 3d. The largest pieces, which remain on the riddle. The last are spread out on a table, and assorted by hand. The fragments not rejected as too poor are then broken, and resubmitted to the above-named operations. 
</p>

<p>
The ore deposited under the riddle is resifted, and the No. 2 (broken when the separation into three classes was made) is added. The meshes of the sieve are from twenty to thirty to the square inch. The workman who manages it shakes it by two handles, with a compound motion, both round and vertically, immersed in a shallow pool of water, above which it is never lifted. The finest particles pass through the sieve; those that remain above it are divided, by the difference of their specific gravities, into three parts. the lightest, which is above, contains so little metal that it is thrown away; the middle portion is sent to the stamping mills; and the lower part, the richest of all, accumluated during two or three siftings, needs only to be placed on a slightly inclined plane, and to be stirred with a rake while it is washed by a small stream of water flowing gently over it. This operation, which is called "jigging," is at most of the well-regulated Cornish mines performed by machinery. A rectangular sieve is suspended in a box of the same shape, filled with water, and a vibratory motion is communicated to the sieve by a working rod, connected either with a water wheel or a steam engine, as may be most convenient. The old method is still followed on the continent, and may still be seen in England at the smaller mines. 
</p>

<p>
The fine ore passed through the sieve is separated into two parts by stirring in water. The richest, fallen to the bottom, requires but one washing. Finally, the different classifications of ores sent to the crushing and stamping mills, and separated from the non-metalliferous substances with which they were mixed, by stirrings and washings on inclined planes, constitute the prepared ores, ready for sale and reduction; while the stony parts, which always retain some ore, are thrown away.
</p>

<p>
- Also, a description of roasting in open air:
</p>

<p>
115
</p>

<p>
In the case of calcining, in heaps, in the open air - the ore is piled up in great masses in the form of truncated quadrangular pyramids, with the fuel at the bototm. In the centre of the mound is a wooden chimney, with charcoal at the bottom: an opening is left in the middle of each side, through which a current of air is admitted under the wooden chimney, by which means ignition is produced, when fire is thrown down the chimney, and combustion supported. This pyramid is covered with mortar, sods, &amp;c., and hemispheprical cavities are dug on the upper surface, for the purpose of receiving the sulphur which, during the roasting of ore, arrives liquified at the surface. This method of roasting, which is practicable only when the ore is very sulphurous, is employed at Chessy, near Lyons, in France, and at Goslar, in the Lower Hartz. It lasts about six months, at the end of which period the sulphur ceases to escape. The mass is then left to cool, and when this is accomplished the ore is fit for smelting.
