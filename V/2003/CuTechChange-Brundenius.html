From Brundenius (2003:22):<br>
"<br>
INCO's development of oxygen flash smelting technology is an example of radical technical change necessitated by the exhaustion of possibilities for further efficiency improvements in conventional technologies. INCO developed the autogenous smelting of sulphide ores using tonnage oxygen in the 1950s in an effort to improve throughput capacity and reduce energy demands at its Copper Cliff nickel and copper smelters in Ontario (Queneau and Marcuson 1996). Experimentation and refinenment of oxygen-enriched smelting and converting continued over the next three decades and, in the early 1990s, flash smelting was adopted by INCO as a central component of an extensive smelter modernization programme at Copper Cliff. Having reached the limits of efficiency improvements with existing technology, and unable to meet increasingly stringent regulations as part of an intensive acid rain abatement programme by the Ontario Environment Ministry (which stipulated a maximum annual SO2 emission rate of 265 kilotins from the Sudbury operations), INCO invested over $US530 million in rebuilding the smelter complex (INCO 1996). 
</p>

<p>
Two new flash smelters were commissioned at Copper Cliff in 1994. These produce a concentrated SO2 off-gas stream which can be efficiently captured and fixed as sulphuric acid. Currently over 90 per cent of the sulphur in the Sudbury ores is contained, compared to a containment rate of around 70 per cent before the modernization programme. The new smelters replaced aged and inefficient reverberartory furnaces that had become the greatest single source of environmental pollution in North America. While modernization was designed primarily to meet the Ontario government's 1994 deadline for air quality compliance, the redesigned smelter complex has also provided significant productivity benefits. These stem from both the flash smelting technology itself (which utilizes the exotermic properties of sulphide ores and requires very little additional fuel) as well as from efficiencies created through redesign of the process flowsheet. Taken together, these changes have not only reduced SO2 emissions at Sudbury by over 100 000 t/pa but also have helped transform the company into one of the world's lowest-cost producers (Warhurst 1994b).  
</p>

<p>
24<br>
Inco regarded flash smelter primarily as a means for reducing its own production costs for nickel smelting (and hence guarded it as a source of competitive advantage).Outokumpu decided early on to aggressively market its technology to other mineral producers. (Brundenius 2003:24)<br>
39<br>
Brundenius (2003:39): The cost advantage of the flash smelter to INCO in the nickel market has made the company very selective in how it markets flash smelting technology. To date INCO has not licensed its flash smelting technology to any other nickel smelting firms and the only license agreements are with copper producers (Phelps Dodge - formerly Kennecott - at Hurley in New Mexico; and ASARCO Hayden - now Grupo Mexico - in Arizona). This primarily reflects INCO's orientation as a metals producing firm, as opposed to a technology supply firm (telephone interview with Bob Butler, director of engineering, INCO, Mississauga, Ontario, 1996).

Chile
</p>

<p>
Although copper has been mined and produced in Chile since colonial days, it was primarily with the entry of US-based companies at the beginning of the twentieth century that copper output substantially increased. Chile Exploration Company... developed the huge Chuquicamata deposits in the desert areas of norther Chile. ... Production started in 1910, initially with the treatment of oxide ores. This was a giant challenge at the time since the deposits consisted of low-grade oxide and sulphide ores, requiring a host of new technologies and huge investments for open pit mining. Later on, in 1923, the mine was sold to another US-based firm, Anaconda Copper Company, which at that time also owned the Andes Copper Mining Company (with the Potrerillos deposits, and later also the El Salvador deposits.) The present Chuquicamata smelter was brought on line in 1953 with the transfer of mining to the sulphide regions of the vast ore body. Anaconda was the owner of these deposits and facilities until nationalization in 1971.
</p>

<p>
Another large underground deposit, El Teniente, was acquired by the Braden Copper Company (USA) in 1904, but was later sold to the Kennecott
</p>

<p>
46
</p>

<p>
Corporation in the United States, which operated El Teniente as a subsidiary until 1971. The Rio Blanco deposits were owned by Compañia Minera Andina, a subsidiary of Cerro Corporation in New York (with interests also in Peru ...), and was still exploring the deposits at the time of its nationalization in 1971.
</p>

<p>
...
</p>

<p>
- Chilean government concerned with copper production<br>
- state became majority shareholder (51%) of the foreign-owned copper companies in the country in 1966<br>
- designed to ensure that Chilean copper was processed to the extent possible in Chile<br>
- companies accepted the "Chileanization" without too much protest as there was also more radical option of total nationalization<br>
- this happened in 1971 by the Allende government
</p>

<p>
47
</p>

<p>
- Chile's Copper Corporation became Codelco in 1971 and took immediate possession of all existing facilities<br>
- Codelco not privatized by Pinochet
</p>

<p>
48
</p>

<p>
- current smelter at Chuquicamata ("Chuqui") opened in 1953
</p>

<p>
49
</p>

<p>
- El Teniente: mining started at the beginning of the 1990s<br>
- primarily based on sulphides, all sulphide ore processed in the adjanced mill and smelter
</p>

<p>
- Potrerillos smelter and refinery; Salvador Division started operation in 1959?
</p>

<p>
- Andina Division, Rio Blanco deposit: production started in the 1970s<br>
- traditionally, a portion of the Andina concentrate was exported for smelting
</p>

<p>
50
</p>

<p>
51
</p>

<p>
- the share of electro-refined copper (from anodes produced in the smelter) declined from 60 % of total copper production in 1990 to 25 % in 2000, while share of refined copper from Sx/Ew increased from 8 % to 30 %
</p>

<br>

<p>
54
</p>

<p>
- Lagos (1989) noted 6 smelters operating in Chile; contamination through uncontrolled emissions of sulphur dioxide and particulates containing heavy metals, spillovers etc.<br>
- government in 1991 issued Decree 185, that would regulate SO2 emissions and particles from fixed sources<br>
- same or stricter standards as in US Clean Air Act
</p>

<p>
55
</p>

<p>
- the military government's environmental policy was apparently to ignore the environmental requirements as far as possible - even used as a marketing tool for foreign investors
