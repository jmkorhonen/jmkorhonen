<p>
...several analytical or explanatory models seem to touch upon something relevant concerning scientific or technological change. Yet when compared with each other, they are often framed in an either-or constellation: only one approach can be right. For example, the sociology of scientific knowledge (SSK) and actor-network theory (ANT) have been presented as models that exclude each other because of contradictory approaches to the world (Callon and Latour 1992; Collins and Yearley, 1992a, 1992b; Bloor, 1999). In other cases, different research traditions communicate poorly, or not at all.
</p>

<p>
96
</p>

<p>
Science and technology are studied by both economists and sociologistss. <br>
- but the level of interaction between two disciplines seems to be low<br>
- the relations between economic and sociological approaches are rarely discussed (exceptions: van den Belt and Rip 1997, Lemola 2000a, 2000b)<br>
- only few actors seem to have crossed the epistemic barrier (Hughes 1987, 1997), Callon (1997, 1999), Rip; see also Foray and Freeman 1993, Blomqvist and Kaijser 1998
</p>

<br>

<p>
- the paper is focused on study of technology and technological change, and in the relationships between three frameworks for understanding technological change: evolutionary economics, social construction of technology and actor-network theory
</p>

<p>
- asks whether the three perspectives could be integrated into a larger framework for understanding technological change
</p>

<p>
- frameworks chosen because they all seem to account for important aspects of technology and its change
</p>

<p>
##Evolutionary Economics
</p>

<p>
- unlikely that technological change could be explained without consideration of the economic dimension of the process<br>
97<br>
- but neoclassical economics is problematic in this context: core assumptions  <br>
- assume rational, maximizing behavior by agents with given and stable preference functions<br>
- focus on attained, or movement towards, equilibrium states<br>
- is marked by an absence of chronic information problems (see e.g. Mulhearn and Vane 1999)
</p>

<p>
- the primary interest in neoclassical economics is in understanding how markets adjust to disturbances, that is, restore equilibrium<br>
- therefore this paper uses evolutionary economics<br>
- emphasis on the cumulative and irreversible nature of economic processes, the role of institutions and organizations influencing the rate and direction of economic change, the habitual nature of economic action, the lack of perfect information in economic decision-making, the commonality of changing preference functions, and the possibility of genuine renewal through various kinds of search processes
</p>

<p>
- both neoclassical and evolutionary economics give technological change a central role in the dynamics of economies (Freeman, 1994)<br>
- but former have tended to explain technological change as a result of firms making profit-maximizing decisions on the basis of market information<br>
- evolutionary economists have looked more at the institutional framework of decision-making - A PROFOUND SHIFT<br>
- Nelson and Winter (1974, 1977) observed that companies often make decisions that do not seem to be economically rational; instead, they tend to make use of existing decision-making heuristics, e.g. SOPs and investment routines<br>
- reference to Simon's bounded rationality: real-world agents do not have perfect information about present and future markets, and their information processing capability is severely limited<br>
- therefore, routines
</p>

<p>
98
</p>

<p>
- according to Schumpeter, evolutionary economists see knowledge as a connecting link between technological change and the economic dynamics<br>
- knowledge provides innovators with a competitive advantage, but only temporarily<br>
- the concept of diffusion is therefore important; explains why, in a capitalist economy, technological change does not exhaust the incentives of firms to innovate. <br>
- because successful diffusion of new technology lowers the economic opportunities within that market, and motivates at least some firms to explore new technologies (Freeman, 1994; Rosenberg, 1999[1982])<br>
- EE considers innovations and diffusion of technology to result from learning (Freeman, 1994; Lundvall and Johnson 1994; Lundvall 1995; Rosenberg 1999[1982])<br>
- this connects the issue of technological change with Nelson and Winter's evolutionary theory of institutional change<br>
- critique against Schumpeter: focused too much on individual entrepreneurs and radical innovations<br>
- today the view is that incremental innovations are equally important for explaining the dynamics of economies, and for the most part technological change is gradual and cumulative<br>
- Dosi's technological paradigms (1982) are set in this context<br>
- in late 1980s EE approach incorporated the notion of "innovation systems:" the "institutions and economic structures affecting the rate and direction of technological change in the society" (Edquist and Lundvall, 1993:267)<br>
99<br>
- the objective of innovation systems theory is to explain why the rate and direction of technological change differ between countries or regions<br>
- system view is the newness: in evolutionary metaphor the implication is that innovating organizations are independent from the rest of the society, and in systems metaphor the interaction is emphasized<br>
- from the perspective of technology studies, innovation systems theory focuses too much on economy and too little on technology<br>
- technological change does not, as a rule, follow national and regional boundaries<br>
- for describing the systemic nature of technological change, other approaches are needed<br>
- one alternative from Freeman et al, with their notions of technological systems and techno-economic paradigms (Perez 1983; Freeman and Perez 1988; Freeman, 1995)<br>
- Freeman et al proposed that technological paradigms are formed through a process through which interdependent innovations are coupled into technological systems<br>
- these systems differ in their economic impact, because some revolutionary technologies have limited applicability while others become highly generic<br>
- the scope of a technological system is dependent, above all, on the extent to which "new markets, with high and rapid growth potential" can be created on the basis of its products (Freeman 1995:15)<br>
- some of the factors affecting developments are the capacity of new technology to reduce the costs of a large amount of products and services, its social and political acceptability, and the extent to which its technical characteristics allow a broad range of applications (Freeman 1995:15)<br>
- highly generic technological systems form techno-economic paradigms (Perez 1983) in which technological and economic development go hand in hand<br>
- EE criticized by both economists and social scientists (Lemola 2000a)<br>
100<br>
- the former complain that the concepts and hypotheses of EE are difficult to operationalize mathematically, and that it therefore fails to meet the ideal of economics as a formal science<br>
- social scientists have accused evolutionary economists of positivism, and of using poorly-defined concepts. <br>
- however, exceptions such as van den Belt and rip (1997:135) recognize the "sociological dimension" of EE and suggest that the approach could be interesting to students of technology as well<br>
- for the purposes of this paper the greates limitation of EE concerns the previously mentioned problem of the relation between innovators and the so-called selection environment. <br>
- lists of circumstances that are necessary for the formation of a paradigm or a generic system do not explain why a particular system emerged
</p>

<p>
##Social construction of technology (SCOT)
</p>

<p>
One of the things that is poorly explained by EE is why technology changes the way it does. Why does one technical solution rather than another become paradigmatic? Why not another one? <br>
- EE better at describing the outcomes of change - technological paradigms, technological trajectories, techno-economic systems - than at analysing the processes behind them<br>
- OUTCOMES rather than PROCESSES
</p>

<p>
101
</p>

<p>
SCOT proceeds from the assumption that technological change - even at the level of engineering solutions and design - is driven by social processes rather than any internal "technological logic." Proponents of this approach argue that technological criteria of functionality are of social origin. Thus, SCOT questions "naive" accounts of the success of technical artefacts, which claim that new technical artefacts are adopted because *they work better*. (Pinch and Bijker 1984:406; Bijker 1995:13-15)
</p>

<p>
From the SCOT perspective, such explanations beg the question. Why is it thought that a new artefact or material works better? What are the criteria that people use for determining functionality? A conventional answer would be that functionality is determined by the relation between the technical properties and the purpose of the artefact (what it should be used for). This presupposes that its purpose is known. However, it is precisely the purpose of artefacts that is debated in technological controversies, and purposes are determined by people and not by any non-social realm of technology. <br>
...<br>
- SCOT is more than a critique, it is also a theory of technological change<br>
- it assumes that artefacts can be interpreted in many, differing ways - they have the property of interpretative flexibility<br>
- different groups of people define relevant problems in different ways, and such differences become particularly visible in technological controversies<br>
- closure refers to the streamlining of interpretations, and consequently to the fading away of controversy<br>
102<br>
- analogue to technological paradigms and technological trajectories obvious<br>
- the concept of closure complements these terms and allows us to focus on the processes through which technological paradigms and trajectories are created, providing a remedy for some of the weaknesses of EE<br>
- technological frames: Bijker uses the term ot depict the way in which social groups interpret artefacts. He argues that the nature of technological change is dependent on the configuration of technological frames that surround the artefact etc.; the hypothesis is that the character of change is different depending on whether the sociotechnical configuration involves no, one, or several technological frames. <br>
- if no single technological frame is dominating the making of a new artefact, it should be expected that actors identify problems and suggest solutions in an unbiased way; high probability of radical inventions<br>
- if there is one clearly dominant technological frame, inventions tend to be more conventional, following the existing pattern of thinking; inputs for more radical change to be expected from people with low inclusion in the dominant frame of thinking<br>
- configurations consisting of two or more equally strong technological frames should make technological change dependent on criteria external to all technological frames<br>
- the authors believe that SCOT is an important supplement to EE by providing a terminology and a few hypotheses about closure, which can be seen as an alternative account of the emergence of a technological paradigm at a micro- or macro-level<br>
- however, SCOT does not conceptualize the socio-economic framework within which social groups are formed and technological controversies played out (Rosen, 1993). Therefore, the two approaches supplement each other<br>
103<br>
- unfortunately, SCOT lacks tools for explaining why a controversy between different relevant groups is resolved<br>
- closure is explained to happen because of redefinition of the problem the artefact is supposed to solve; other closure mechanisms rarely discussed, and in the redefinition case it could be asked whether the change in accepted functionality criteria should be considered to be an explanation or the phenomenon that needs to be explained. <br>
- the authors believe SCOT has this problem because of a deficient concept of the process of social interaction in technological controversies
</p>

<p>
##Actor-network theory
</p>

<p>
- ANT has its origin in science studies, but has diffused to other fields<br>
- origins in Callon and Latour 1981<br>
- notable debates between ANT and SSK (Callon and Latour 1992; Collins and Yearley 1992a, 1992b; de Vries 1995; Bloor 1999<br>
- one source of controversy is ANT's apparent ascription of agency to non-human and even non-living entities<br>
- nevertheless, has attracted diverse interest and is an established approach in the STS field<br>
- using ANT to overcome limitations of SCOT requires particular reading of ANT, omitting some of its philosophical and methodological foundations<br>
104<br>
- in ANT, actions should not be seen as a simple implementation of an intention, but rather as a directed construction of real-world relations. Such relations form a network: a series of interconnections that constitute action. The best way to understand the term "actor-network" is to think of it as a network constituting the agency (the capacity to act) of some actor rather than as network consisting of actors.<br>
- the network approach to action emphasizes that the latter is not dependent on just one factor, but on a chain of factors in which some links may be stronger than others<br>
- KEY ACTIVITY: TRANSLATION. Translation refers to all the negotiations, intrigues, calculations, acts of persuasion and violence, thanks to which an actor or force takes, or causes to be conferred on itself, authority to speak or act on behalf of another actor or force (Callon and Latour 1981:279)<br>
- implication: agency should be seen as a question of degree, not binary possesses/does not possess
</p>

<p>
105
</p>

<p>
- ANT approaches technology and technological change by studying the process through which a new artefact is developed. From ANT perspective, the artefact to be developed cannot be distinguished from the project particiants' attempts to translate the world according to their intentions. It is part of what is translated all along: it is ascribed a particular identity and a particular way of functioning. If technologists succeed in locking in a particular interpretation of the artefact or paradigm - that is, if they succeed in silencing the voices that quesiton that interpretation - the artefact is, in a sense, "enrolled." This is all very similar to SCOT, which talks about controversy and closure. However, at least 2 differences: <br>
- does not explain the action of the actors by reference to their social context<br>
- argues that the technological openness of the situation does not end with enrolment<br>
- ANT has no causal theory of action; it makes claims only about the constitution of action. <br>
106<br>
- Latour and Callon criticize social scientists for assuming the existence of a discrete set of social causes of action, such as rules, institutions and social groups, when in fact these are constructed in the process of action. This stance is however problematic because it neglects the possibility that society both precedes action, and is constructed through it. <br>
- attempts to translate organizational history for example to fit new identities generally meet resistance both within the actor itself and from the environment<br>
- commitments to being something - e.g. in Latour's study Renault's commitment to being Renault - are just taken for granted in Callon and Latour's analysis<br>
- SCOT and EE are quite right in proclaiming the existence of paradigmatic ways of thinking and acting, social groups and organizations with technological frames, and so on<br>
- ANT adds value in its insights into the complexity of action and interaction<br>
- successful action requires that actors attempt to lock in their identities, thinking and behavior of other actors or processes<br>
- gives valuable insight into the mechanisms of closure and the construction of technological and socio-technical paradigms as well as technological systems
</p>

<p>
107
</p>

<p>
- also explains why the institutional explanation of action is limited: we cannot assume that social groups or organizations have coherent, homogenous interests. Locked-in targets, commitments and interests are dependent on the way the group or organization is translated, by its own members and by other actors. Translation is the mechanism through which actors can transform themselves, displacing their own identity as well as that of others.
</p>

<p>
##Towards an Integrative Framework
</p>

<p>
- the integration can be summarized in four questions:
</p>

<p>
<ol type="1" start="1">
<li>What changes in technological change? i.e. what needs to change in a technological system from one state to another before we can conclude that the system has indeed changed.</li>
<li>What is the driver of such change? i.e. which human, social technological and other possibly relevant factors drive technological change.</li>
<li>What is the process of change?</li>
<li>What delimits change?</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
- drivers instead of causes, in the similar manner as climate scientists use the term: something can be the "driver" of technological change even though we cannot prove that a particular episode has been "caused" by the said driver<br>
- attribution of causality to a particular social context, organizational practice or even network would in this view be problematic
</p>

<p>
HOXNOTE: constraints can possibly act as drivers as well as causes; in the longer term, constraints act as drivers, in the short term, they may operate as causes
</p>

<p>
