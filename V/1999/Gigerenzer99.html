Bounded rationality: satisficing
</p>

<p>
“… bounded rationality is not the study of optimization in relation to task environments” (Simon 1991 p. 35)
</p>

<p>
Simon’s vision of bounded rationality has two interlocking components: the limitations of the human mind, and the structure of the environments in which the mind operates. The first component of his vision means that models of human judgment and decision making should be built on what we actually know about the mind’s capacities rather than on fictitious competencies. …
</p>

<p>
Because of the mind’s limitations, humans “must use approximate methods to handle most tasks” (Simon 1990:6). These methods include <br>
- recognition processes that largely obviate the need for further information search<br>
- heuristics that guide search and determine when it should end<br>
- simple decision rules that make use of the information found
</p>

<p>
13
</p>

<p>
The second component of Simon’s view of bounded rationality, environmental structure, is of crucial importance because it can explain when and why simple heuristics perform well: if the structure of the heuristic is adapted to that of the environment. <br>
…<br>
- classic example: foraging for food, with random food locations vs. locations where one can get cues<br>
The general point is that to understand which heuristic an organism employs, and when and why the heuristic works well, one needs to look at the structure of the information in the environment. <br>
- point made in Simon (1956a) but also made before e.g. Brunswik (1943) and after (Anderson 1990; Shepard, 1990)<br>
- the book uses term “ecological rationality” to bring environmental structure back into bounded rationality<br>
HOX HOX! Jos näin, niin silloinhan esim. työtilojen suunnittelulla on tosiaan merkitystä!
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
- satisficing: pick one possible action, play it quickly through in a mental simulation, if it works well enough (exceeds aspiration level), act it out without considering other alternatives. Otherwise, go to next alternative until a satisfactory course of action is found. See Klein (1998).
</p>

<p>
- satisficing: a way of making a decision about a set of alternatives that respects the limitations of human time and knowledge<br>
- fast and frugal heuristics: employ a minimum of time, knowledge, and computation to make adaptive choices in real environments<br>
— they can be used to solve sequential search problems, or to make choices between simultaneously available objects, where the search for information about the possible options must be limited
</p>

<p>
- satisficing and fast and frugal heuristcs are two overlapping but different categories of bounded rationality: There are some forms of satisficing that are fast and frugal, and others that are computationally unreasonable; and there are some fast and frugal heuristics that make satisficing sequential option decisions, and some that make simultaneous option choices. 
</p>

<p>
15
</p>

<p>
Standard models of optimization … assume that there is a common currency for all beliefs and desires, namely, quantitative probabilities and utilities. … When reasons cannot be converted to a single currency, the mind has little choice but to rely on a fast and frugal strategy that bases its decision on just one good reason. … however, incommensurability is not the only reason for one-reason decision making.
</p>

<p>
16
</p>

<p>
The program of studying boundedly rational heuristics involves a) designing computational models of candidate simple heuristics, b) analyzing the environmental structures in which they perform well, c) testing their performance in real-world environments, and d) determining whether and when people really use these heuristics. The results of the investigatory stages b), c), and d) can be used to inform the initial theorizing of stage a). 
</p>

<p>
HOX HOX! Käytännöllinen kontribuutio voisi olla vaihtoehtoisten heuristiikkojen kehittäminen ja testaaminen.
</p>

<p>
Computational models
</p>

<p>
A computational model of a heuristic specifies the precise steps of information gathering and processing that are involved in generating a decision, such that the heuristic can be instantiated as a computer program. For a fast and frugal heuristic, this means the computational model must specify principles for guiding a search for alternatives, information, or both, stopping that search, and making a decision.  
</p>

<p>
22
</p>

<p>
Heuristics are not simply hobbled versions of optimal strategies. There are no optimal strategies in many real-world environments in the first place. This does not mean, though, that there are no performance criteria in the real world. 
</p>

<p>
31
</p>

<p>
… We do not need to know precisely how recognition memory works to describe a heuristic that relies on recognition. This example illustrates an apparently paradoxical thesis: Higher order cognitive mechanisms can often be modeled by simpler algorithms than can lower order mechanisms. <br>
The thesis is not new. It has been proposed in various forms over the past century, as for example by proponents of the Würzburg school of psychology in the early twentieth century (Kusch, 1999) and more recently by Shepard (1967a). The thesis has limits as well, of course: Some higher order processes, such as the creative process involved in Darwin’s development of the theory of natural selection, are probably beyond the grasp of fast and frugal heuristics. But we believe that simple heuristics can be used singly and in combination to account for a great variety of higher order mental processes that may at first glance seem to require more complex explanation, as we will show throughout this book.

Chapter 7: When Do People Use Simple Heuristics, and how can we tell?<br>
Rieskamp, Jörg<br>
Hoffrage, Ulrich<br>
pages 141-
</p>

<p>
Which conditions may have an impact on strategy selection?<br>
- time pressure?
</p>

<p>
142
</p>

<p>
- two questions: does time pressure foster the use of simple heuristics, and how one can identify what strategy a person is using?
</p>

<p>
143
</p>

<p>
Principles of search direct how information is searched, principles of stopping define when search is terminated, and principles of decision specify how the information searched for is used to <br>
144<br>
make a decision. These principles can be used to characterize any specific strategy. For each of these principles, we introduce one distinction. First, a strategy can search for information in either an alternative-wise or a cue-wise manner. Alternative-wise search seeks all cue values for one alternative before the next alternative is considered, whereas cue-wise search seeks all the cue values for one cue before another cue is checked. … Second, a strategy may or may not have a stopping rule for deciding when to stop information search and to make a choice. While in many experiments the number of cues is limited, outside those experimental settings, stopping rules become essential. Third, a strategy may or may not allow for compensation. A strategy is compensatory if there is at least one cue that can be outweighed by any combination of less important cues (see chapter 6). A compensatory strategy integrates (at least some of) the available information and makes trade-offs between the relevant cues to form an overall evaluation of each alternative.

<p>
Looking at the Decision Process
</p>

<p>
- how to find out more about what kind of decision strategy:<br>
What kind of information do they seek and in what order do they collect it? More generally, what happens before the decision is made? What are the processes that lead to the final decision?<br>
… Of special interest is the order in which information is acquired by participants, how the information is cognitively represented, and how this representation is transformed to reach a decision. The investigatory methods used include asking participants to describe the process by which they arrived at their decisions, as well as monitoring the information search. <br>
The first method involves collecting verbal descriptions of the decision process - either during decision making with the “think-aloud” technique (e.g. Timmermans 1993), or retrospectively after the decision has been made.
