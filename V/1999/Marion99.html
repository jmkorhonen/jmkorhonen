An alternative explanation of complex behavior: chaos theory
</p>

<p>
In many ways, the evolution of organizational theory over the past 50years , like the evolution of physical explanation over the past 300 years, is about trying to come to terms with internal and external ambiguity, or noise. Chaos theory promises to provide new theories of noise that are useful to both physicist and social scientist. Chaos theory proposes that a certain type of noise exists in nature that is not removable by refinement of experimental procedures or by the addition of extra explanatory variables. <br>
- david ruelle called this type of noise "deterministic noise"

I propose that nearly all social activity can be metaphorically described with a strange attractor (or variation thereof), and that if proper indices can be identified, many social behaviors can be physically described with an attractor. Thisis a bold statement given the paucity of study to support it, but social Chaos Theory is, after all a developing hypothesis. <br>
...<br>
Such metaphorical comparisons don't prove, of course, that social behaviors are chaotic attractors, but, as the old saying goes, if it looks like a dog and barks like a dog, why don't we see if it will tell us something about dogs.

<p>

</p>

<p>
- class IV stability (edge of chaos; other types are period, point, and Chaotic stability, introduced in ch 2);
</p>

<p>
This area of attraction provides "enough stability to store information and enough fluidity to send signals over arbitrary distances - the two things that are essential for computation [processing information]" (Waldrop 232). In contrast, information added to point and periodic systems is frozen and unusable, while information added to Chaotic systems is lost in the static of irregular activity. 
</p>

<p>
- life processes are simultaneously stable and Chaotic<br>
...<br>
Complex system outcomes typically cannot be predetermined, yet there is a sense of the predictable about them; their dynamics don't necessarily favor efficiency; and once a stability is established, the system tends to lock in to that steady state and to exclude other possible steady states.

Complexity and Organization

</p>

<p>
Adaptive actors are in large degree guided by local interests and have limited understanding of the "big picture". Behaviors are based upon projection (however imperfect or primitive) of future outcome, these they are adaptive in a theological sense. They interact in some fashion, be it through language, hormones, or simple reaction to the presence of another. Because of the dynamics of intersection among these individuals, a system emerges. The <br>
29<br>
system is not, of necessity, deliberately created; it may, and very often does, just happen. The individuals may know that they are supposed to organize, as would be the case with human systems, and in this sense it is deliberative. However, they may not remember why or how organization first occurred or why the given organizational structure is chosen over other possible forms. <br>

Social Solitons

<p>
36
</p>

<p>
37
</p>

<p>
- social solitons add a degree of adaptability to stably dynamic solitons; they change to adjust to their environments, respond to contingencies <br>
- social solitons tend to be products of symbolic rather than physical communication<br>
- communication controlled in that each attractor has access only to limited number of other attractors<br>
- consequently the internal structure of social system is typically far more ordered Ghana that of physical systems

<p>
Pervasive Problems: Order, Randomness, and Causality
</p>

<p>
- before the Enlightenment, people commonly attributed outcome to need; horses had tails so that they could swat flies<br>
- government existed because human nature is selfish and people must be protected against their own brutishness (the Hobbesonian perspective) <span class="zim-tag">@politics</span> <span class="zim-tag">@politicalscience</span> <span class="zim-tag">@philosophy</span><br>
- this is teleology
</p>

<p>
- Newton’s articulations regarding causality pervade today not only our understandings of scientific phenomena but dominate the way we think about nearly everything; event A causes event B, and event B is proportionally related to event A <span class="zim-tag">@perception</span>
</p>

<p>
The questions we ask as a culture, whether scientific or offhand, reflect some variation of these themes. They betray an assumption that events can be linearly attributed to simple causes. … “What drives people to riot?” implies a simple cause of social disorder. 
</p>

<p>
41
</p>

<p>
- we don’t need nonlinear theory to teach that social events result from complex interactions among a number of variables<br>
- loose coupling theorist Karl Weick, for example, is rather pointed about circular causality and multiple interactions<br>
- however, nonlinear theory is necessary to understand how dramatic this break is from the Newtonian logic<br>
- circular causation means that order must be understood as the product of such interaction rather than the product of simple causality<br>
- not only are traditional causal paths disrupted, but the very notion that every event has its predictable cause or causes is broken as well. - “God does not play dice” - yes he does!<br>
- God cannot be banished from the gaps, for the gaps are axiomatic in nature
</p>

<p>
42
</p>

<p>
- Newton identified the point attractor and the periodic attractor; their existence has blinded us to alternative perspectives of stability<br>
- nonlinear theory teaches that randomness and unpredictability are givens, abd that they can build order, albeit a rather complex one<br>
Social stability exists; it is dynamic and somewhat disordered, but there needn’t be an either/or perspective of order<br>
- finally, traditional Newtonian assumes that causality is time independent
</p>

<p>
The First of Newton’s Legacies: Social Physics
</p>

<p>
- social physics was perhaps the earliest non-philosophical theory of organization and society<br>
- social physics compares society to a machine with its complex of different but interdependent parts<br>
- the parts of such systems are held together by attraction and repulsion<br>
- concepts such as social space, centrifugal forces, attraction and attractors, countervailing pressures, social equilibrium<br>
- two ideas introduced to organizational theory by social physices:<br>
- directly: equilibrium<br>
43<br>
- by implication: organizations are composed of units linked in a causal chain<br>
- this would give brittle systems, like computer programs!
</p>

<p>
- social equilibrium is a troublesome concept for organizational theorists: one observer can see persistence, while another can see constant flux<br>
- since Newton’s model of stability does not help us with this contradiction, social scientists have had to choose between an unstable (change) perspective and stability perspective<br>
- adaptive systems are globally stable yet locally nonrepetitive, i.e. both changing and stable
</p>

<p>
44
</p>

<p>
Stability needn’t exist at the expense of change, and vice versa
</p>

<p>
Kant and Teleology
</p>

<p>
- Rational Morphologists: believed that biological structures are perfectly suited for their appointed tasks and there are logical patterns to structure. Organisms are variations on a few universal mechanisms. Similarities between organisms are due to same basic underlying principles.
</p>

<p>
45
</p>

<p>
- For Kant, organisms were fundamentally self-reproducing, and therefore self-organizing wholes. In an organism, parts exist both for one another and by means of one another. Thus, biological structure is a function of interactions between “parts.” This self-generating dynamic is Complexity theory almost 200 years ago.
</p>

<p>
Complexity and Structure
</p>

<p>
- Darwin contradicted Rational Morphologists by hypothesizing that common structure is the result of common ancestry and selectin<br>
- D’Arcy Thompson (On Growth and Form) disagreed somewhat
</p>

<p>
46
</p>

<p>
- Structural similarity needs not be attributed to common ancestry; similarities can also be the simple result of physics<br>
- these arguments bear significance for organizational theory as well!<br>
“Inherent necessity” and self-organization challenge, for example, the close relationship that many theorists believe to exist between environmental pressure and organizational structure. Structural Contingency Theory, which is founded in the seminal work of James March and Herbert Simon, makes the underlying assumption that “a firm’s efficiency is dependent on the relation between the state of the environment and the form of the organization (Grandori, 1987, p. 1). Population Ecologists argue that, “Organizations exist in environments and are responsive to environmental forces” (McKelvey, 1982, p. 242), and “natural selection will turn out to be the best way to explain the relation of organizations to their environments” (p. 243; Population Ecology is a set of organizational theories based on the evolutionary principles of biology). The Kantian view, particularly in its more modern expressions, does not dispute that evolution is a force acting on structure, but suggests that many elements of structure may be better explained by physical forces, or, as Kauffman argues, that structure is an interactive product of physical forces (particularly Complexity dynamics) and natural selection. One might argue, for example, that standard organizational forms (such as organizational departmentalization or hierarchical structuring) are as much or more products of the demands of inevitable necessity as they are products of common ancestry.
</p>

<p>
47
</p>

<p>
. a speciality in Org Theory called Systematics is concerned with categorizing social organizations in the same manner that biology is organized into phyla and species. <span class="zim-tag">@systematics</span><br>
- two broad perspectives can be identified: <br>
- classification based on evolutionary lineages, or family trees<br>
- looking solely at current structural parallels regardless of lineage<br>
- a common assumption among theorists is that both approaches will lead to similar conclusions but that ancestry will be the better predictor of structure<br>
- McKelvey has observed that there are many similarities among organizations that cannot be explained by common ancestry<br>
- neither Thompson nor Chaos and Complexity theorists would argue that selection is unimportant, rather they point us to additional explanations of structure and behavior and life.
</p>

<p>
Teleology
</p>

<p>
- Rational morphology and Darwinian logic have different perspectives on causation:<br>
- Teleological causation<br>
- efficient causation<br>
- Darwinian “survival of the fittest” is something of an amalgam of these opposites
</p>

<p>
48
</p>

<p>
- Complexity theorists see causation from all three perspectives_<br>
- Kantian perspective of efficient causation<br>
- Darwinian ambivalence<br>
- purposeful and teleological behaviors (principally in human systems)<br>
…<br>
So just what is the role of teleology within the grand scheme of human and social evolution? Do humans control their present and their future, do they anticipate and mold that which is needed for survival, or do they mold what they think is needed in the hope that Darwin’s whimsical gods will find favor with their work? …<br>
49<br>
…ultimately we will conclude that life a complex dance involving teleological control, efficient causation, and Darwinian shifting.
</p>

<p>
Darwin, Spencer, Social Darwinism
</p>

<p>
- although Darwin recognized that the process of structural elaboration is not entirely random (i.e. microscopic path dependency), the overall effect is one of accident - “history is just one damn thing after another”<br>
- Gradual or punctuated evolution? Both approaches pose problems<br>
50<br>
- one response to the punctuated equilibrium dilemma is that unchanging phenotypes are the result of stable environments
</p>

<p>
Social Darwinism
</p>

<p>
- Herbert Spencer adopted Darwin’s theories for social explanation, and coined the phrase “survival of the fittest”<br>
Two different perspectives on social evolution can be identified in Spencer’s writing.<br>
- the “organismic” model, or the assertion that parts of social organization are like the interdependent organs of a biological organism, cooperating for their mutual benefit and support<br>
- the “organic” model, where social events compare to inter-species competition, and is more in tune with Darwin’s natural selection models than is the cooperative argument<br>
- Spencer favoured the latter “survival explanation of sociology,” warning against incautious use of the organismic model<br>
- these models lead to dramatically different conclusions about organization<br>
- organismic model sees society as consensual and mutually dependent; metaphors not unlike those presented by mechanistic models of Social Physicists &amp; social equilibrium etc. Include Weber’s Theory of Bureaucracy, Taylor’s Scientific Management, Parson’s Structural Functionalism<br>
- organic model is a competition model; leads to conclusions about variety, divergence, and conflict in society and organization. Legacy can be seen in Dahrendorf’s Social Conflict Model, Population Ecology, and the Process Model of the Chigaco School.
</p>

<p>
Competition or Cooperation
</p>

<p>
51
</p>

<p>
- is society conflictive or cooperative?<br>
- organic model probablt more widely adopted than organismic model<br>
- Organizational structure commonly interpreted in terms of power and struggle over scarce resources (see e.g. Bauer &amp; Cohen 1983; Francis 1983; Hannan &amp; Freeman 1977; Perrow 1981; Pfeffer &amp; Salancik 1978)<br>
- Buckley’s important text on Social Systems Theory rejected consensus/equilibrium models of organization, however was influenced by misunderstanding about the nature of stability (only periodic &amp; repetitive; not Chaotic stability)
</p>

<p>
- Complexity Theory does not deny conflict and competition, but does argue that fitness is better described and served by cooperation<br>
- in the biological context, the phrase “survival of the fittest” might have to be replaced by “emergence of the cooperative”
</p>

<p>
52
</p>

<p>
- Kauffman found that a dynamic equilibrium emerges where each species is optimally fit at a level that does not disrupt the fitness of other organisms in the network<br>
- cooperation is important to social structure as well<br>
- Goodwin (180-81): “The immensely complex network of relationships among organisms involves all imaginable patterns of interaction, and there is absolutely no point in focusing on competitive interactions, singling them out as the driving point in evolution.”<br>
- Cooperation as a far more powerful metaphor to explain social fitness than the fierce competition of Spencer’s organic world<br>
Two questions demand our attention at this point. First, if cooperation rather than “survival of the fittest” is the better metaphor for social fitness, then what provides motivation for elaboration and improvement? Second, one can hardly ignore the reality of conflict in social dynamics, so where does it fit in a collaboration model?<br>
- second: a football game is competitive, but it depends on a considerable amount of cooperation; Cold War brought stability to the world
</p>

<p>
55
</p>

<p>
The distinciton between cooperation and competitive cooperation is blurred, both in definition and in effect. I argue, therefore, that much of what is called conflictive has the ultimate effect of creating the type of cooperation that Kauffman labeled dynamic equilibrium. Competition is part and parcel of cooperation.
</p>

<p>
- First: what provides the motivation for improvement? To start with, systems can succeed of fail for reasons not related to competition. Reasons why firms succeed or fail have often little to do with slection and competition. Fitness accrues to those who are best able to garner resources and that ability goes to organizations that can create mutually supportive networks with other systems; it does not accrue to those whose sole goal is to serve self at the expense of others. The motivation to elaborate, then, could be as simple as survival, and cooperation is the best tool for achieving it.
</p>

<p>
Structural Functionalism and Homeostasis
</p>

<p>
- Parsons (from Structural Functionalist movement) argued convincingly for a stability perspective of society; social groups are interrelated in stable and predictable patterns; these relationships represent order<br>
- Social needs (teleology) is a cornerstone of Structural Functionalism<br>
Parsons argued that peole and organizations cooperatively produce needed social structures thatn, under<br>
56<br>
optimal conditions, function cooperatively for the common good. Society possesses given structures, then, because it needs them.<br>
- critique: causality results from a mixture of purposiveness and accident<br>
- since future cannot control the present, in critic’s view, causality must be efficient; purposiveness serves the same role as accident in the relentless march of efficient causation<br>
- both positions correct in some measure, difference more a matter of perspective than substance<br>
- Parsons is unclear about just what he meant by stability; dynamic concept that can flex and grow, or Spencerian organismic equilibrium model?<br>
- adopted the term “homeostatic” to describe more flexible-than-equilibrium situation
</p>

<p>
57<br>
- a problem: homeostasis implies deviancy, which implies normative statements about what is good about a society
</p>

<p>
Complex Homeostasis
</p>

<p>
- Ashby’s work defined homeostasis somewhat more workable than Parson’s: an “autopilot” that may have multiple “survivable” combinations of controls; parameter space divided to a number of relatively stable regions that are separated by bifurcation walls
</p>

<p>
58
</p>

<p>
Parameter space, and the attractors defined by it, have several characteristics that are important to our definition of homeostasis. First is the fact that many regions of parameter space are fairly large and systems can wander within them without experiencing significant change … Homeostasis for our purposes, then, is not a fixed state; rather it drifts over a range of values without compromising the systems within it. Alternatively, one could say that homeostasis can be perturbed without causing dramatic change in the state of the system it represents.<br>
Second, parameter space defines a set of sttractors (see Figure 2.3). These attractors expand and contract as they drift through a given region of parameter space, and they change dramatically when they cross a bifurcation wall into a new region of parameter space. Different areas of a single region, however, produce self-similar attractors. Homeostasis in organization and society is represented as just such a stable attractor; like attractors, homeostasis gradually changes as it drifts through a region of parameter space. Homeostasis is dynamic and changing, but different states can easily be identified as being from the same “family.”<br>
Third, parameter space is divided into regions, each of which contains different forms of attractors. … If an attractor moves out of a given region of parameter space, the system it represents destabilizes until it can find a new region that will again maintain the structure within survivable parameters. …<br>
Fourth, the size of homeostatic attractors that defines a given dynamic can vary but should be appropriate to the needs of the system. An attractor that fluctuates over too large a range of values is attempting to encompass too wide a range of activities. Such activities should be divided up and allocated to different attractors.<br>
59<br>
Complexity Theory provides mechanisms for these different attractors to interact in a manner that contributes to the success of the broader system…<br>
Fifth, the region of parameter space occupied by a system’s attractor should be small enough to allow exploration of other parameter regions if needed but not so small that bifurcation walls are crossed too readily. A large region of parameter space may force a system to cover too large a range of values before a bifurcation wall is crossed, making it difficult to find new regions. … too small, the system could cross a bifurcation wall with small parameter changes, making the region too unstable for most social dynamics. …<br>
Sixth, and finally, the dimensionality of attractors should be balanced against the capabilities of the system to maintain homeostatic stability. If an attractor must juggle too many variables, a viable attractor may be difficult to find or may even be nonexistent. … Put simply, there is a limit to the number of parameters that a system can juggle and still find homeostasis.
</p>

<p>
Definition of homeostasis:<br>
<ol type="1" start="1">
<li>Social homeostasis refers to behavior that drifts over a range of parameters, but the various states of the system are self-similar; that is, the system is dynamically stable. By extension, homeostatic behavior is never repetitive, but neither is it unchanging.</li>
<li>Homeostasis maintains a certain set of variables within specific value ranges required for survival and reproduction of the systems it represents.</li>
<li>On occasion, certain factors may trigger dramatic (discontinous) reformulation of homeostasis; in such cases the system may search for different patterns of behavior that serve its survival needs (new homeostasis) or it may find its way back to the initial homeostatic attractor.</li>
<li>Homeostatic attractors are relatively small; that is, they encompass a limited range of behaviors. Various attractors interact with one another to produce more complex behavior.</li>
<li>The range of parameters over which homeostasis ranges is sufficiently large to avoid frequent dramatic change but sufficiently small to permit the system to find a bifurcation wall if needed.</li>
</ol>
60<br>
<ol type="1" start="6">
<li>The number of parameters simultaneously controlled by stable social systems is balanced against the ability of the system to find or achieve viable stability relative to those variables; that is, the homeostatic attractor is relatively focused in what it attempts to do. </li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
- the definition advocates a view of stability that is neither predictable or repetitive, nor unpredictable and constant change<br>
- this homeostasis is not stable because of usual reasons regarding change or lack thereof; it’s stable because system’s actions, while unpredictable and never repetitive, are nonetheless confined to a certain range of relatively self-similar activities, and because its behaviors are not easily deflected from homeostasis.<br>
- this definition allows for change and dramatic change<br>
- change is a function of many factors: environmental pressure, random behavioral fluctuations, mental teleology, normal &amp; dynamical behavior
</p>

<p>
61
</p>

<p>
- it’s easy to say that control is one-way, from environmental parameters to system: <br>
… However, the system can do more than just search, it can influence the environment for its (the systems) own well-being. A system … exerts some measure of control over [its] environment.

Chapter 5: A Nonlinear Redaction of Open Systems
</p>

<p>
The organizational theories of the last half of the 20th century are, in one fashion or another, variations of Open Systems Theory.<br>
- it became popular in the 1960s<br>
- made then-revolutionary statement that organizational structure and behavior are heavily influenced by environmental factors<br>
- previous theories had told that leaders made the difference, that organizations were rational products<br>
- Machine Theory and human relations theory were closed theories, assuming that everything of importance to the structure and success of an organization lay within its walls<br>
- Systems Theory, by contrast, speaks of open structures: internal activities are more the products of external than internal factors
</p>

<p>
64
</p>

<p>
- Open systems can be defined as holistic, interactive, and cybernetic. Each of these characteristics will be developed in the following sections
