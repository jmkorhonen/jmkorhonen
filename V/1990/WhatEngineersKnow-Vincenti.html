<p>
Major categories of engineering design knowledge \citep[p. 208]{Vincenti1990}
</p>

<p>
<ol type="1" start="1">
<li>Fundamental design concepts 2. Criteria and specifications 3. Theoretical tools 4. Quantitative data 5. Practical considerations 6. Design instrumentalities</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
...
</p>

<p>
Designers setting out on any normal design bring with them fundamental concepts about the device in question. These concepts may exist only implicitly in the back of the designer's mind, but they must be there. They are givens for the project, even if unstated. They are absorbed - by osmosis, so to speak - by engineers in the course of growing up, perhaps even before entering formal engineering training. They had to be learned deliberately by the engineering community at some time, however, and form an essential part of design knowledge." \citep[p. 208]{Vincenti1990}
</p>

<p>
Designers must know first of all what Michael Polanyi calls the *operational principle* of their device. By this one means, in Polanyi's words, "how its characteristic parts..." fulfill their special function in combining to an overall operation which achieves the purpose" of the device - in brief, how the device works. \citep[p. 208]{Vincenti1990} (note 9)
</p>

<p>
- example: Sir George Cayley stated the operational principle of a fixed-wing aircraft ("airplane") in 1809 as
</p>

<p>
"to make a surface support a given weight by the application of power to the resistance of air." (note 10)
</p>

<p>
209
</p>

<p>
As elaborated by Polanyi, it is the operational principle that provides the criterion by which success or failure is judged in the purely technical sense. If a device works according to its operational principle, it is counted as being a success; if something breaks or otherwise goes wrong so that the operational principle is not achieved, the device is a failure. The operational principle alson, in effect, defines a device. The members of a group of vehicles all qualify, for example, as airplanes - as against, say, helicopters - which obtain their lift from rotors - only if they share the operational principle laid down by Cayley. (A device is thus defined by its technical nature, not its economic or other use.)
</p>

<p>
Finally, the operational principle provides an important point of difference between technology and science - it originates outside the body of scientific knowledge and comes into being to serve some innately technological purpose. The laws of physics may be used to analyze such things as airfoils, propellers, and rivets once their operational principle has been devised, and they may even help in devising it; they in no way, however, contain or by themselves imply the principle. Polanyi makes essentially the same point a bit differently: "The physiochemical topography of the object may in some cases serve as a clue to its technical interpretation, but by itself it would leave us completely in the dark [about how it achieves its operational purpose].... *The complete* [i.e. scientific] *knowledge of a machine as an object tells us nothing about it as a machine." (note 11)
</p>

<p>
A second thing the practitioner of normal design takes for granted is the *normal configuration* for the device. By this I mean the general shape and arrangement that are commonly agreed to best embody the operational principle. Such qualitative restriction, though not definitive in the same manner as the operational principle, plays a strongly determining role. ...
</p>

<p>
210
</p>

<p>
...
</p>

<p>
A shared operational principle and normal configuration define the normal technology (or design) of a device in the sense used by Constant as mentioned in chapter 1, that is, as denoting "the improvement of the accepted tradition or its application under "new or more stringent conditions." ... Radical technology (as I used that term in chapter 1) involves a change in normal configuration and possibly also in operational principle. In the latter event, the configuration must in fact be established ab initio, since it obviously cannot be known at the outset. When this happens, the resulting technology may even justifiably be described as revolutionary in its early stages. It was in this sense that Constant titled his book *The Origins of the Turbojet Revolution.* ... Radical and even revolutionary technology may occur at the level of an overall device, as happened in Constant's instance, or at the level of a subsidiary component, as with Jacobs's idea about how pressure distribution can advantageously operate to reduce airfoil drag. Radical developments that fall short of revolutionary may involve a modification of operational principles, in contrast to complete change. The distinctions here are relative and not always easily defined. ...
</p>

<p>
Every device possesses an operational principle, and, once the device has become an object of normal, everyday design, a normal configuration. Engineers doing normal design bring these concepts to their task usually without thinking about them. ...
</p>

<p>
211
</p>

<p>
The operational principle and normal configuration provide a framework within which normal design takes place. To translate these concepts into a concrete design requires knowledge from the categories that follow. ...
</p>

<p>
<ol type="1" start="2">
<li>Criteria and specifications. To design a device embodying a given operational principle and normal configuration, the designer must have at some point specific requirements in terms of the hardware. That is to say, someone - the designer or somebody else - must translate the general, qualitative goals for the device into specific, quantitative goals couched in concrete technical terms. ...</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
To accomplish such tasks, the people responsible must have knowledge of technical criteria appropriate to the device and its use (in earlier terminology the design problem must be "well defined") and must assign some kind of numerical values or limits to those criteria. Without such technical specifications, the designer cannot start to contrive the details and dimensions that must ultimately be supplied to the builder (note 13). Assignment of the values or limits is usually (but not always ...) particular to particular designs and is best looked upon as part of the design process. The criteria themselves - the essential key to engineering specification - constitute an important element of general engineering knowledge. ...
</p>

<p>
212
</p>

<p>
...
</p>

<p>
Assignment of values or limits to appropriate criteria is essential for design. For an overall device like the bridge or DC-4E mentioned earlier, such assignment takes place at the project-definition level in the design hierarchy described in chapter 1. People functioning at this level produce the technical specifications required for the concrete design activity that follows. At the levels of detailed design, designers themselves set requirements for the subsidiary components.
</p>

<p>
...
</p>

<p>
When circumstances are sufficiently general, specification of values or limits can apply across an entire technology. - e.g standards
</p>

<p>
Translation of the utilitarian, usually qualitative, goals of a device into concrete technical terms - and the knowledge required to do so - are crucial for engineering design. They deserve more attention than 213 they have received from historians and philosophers of technology. Determining the essential criteria often draws on the theoretical tools, quantitative data, and pragmatic judgment discussed in the remaining categories.
