Abstract:
</p>

<p>
In the mid 1850s, when it was presented to the general public for the first time, the promoters of aluminium introduced it as the metal of the scientific age. This classification was the beginning of countless statements linking its symbolic meaning to the most prestigious achievements of the modern age and thus to the ideology of progress.
</p>

<p>
In fact, most of the promises turned out to be exaggerations or fiction. Aluminium was a delicate material compared to traditional alloys. During the first Great War, it became a strategic metal replacing scarce metals in the German armaments industries but, owing ot disappointing experiences during the war, it acquired the unpleasant favor of an 'ersatz'. On the other hand, it had its breakthroughs, as for example in the manufacture of pistons for cylinders.
</p>

<p>
This article sets out examples of how the introduction and application of the new metal was woven into an ideological and technological complex which appears to us as the history of aluminium.
</p>

<p>
"The stone, the bronze, the iron and steel ages have each had their turn; indications now point to the next being an age for aluminium and its alloys." - T.D. West, 1886
</p>

<p>
More than 20 years ago, Marie Boas Hall depicted as a 'central fact of the history of ... aluminium: in spite of technical difficulties and disappointments', that it was able to fascinate people and survive over 50 years of struggle. And even after the breakthrough in production technology and thus a drastic reduction in price in the 1890s, it would not find wide application as rapidly as its protagonists had anticipated. Therefore, she came up with the title: 'The Strange Case ...' which is a perfect formulation for the history of aluminium
</p>

<p>
182
</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li>Schatzberg: the "progress ideology of metal"
<ul>
<li>"Wood symbolized preindustrial technologies and craft traditions while metal represented the industrial age, technical progress, and the primacy of science"</li>
<li>the idea of metal instead of wooden construction even grew to become an ideological constraint on politicians, entrepreneurs, engineers, and scientists.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>however, more precise expression would be that aluminium became part of the "ideological notion of progress carried by the scientific metal" (6)</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Additionally, this interpretation is reinforced by the fact that in utopian writings up to 1900, electricity, high-speed trains, and 'very lightweight metals' were 'the most commonly mentioned scientific marvels of the future'. (7)
</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li>Robert Friedel has applied the term 'ideology of novelty' to the history of materials in the era of industrialization</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
This ideology was part of the modern view which saw 'the development and adaptation of new materials as an ordinary and expected aspect of technological progress'. (7)
</p>

<p>
The striking argument of these studies in relation to my subject is that along with technological and economic considerations, other obviously 'non-rational' factors influence the preference for and choice of a certain material. In Wengenroth's study (3) it is the chauvinistic striving for national prestige as well as for economic and political power. In Schatzberg's work it is the belief in a certain material which was not justified by its technological performance. My extension of Schatzberg's term shows the impact of the belief in the scientific age, which at its extreme had an<br>
183<br>
almost religious intensity. And, for Friedel, it is the 'perceptual change' in relation to materials, in which novelty became the 'familiar mode'. Such factors, having a significant impact on design concepts or styles, exist beyond strict scientific rules or construction requirements. Rather, as Hughie Mackay and Gareth Gillespie put it, 'ideology is central to functioning and symbolic encoding' for the process 'of the appropriation of technologies by users' (9). And this is why, in materials history also, we have to take into account cultural, social, economic, and political states of minds in the interpretation of technological change.
</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li>aluminium as "silver from clay"</li>
<li>for Deville, the discovery of aluminium was a "conquest of science"</li>
<li>the message of this wonder metal was disseminated to the general public</li>
<li>in 1856 the popular Household Words, a Victorian journal edited by none other than Charles Dickens, reported on aluminium (17)</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Its interest arose from the unsatisfying performance of common metals in use in the household, such as copper, silver, and the alloy German-silver (18). All were expensive, and tarnished quickly in service. In this year, as the journal reported, aluminium 'had become cheaper than silver ... and tea and coffee pots, spoons, &amp;c.' were available in the shops of jewellers. (19) For Household Words it was clear that insofar as 'all substitute-silvers [were] humbugs and changelings', aluminium would 'send tin to the right-about face, drive copper saucepans into penal servitude, and blow up German-silver skyhigh into nothing. Henceforward, respectable babies would be born with aluminium spoons in their mouths.'
</p>

<p>
185
</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li>there was also a get-rich-quick fuss around aluminium:</li>
</ul>
The metal was extracted from alumina, the oxide of which was also a component of simple clay. Since aluminium was sold for a very high price, a person living on a heavy clay farm could believe 'that he was the possessor of untold wealth, for nearly the whole of his property could be converted into aluminium, and sold at an enormous profit'.
</p>

<p>
==Aluminium, a mortifying disappointment
</p>

<p>
More nonsense than enough has been talked about aluminium and its capabilities. From its earliest appearance on a semi-commercial scale under the patronage of Napoleon III with the eminently absurd title of 'Silver from Clay', up to the present instant, when the most surprising mixtures for its manufacture are daily patented, it has served as the catchword and stalking-horse of the ignorant enthusiastic and the knavish empiric. Its wide diffusion, difficult extractibility, and remarkable properties seem to have appealed especially to that class of persons whose imaginative powers are largely in excess of their intellectual faculties, and, characteristically enough, rushing in where angels fear to tread, they have been guilty of the wildest extravagances. - Anon., 1891 (23)
</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li>it seems a major part of myth of aluminium was dismantled in workshops and foundries that first used aluminium: "The number of published complaits during the first ten years was abundant."</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Already in 1856 it became clear that the metal 'which so much fuss has been made [of, would] not appear by any means likely to answer the expectations of its inventor' (24)
</p>

<p>
186
</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li>impurities made aluminium extremely brittle</li>
<li>color was dull</li>
<li>in 1867, after more than 10 years of experience with the metal, it was obvious that</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
After a short time it was perceived that the brilliant anticipations formed ... were doomed to suffer a mortifying disappointment: that qualities had been bestowed upon it which it did not in reality possess, and that those which truly belonged to it had been considerably exaggerated. ... (28)
</p>

<p>
With these statements, *The Engineer* interrupted its reports on aluminium for more than 15 years. The term 'aluminium' simply disappeared from the subject index. For the engineering mainstream, the metal had fallen into insignificance.
</p>

<p>
In 1878, the light metal was again presented at the Paris World Exhibition. Now, the aluminium industry had readhed an age of more than 20 years, and the metal's quality had been altered significantly. But still the industry had not boomed as had been prophesied. Its products were still bijouterie, tableware and binoculars. It had not made its way into the metal-working industries, and contemporaries reported that together with its high price, a major obstacle was its strange processing techniques. Also, 'nobody [knew] how to cast it.' (29)
</p>

<p>
==Production breakthrough and workshop trouble
</p>

<p>
"The age of steam is giving way to the age of electricity; shall we say the age of aluminium is superseding the age of steel?" - Anon, 1901 (30)
</p>

<p>
188
</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li>aluminium became a part of powerful symbol of the modern and scientific age: aeronautics</li>
<li>in 1896, Graf Zeppelin announced he had chosen aluminium wrought alloy for his airship</li>
<li>aluminium proponents believed ships would be made of aluminium, but navies and shipbuilders assessed its corrodability as a show stopper</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
189
</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li>traditional methods for scouring greasy pans, byu boiling them with soda, had to be avoided because aluminium would dissolve together with the grease</li>
<li>aluminium vessels put on a greasy, unappetizing layer</li>
<li>on the shop floor, aluminium's delicate technological character became obvious</li>
<li>for instance, none of the solders was able to produce reliable joints</li>
<li>not having cheap and reliable jointing techniques restricted the metal's use significantly</li>
<li>finding a suitable solder for aluminium was open to wild experimentation, since the lucky inventor would probably gain immense profit</li>
<li>in 1921, the perfect aluminium solder was still considered an object of desire, its search even ranking with the 'search for the philosopher's stone' (49)</li>
<li>in the same year, the German 'Gesellschaft für Metallkunde' even offered 20,000 Reichsmark as a prize for that solder which would result in perfect joints in the most simple and reliable way</li>
</ul>
<div style='padding-left: 30pt'>
- little success though
</div>
<ul>
<li>auto industry started the maturation of aluminium, by casting light metal crankcases and other auto parts from 1898 onwards</li>
<li>in the early 1920s, about 20% of US domestic aluminium output was consumed in the automotive industry for crankcases, oil pans, pistons, housings, manifolds, bodies and many small parts (52)</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
191
</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li>German wartime production and use of aluminium tainted the metal with the flavor of 'ersatz' poor quality substitute</li>
<li>poor quality aluminium, produced by inexperienced and unskilled personnel using dirty pitch coke anodes for electrolysis (instead of cleaner American petrol coke) resulted to poor reputation</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
192
</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li>Nazis tried to replace even the word 'ersatz' because of its connotations, by "Heimstoffe"</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
196
</p>

<p>
==Conclusion
</p>

<p>
[The preference of a material] appears to depend less on the objective qualities of ... two [competing] materials than on the ingenuity and prestige of the architects and engineers committed to the one material or the other and on the competitiveness and marketing flair of the producers in the two industries. - W.O. Alexander, 1967 (102)
</p>

<p>
Up to the 1930s, aluminium acuired quite different reputations. Scientists, entrepreneurs and engineers, but also household users and foundry and workshop practicioners, contributed to the symbolic meanings of the new metal. But first and foremost, it was Deville himself who generated the myth of the scientific metal and attached it to "his" light metal. He and other promoters produced an endless flow of exaggerations of the new material's qualities and future applications. In everyday life, these stood in contradiction to experience characterized by numerous and costly disappointments. As the examples given in this article reveal, the change to aluminium metallurgy and technology was a question of beliefs and prejudices, as well as of empirical experience, with<br>
197<br>
techno-scientific research and development interacting with this ideological complex. Even hard-baked metallurgists such as the distinguished W.O. Alexander had to admit that the choice of materials was as much a question of personal commitment and marketing flair as of objective characteristics. Thus, in order to get a fine grained analysis of aluminium history, it is necessary to go beyond 'objective' technological and economic numnbers, and to track down the interactions of its ideolpogical complex with specific metallurgical and technological changes in the production and application of aluminium.
