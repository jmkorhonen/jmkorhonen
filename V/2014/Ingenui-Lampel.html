<p>
- this is the introduction paper to the special issue exploring the main features of "organizational ingenuity," defined as "the ability to <s>create</s> innovative solutions within structural constraints using limited resources and imaginative problem solving." 
</p>

<p>
- looks at the changing views of the importance of ingenuity for economic and social development<br>
- next analyzes the nature of ingenious solutions<br>
- followed by a discussion of structural, resource and temporal constraints that face problem solvers<br>
- creative problem solving under constraints<br>
- contrasts "induced" and "autonomous" problem solving; the first arises when external stakeholders or top managers impose tasks that define problems for the individuals and groups that must solve them; the second arises when these individuals and groups recognize and define the problems for themselves. <br>
- argues that in both induced and autonomous problem solving, individuals and groups that wish to act creatively confront two types of constraint<br>
- first: "product constraints" that define the features and functionalities that are necessary for a successful solution<br>
- second: "process constraints" that stand in the way of creative problem solving in a given organizational context<br>
- argue that both types of constraints can lead to organizational ingenuity, but dealing with process constraints is crucial for organizational ingenuity, and hence for sustaining organizational ingenuity more generally
</p>

<p>
466
</p>

<p>
- the terms "creativity" and "innovation" encompass large conceptual and empirical domains<br>
- the term "ingenuity" was selected to focus on creative problem solving within institutional constraints
</p>

<p>
- Oxford dictionary definition of "ingenuity:" "quality of being clever, original, and inventive." <br>
- Merriam-Webster dictionary even more specific, defining "ingenuity" as "skill or cleverness that allows someone to solve problems, invent things." 
</p>

<p>
Both of these definitions, however, emphasize ingenuity as the property of individual actors, reinforcing the contrast that is often made in the research literature (not to mention popular discussion) between creativity and its absence: on the one hand we have romantic images of entrepreneurs asserting the primacy of creativity by breaking rules and transcending boundaries, and on the other institutionalized managers constrained by rules and prevented by boundaries from exercising creativity (Lampel, Honig, and Drori 2014). 
</p>

<p>
Equating ingenuity with gifted individuals who operate outside, or even struggle against, established organizations is part of the ethos of rugged individualism that was prevalent in early capitalism, especially in the United Staes. In the early days of the American republic, ingenuity, or more specifically "Yankee ingenuity", was seen as the main advantage of American industry in a world where European powers with superior resources clearly dominated the economic landscape. Alexander Hamilton, one of the founding fathers, believed that Americans had a special "genius" for invention, a genius that showed in their "peculiar aptitude for mechanical improvement (Fisk, 2009, p. 20.) Eighteenth century, and early nineteenth century, authors, such as Benjamin Rumford (1814) (memorialized later in a prestigious American scientific prize) and John Melish (1812) who influenced Thomas Jefferson (Peterson, 1970), went further back in time to argue that ingenuity can be seen in its purest form in pre-industrial societies precisely because resources are so scarce, and necessity is so immediate. It followed from this that American ingenuity flourished in the new world not only because of pressing needs and scarce financial and human resources, but also because this newly created society had avoided the institutional constraints that shaped innovation in Europe. 
</p>

<p>
By the middle of the twentieth century the pendulum had swung against seeing ingenuity as the mainstay of technological change and economic development. Government funding of technological innovation, and the rise of corporate research and development, led many to argue that organized research and development was demonstrably superior to ingenuity which depends on hunches and inspiration, and hence is hard to predict and control. John Kenneth Galbraith (1967, p. 75) sums up this view in the cleares way when he writes that:
</p>

<p>
467
</p>

<p>
"The real accomplishment of modern science and technology consists in taking quite ordinary men, informing them narrowly and deeply and then, through appropriate organization, arranging to have their knowledge combined with that of other specialized but equally ordinary men. This dispenses with the need for genius. The resulting performance, though less inspiring, is far more predictable." 
</p>

<p>
This special issue argues that writers such as Galbraith who saw ingenuity as unnecessary in the age of organized research and development failed to differentiate between routine and creative problem solving. The former does useful work in a myriad of situations, but the latter is essential for economic and social renewal (Greve, 2003; Schumpeter, 1934). We have ample evidence that moredn organizations have a remarkable ability to develop systems that tackle routine problems. But we also know that the more organizations use systems and structures that tackle routine problems to achieve better performance, the more they are likely to lose their ability to solve problems creatively (Jelinek, 1979; Miller, 1991). The challenge for organizations today, as it has always been, is how to carry on the task of routine problem solving without losing the ability to tackle problems creatively. 
</p>

<p>
- the authors argue that organizational actors develop a set of skills, social tactics and mental orientation that expresses "organizational ingenuity": the ability to create innovative solutions within structural constraints using limited resources and imaginative problem solving. 
</p>

<p>
...
</p>

<p>
Ingenious solutions often attract attention. They testify to our ability as humans to rise above the mundane - which is why they are often described as elegant, and at other times colloquially as "sweet." Aesthetics aside, the overriding priority is for organizations and societies to find solutions to pressing problems. Ingenuity may be culturally inspiring, but it cannot be an end in itself.
</p>

<p>
- standard definition of a creative solution: adapting Boden (1994:75-117), we can define a creative solution as combining novelty and value, where value is defined as "fitness for purpose." 
</p>

<p>
Based on this definition, one can argue that a solution is less creative if novelty is low but the fitness for purpose is adequate, i.e. the actors satisfice available solutions relative to the constraints. 
</p>

<p>
The transition from adequate to ingenious solution arises when novelty increases fitness for purpose, and when this increase is exponential. Thus, when a novel solution delivers far greater fitness for purpose than anticipated or necessary, we have arrived at an ingenious solution. 
</p>

<p>
HOXNOTE: "exponential" seems to mean the same as "qualitative difference;" it would be hard to say increase is exponential when "fitness" is a notoriously difficult concept to measure accurately!
</p>

<p>
In more general terms, in the face of constraints, actors are intent on finding solutions that are fit for a particular purpose. There may be individuals who are motivated by novelty (e.g. artists), and<br>
468<br>
organizations that value novelty for its own sake (e.g. universities), but in terms of legitimacy it is clear that fitness for purpose is the overriding criterion that allows actors to obtain the resources they need, and justify the solutions once they arise. Novelty matters to the extent that it increases fitness for purpose beyond the threshold required, and generally exceeds what most people expected.
</p>

<h1>On the Nature of Constraints</h1>

<br>

<p>
...
</p>

<p>
Constraints usually have negative connotations. We associate constraints with limits, boundaries, prescriptions and prohibitions. Thus, Rosso (this issue) defines constraints as the "state of being restricted, limited, or confined within prescribed bounds." Lombardo and Kvålshaugen (this issue) are more specific, defining constraints as "limitations or restrictions for what can or cannot be done in the problem solving, and for what the final solution should fulfill". If constraints limit what agents can do in a given situation, it is not surprising that reducing or eliminating constraints is often seen as a prerequisite to creativity. But such framing of the relationship between constraints and creativity in this fashion is misleading. In reality, the relationship between constraints and creativity is both negative and positive.
</p>

<p>
- positive impact of constraints:<br>
- Rosso (this issue) finds that R&amp;D temas described product requirements imposed by the organization in overwhelmingly positive terms<br>
- researchers such as Amabile (1988) see external constraints as antithetical to creativity, Rosso's respondents argue that the product requirements that are imposed by their top managers lend clarity and direction to their creative efforts
</p>

<p>
We tend to overlook constraints when they play a positive role. Constraints are often rules and regulations that protect workers, consumers and the public in general. Efficient markets depend on constraints. Remove constraints, for example by allowing excessive leveraging by financial institutions, and the result is often disastrous. Impose constraints on waste disposal and activities that<br>
468<br>
pollute and the result leads to more innovation rather than less.
</p>

<p>
- Cunha et al (2014) point out that scarcity of waste disposal in Japan "helps to explain why the Japanese cement industry now makes use of approximately 6 per cent of the country's waste and why the nation reports the smallest energy consumption per ton of cement produced among developed countries".<br>
- same is argued to be true for organizations: as organizations are forced to do more with less, and compete with more munificently endowed organizations, the adage "necessity is the mother of invention" becomes an imperative (Honig, Karlsson, and Hagg 2013).
</p>

<h1>Structural constraints</h1>

<br>

<p>
James Q. Wilson (2014, p. 352) has remarked that "we ought not to be surprised that organizations resist innovation. They are supposed to resist it... The standard operating procedure is not the enemy of organization; it is the essence of the organization."
</p>

<p>
- structural constraints are often the most complex and persistent obstacles to organizational ingenuity<br>
- ingenuity often requires circumventing or re-focusing organizational norms that may be strongly embedded in organizational routines and practices that define organizational life, irrespective of their efficiency or contribution (Meyer and Rowan 1977)
</p>

<p>
Obstacles: social, political, regulatory and commercial
</p>

<p>
In retrospect achievements such as Edison's seem so persuasive that it is easy to fall victim to hindsight bias, i.e. to assume that a product or a system is so obviously a superior solution that simply presenting it to the public ensures that widespread adoption will follow (Lampel, 2001).
</p>

<p>
Business history provides many examples of exceptionally creative solutions that did not reach the market, or reached the market but failed commercially, not because they did not address important technological and social problems but because they were stymied by structural constraints and organizational barriers. 
</p>

<h1>Resource constraints</h1>

<br>

<p>
Resource constraints often motivate actors to work towards high fitness-for-purpose solutions. These may involve bricolage, improvisation, bootlegging and scavenging - to mention practices that have long been covert but have recently attracted considerable attention from researchers<br>
470<br>
(Baker and Nelson, 2005; Kannan-Narasimhan, this issue). In these activities actors demonstrate ingenuity by addressing constraints that stand in the way of attaining creative solutions.
</p>

<p>
- Outokumpu case<br>
- early days of Amazon: faced security issues related to internet transactions; solution was to put sensitive information on a floppy disk and "walk it" across the room once a day for immediate and secure billing (Spector, 2009)
</p>

<h1>Temporal constraints</h1>

<br>

<p>
- substantial research on the impact of time constraints on creativity (Amabile, 1988; Baer and Oldham, 2006)<br>
- key argument here: time constraints reduce search scope, and thus may lead to adoption of substandard or inferior solutions<br>
- other research suggests a curvilinear relationship where time constraints (up to a point) may lead to better solutions<br>
- uses Apollo 13 case!!!<br>
- time constraints point to the new literature on attention-based strategy<br>
- this literature suggests attention the crucial resource, and allocating it efficiently is one of the most important predictors of success (Ocasio and Joseph, 2005)<br>
- time constraints may lead to a better allocation of attention (again Apollo 13 reference)<br>
- may sometimes lead to suboptimal solution but can also mean that actors are more likely to explore in depth possible solutions that are more ingenious
</p>

<h1>Reframing problems: bypassing constraints</h1>

<br>

<p>
- sometimes, instead of dealing with constraints, ingenious solutions occur by avoiding constraints that others see as imperative<br>
- example: Wright brothers recognized that propeller design required them to think of the propeller as an airfoil in calculations - couldn't just substitute air pressure for water pressure and use ship propeller calculating rules (Weber 2006)
</p>

<p>
471
</p>

<h1>Constraints and problem recognition</h1>

<br>

<p>
The papers in this special issue generally invoke constraints as a generic term, signifying restrictions, boundaries and limitations, or point to technical, economic, legal or organizational constraints in a particular context
</p>

<p>
- identifies two dimensions that shape problem recognition and influence solutions:
</p>

<p>
Static vs. dynamic: Constraints generally fall along a continuum between static and dynamic. Rules and regulations are typically relatively static constraints. They are static in the sense that actors do not expect them to change in the short run. If they change in the medium to long term, actors usually have advanced notice of this change. Resources, on the other hand, including time, when viewed as a resource, are more flexible and hence impose variable constraints. Frequently, resources can be borrowed, or converted from other allocations. Money, for instance, represents a highly variable resource constraint because, as Kannan-Narasimhan (this issue) points out, it is highly fungible. The variability of human resources can be an important constraint in knowledge-based industries where motivating and scaling up the initiative and creativity of labour is an important potential advantage. In contrast, tangible resources such as machines are often constrained by their design, but even here constraints are variable if the operators acquire an intimate understanding that allows them to develop new uses.
</p>

<p>
Dolmans et al. (this issue) argue that resource constraints are intrinsically variable because their limits depend on what entrepreneurs perceive to be their future use. As they put it: "...entrepreneurs' perceptions of resource positions are not static but transient and changing over time. Perceived resource positions can change any time a situation involves some reflection on (anticipated) available resources relative to (anticipated) resource demand. 
</p>

<p>
472
</p>

<p>
Explicit vs. implicit: <br>
<ul>
<li>some constraints are explicit and immediately recognized, others have to be derived, inferred from a situation or a problem.</li>
<li>Pols (2002) uses the example of an architect who is faced with the challenge of designing a house to illustrate the difference</li>
<li>specification for the house includes a range of explicit constriants, but there are also implicit constraints that go with assumptions of what a house is supposed to include, e.g. bathrooms, or a staircase if there is more than one floor, etc. </li>
<li>solving the design problems entails dealing with both explicit and implicit constraints</li>
<li>creative problem solving may involve recognizing that certian implicit constraints can be dropped</li>
<li>e.g. save space by eliminating stairs with an elevator</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Implicit constraints are often inferred, but as this example illsutrates they also represent taken-for-granted assumptions, cognitive limitations.
</p>

<p>
...
</p>

<p>
If we take this classification as generating four quadrants, then constraints-driven creative problem solving will vary in the two extreme quadrants, i.e. fixed/explicit vs. variable/implicit. Actors in the static/explicit are more likely to approach problem solving from an analytical perspective. 
</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li>most research on problem solving is of this type</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Those in the static/implicit category may face limitations based on cognitive assumptions that may not actually apply. <br>
<ul>
<li>trial and error may yield workable designs here; or insight that identifies implicit assumptions and makes them an explicit part of the analysis</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
In contrast, actors in the dynamic/implicit quadrant are more likely to depend on clever resource acquisition practices and restructuring or reframing the problem, i.e. seeing that certain constraints do not apply (Gibbert and Scranton, 2009). 
</p>

<p>
...
</p>

<p>
Finally, problems in the dynamic/explicit quadrant consist of known problems that face dynamic constraints.<br>
<ul>
<li>example: invention of the parking meter. Parking became a problem with cars that didn't need to be taken care of like horses, which could not be left "parked" for long periods. As the number of cars increased, this became problematic. In 1932, a local newspaper editor in Oklahoma City, Carl Magee, came up with the parking meter (Crossen, 2007). His solution consisted of reframing the parking problem </li>
</ul>
473<br>
from a technical one (lack of parking space) to an economic one: how do you incentivize people to reduce their use of parking space?
</p>

<h1>Creative Problem Solving under Constraints</h1>

<br>

<p>
<ul>
<li>theories of creative problem solving describe generally a multi-stage process, beginning with emergence of the problem, followed by efforts to solve the problem, the discovery of a solution, and then verification that the problem is indeed solved (Bilton, 2007, p. 8).</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
The emergence of the problem plays a pivotal role in how the problem is defined and tackled. In organizational terms we found it useful to apply Burgelman's (2002) distinction between induced vs. autonomous strategy processes, to "induced" and "autonomous" problem generation. 
</p>

<p>
- induced problem generation sees the problem as emerging independently of the actors that are tasked to solve it; actors do not initiate the process leading to the emergence of the problem, and they do not fundamentally alter the scope of the problem as defined by others<br>
- e.g. top management instructing engineering department to deal with a specific problem<br>
- engineering dept. takes the problem and given and the solution as stipulated<br>
- their first step (Simon and Newell, 1971:151) is to represent the problem in "problem space"<br>
- this representation identifies a range of constraints, and assumes others<br>
- then the engineers will generate a "solution space" which may call for improved design, or if the cost if prohibitive, new instructions to the user
</p>

<p>
The autonomous view sees the emergence of problems as contingent on how actors interpret organizational performance relative to the aspirations or goals they set for themselves. Unlike the induced view where there is a separation between actors that induce the problem and actors who are tasked with solving the problem, here the actors that define the problem are also the actors that are directly involved in the search for solutions. 
</p>

<p>
- useful starting point as per Banerjee (2014): Cyert and March's (1963) behavioral theory of the firm. <br>
- this theory argues that organizations judge their performance relative to previously set aspirations<br>
- if performance falls below aspirations, the organization will initiate a "problemistic search" for solutions that improve performance; or it may revise its aspirations downward
</p>

<p>
<span class="zim-tag">@HOXNOTE</span> this is somehow linked to techno-nationalistic actions seen at Outokumpu case
</p>

<p>
Constraints clearly play a role in whether the organization adopts the first or second option, but it is important to note that, unlike the first view, organizational decision makers have the choice of whether to engage in problemistic search or to downgrade their aspirations. The choice will depend on how decision makers interpret constraints.
</p>

<p>
- e.g. in severe economic downturn, orgs more likely to revise aspirations downwards rather than engage in problemistic search<br>
- if they have substantial slack resources on the other hand, they may decide to ignore depressed consumer demand and engage in problemistic search even if this incurs costs
</p>

<p>
Lombardo and Kvålshaugen (this issue) illustrate the induced perspective. (of creative problem solving)
</p>

<p>
474
</p>

<p>
- builds on Onarheim's (2012) suggestion that when actors search for design solutions there are four practices available: 
</p>

<p>
a) "black boxing", treating certain constraints as unchangeable and focusing on constraints that are considered more crucial<br>
b) "removal", or setting aside temporarily highly fixed constraints to see if new solutions emerge which were previously overlooked<br>
c) "introducing," the practice of identifying and adding implicit constraints to make the problem clearer<br>
d) "revision," going back and looking at constraints that stand in the way of a creative solution to see if they can be revised or redefined. 
</p>

<p>
Lombardo and Kvålshaugen (this issue) argue that the practices that actors will employ will be influenced by the power relationship with their clients. 
</p>

<p>
475
</p>

<p>
... when we speak of organizational ingenuity as creative problem solving under constraints we must distinguish between two types of constraints. The first type consists of constraints that partially or completely define problems, and the second are constraints that stand in the way of solving the problem creatively. Rosso (this issue) refers to the first as "product constraints" and to the second as "process constraints." 
</p>

<p>
- example from Microsoft's development of "Longhorn" (Windows Vista)
</p>

<p>
476
</p>

<p>
- this may refer to <span class="zim-tag">@HOXNOTE</span> access/entitlement issues! 
</p>

<p>
The most pervasive process constraints that face organizational actors when it comes to tackling product constraints creatively derive from lack of adequate resources. In many isntances, resources are available elsewhere in the organization, but not accessible to the innovators. As Kannan-Narasimhan (this issue) puts it, innovators often find themselves in an "interesting contradiction; at the individual level they face constraints in accessing resources for innovation but at the organizational level their organization holds the resources they need." Research suggests that, broadly speaking, when actors are in this position they either seek ingenious ways of making do with the resources they have at their disposal, or they find ways of ingeniously obtaining additional resources, or both. Practices are brought into play such as "bricolage," - "making do by applying combinations of resources at hand to new problems and opportunities" (Baker and Nelson, 2005:333) and "bootstrapping," which involves retaining cash by delaying payment, or employing underused equipment. In contrast, Kannan-Narasimhan (this issue) lists practices such as "borrowing," "begging," "scavenging," "amplifying," "bootlegging," and "finangling" as methods that allow actors to obtain additional resources.
</p>

<p>
...
</p>

<p>
At one level all these practices seek to address resource constraints that hamper the ability of actors to solve problems, but at another they represent the actors' attempt to deal with process constraints. Put differently, when actors engage in these practices they acknowledge that their organization's resource allocation process is indifferent, or even hostile, to the goals they wish to pursue. 
</p>

<p>
<span class="zim-tag">@HOXNOTE</span> nickel constraints would be an excellent example case of how actors actually promote and prolong the institutional constraints! see also Lombardo and Kvålshaugen, who examine teams that employ both rhetoric and hard bargaining to have constraints relaxed

<h1>Concluding Comments</h1>

<br>

<p>
...
</p>

<p>
A key objective of this special issue is to persuade researchers that ingenuity is not merely a term used to describe a highly creative solution to a problem, but a proper subject of research that is important to our understanding of how organizations make small improvements, that are nevertheless crucial, or achieve breakthroughs that can change entire industries. Future research on ingenuity should encompass creative problem solving that is localized as well as cases where ingenuity is globally transformative. 
</p>

<p>
- media tends to lavish attention to high-tech pioneers, but industries where ingenuity occurs but is rarely noticed should also warrant study
</p>

<p>
- questions remain!<br>
- no good understanding of how ingenuity can be scaled up; small firsm often owe their reputations to their ability to creatively solve problems despite resource constraints, growth generates structural constraints that undermine organizational ingenuity; research needed to examine how organizations evolve and manage ingenuity through their own life cycle and through the environmental changes they must address over time<br>
- how to keep ingenuity intact! 
</p>

<p>
<span class="zim-tag">@HOXNOTE</span> <span class="zim-tag">@Outokumpu</span> could study Outotec here!!!
</p>

<p>
- another overlooked research opportunity: how might an organization that is successful at solving problems in a static environment learn to do so in a dynamic one?
</p>

<p>
480
</p>

<p>
Most of the aforementioned opportunities require a longitudinal and a comparative perspective.
