Table 3.8 
</p>

<p>
Surface, extent of forests, forests on total surface, population, and forests per inhabitant Europe around <br>
1900
</p>

<p>
- woods per capita in GB and Ireland 0.03, Netherlands 0.05, Belgium 0.08, France 0.24
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
- specifying precisely the relative share of total consumption used by domestic and industrial demand respectively is hard: quantitative estimates only exist for iron<br>
- estimate production in 1500 as 100 000 tons, 1 million tons in 1800<br>
- estimate need for wood 30 kg per kg of iron<br>
- firewood exploited at the beginning of the 16th century about 5 % and 20-25% in 1800<br>
- when firewood consumed for other industrial usages such as working of non-ferrous metals, glass, bricks, salt and food is added, the total may have reached something like 20% at the beginning the early modern period  and certainly more, approaching 40%, at the end
</p>

<p>
- one hectare produced about 3-4 kg of wood per day<br>
- in northern europe this was required per day in cities per inhabitant<br>
- a city of 10 000 inhabitants needed 10 000 hectares of forest and 30-50 carts daily to transport wood from nearby forests; add to this feeding the draft animals
</p>

<p>
59
</p>

<p>
- a hectare of European forest could produce 1.5 to 2 cubic meters of wood, and a well-managed woodland even 3 or more<br>
- weight of this wood was about 625 kg per cubic meter, providing 1 875 000 kcal<br>
- per capita consumption of wood in Europe was 2-4 kg per day, meaning annual consumption of 0.7 to 1.5 tons, or 6000 to 12 000 kcal per day<br>
- Braudel calculates that to meet the annual consumption of 150 million Europeans in the middle of the eighteenth century, the need for forest would have been 160 million hectares, which is about a third of the extent of the continent without Russia<br>
- efficiency of firewood was modest, 5-15 %<br>
- argues that there were possibilities for intensification within European agriculture, and these were exploited in the 19th century; but 
</p>

<p>
...the dependency of energy consumption on organic and vegetable carriers did not allow the kind of development subsequently experienced by the European economy and that we now call modern growth, by which in the long term a faster growth of output than population leads in turn to an improved standard of living.
</p>

<p>
Table 3.10: equivalence of measures concerning wood
</p>

<p>
kg of firewood = 3000 kcal<br>
kg of charcoal = 7300 kcal<br>
kg of charcoal requires 5.5 kg firewood
</p>

<p>
- peat was used but around urbanised areas such as Flanders, local supplies were soon exhausted<br>
- London could not have grown from 50 000 inhabitants in the 16th to 600 000 in the eighteenth and 1 million by the nineteenth without coal<br>
- coal was very probably more important than wood as provider of thermal energy by the 1620s; production of coal in England increased 7-8 times between 1530 and 1630<br>
- share of coal: 12% in 1560, 20% in 1600, and 50% in 1700
</p>

<p>
More and more industrial activities turned to these new sources of energy: from weapon and gunpowder production to that of alum, bricks, tiles, and glass, and from salt, beer, and soap production, to sugar refineries.
</p>

<p>
- in 1650, 55% of coal was used for heating, 33% in industry, rest for other uses and exported
</p>

<p>
65
</p>

<p>
water mills:<br>
- in the 11th and 12th centuries the ratio of water mills to the population was approximately one mill to every 250-300 people, which means that more or less every village had at least one mill. The same ratio ... prevailed in early modern Europe until the end of the eighteenth century. <br>
- ordinary water mill seldom exceeded 3 hp, in the 19th century, more powerful mills became common, but during late middle ages the average was 2 hp or less<br>
- ordinary Watt steam engine of 1800 had 10-15 times this power, 20 to 30 hp
</p>

<p>
71
</p>

<p>
All things considered, at least 60-70 percent of economic output directly or indirectly aimed at providing or conserving energy in premodern agrarian societies.
</p>

- in the first half of the 19th century, energy consumption per capita was around 13 000 kcal/day or 20 Gj/a, excluding coal, and 15 000 and 23, if coal is included<br>
- useful energy was then about 2000-2500 kcal per day without coal, which means around 3-4 hp (such as simple water mill) working for an hour or a man working 60-80 hours or a Watt's steam engine working 6-7 minutes
</p>

</p>

<p>
If Britain was already emerging from the "photosynthetic constraint" in the seventeenth century, why did an industrial revolution, and a "take-off" of energy consumption, not occur earlier and more widely? This was because the increase in the quantity of available energy was only one of the shifts required to build a modern energy economy. The second, and perhaps more profound, was a qualitative change: the capacity to convert thermal energy into kinetic energy, or stated simply, to turn heat into motion. 
</p>

<p>
...
</p>

<p>
The quantitative and qualitative developments in the energy economy had to be closely linked to bring about general progress, because the use of engines powered by coal would be essential to two processes that undid constraints still operative even in eighteenth-century Britain. The first was to dig deeper mines and access seams that were not exploitable in an earlier age. The second was to drive a transport revolution that meant, through the use of locomotives and steam ships, that bulky coal, raw materials and machinery could be affordably brought to sites across the continent and beyond. This brought a revolution in the use of energy and power beyond anything that could be achieved by the most ingenious millwright with water and wind. 
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
It has sometimes been treated as a puzzle why the great coal reserves of China, which became a very major part of global consumption early in the twenty-first century, were not exploited earlier. But by and large they were far from the commercial and agricultural heartlands of the country, which were clustered toward the southern and eastern coasts. In the cities of China, fuel remained very expensive relative to the centres of European growth. Charcoal in Canton was five times the price of coal in London. 
</p>

<p>
366
</p>

<p>
It is a central part of our argument that pre-industrial Europe faced energy constraints to economic growth, and was set free from these constraints by the adoption of fossil fuels, first of all coal. We find it hard to imagine anything like modern economic growth occurring without this, and we view the transition to fossil fuels as a necessary condition, and an enabling factor leading to modern growth. The energy constraints of pre-industrial Europe had been of two kinds: land area and power. Around 95 percent of aggregated primary energy consumption depended on organic raw materials, requiring vast areas for its product, only achieving what were by later standards low levels of productivity. The only sources for motive power were human muscles, draft animals, and water- and windmills, all with low power. Europe was especially hard hit by these constraints because of the relatively low land productivity compared to, for instance, parts of east Asia, differences that stemmed from natural resources like soil quality and climate...
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
- England was the only country at that point in time where it made sense to develop the steam engine as an economically useful innovation<br>
- first engines had less than 1% thermal efficiency so they could only be placed at pitheads of coal mines, where fuel was virtually free<br>
368
</p>

<p>
Without cheap coal there could not have been cheap iron and steel production, and without cheap iron the costs of capital would have been much higher, with a strong detrimental impact on industrialisation. 
</p>

<p>
373
</p>

<p>
- did that fossil fuel have to be coal? 
</p>

<p>
Could we then not imagine development "leapfrogging" to more energy-efficient development blocks (as we have seen emerging, with hindsight)? Could we not have skipped the coal-iron-steam block and jumped directly to oil and internal combustion engines? This seems unlikely to us. We do not think it is likely that the internal combustion engine would have been invented directly without the steam engine first. The same goes for the possibility of jumping directly to using a secondary energy carrier like electricity.
</p>

<p>
- oil available in Europe only far away from major sources of demand: Polish Galicia, Romania, the southern Caucasus
</p>

<p>
374
</p>

<p>
Thus, given the distribution of resources and knowledge in the eighteenth-century world economy, it seems very unlikely that the conditions would have arisen for the development of large-scale use of "alternative" modern energy carriers without coal, even if there is no reason to think that Europe could not have continued on a track of ingenious technological advance that might incorporate some use of energy carriers that would become significant in the twentieth century (albeit with rather lesser incentives for labor saving than the coal-steam-iron block presented).
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
As early as 1611, an obscure English pamphleteer and booster for the planting of trees, Arthur Standish, wondered whether (as some said) coal could provide a long-term substitute for firewood. His answer was negative: wood grew back after being felled, but a coal mine, once exhausted, was gone forever. On this logic of sustainability, Standish rejected a future for coal. (Standish 1611, Warde, 2006)
