How do innovators in large organizations acquire resources for their early-stage, untested, unproven innovations?
</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li>innovators pursuing early-stage, untested innovations face considerable constraints in accessing scarce resources. </li>
<li>literature contains numerous examples of sanctioned and unsanctioned methods by which innovators acquire resources, e.g. borrowing, begging, scavenging, amplifying, bootlegging and finangling</li>
<li>but few theories explain HOW innovators act unconventionally, elude constraints to acquire resources, and yet gain acceptance for their innovations</li>
<li>uses field data from nine organizations based primarily in Silicon Valley</li>
<li>finds that successful innovators employ organizational ingenuity or creative solutions to gain resources in the face of constraints</li>
<li>two types of ingenuity are employed: 
<ul>
<li>MATERIAL INGENUITY, which means "creatively re-imagining the use of resources, and </li>
<li>PROCESS INGENUITY, which refers to using creative processes to gain resources.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In the early stages, innovators focus on managing their innovation's legitimacy and use <b>managerial attention</b> as a key lever</li>
<li>when employing <b>material ingenuity,</b> they maximize managerial attention; when utilizing <b>process ingenuity,</b> they minimize it</li>
<li>Theories highlighting the relationship between legitimacy and resource acquisition suggest that individuals gain resources when they establish legitimacy. </li>
<li>Conversely, study indicates that <b>the process of gaining resources can lend legitimacy to early-stage innovations</b></li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
484
</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li>Resources for innovations are scarce because multiple established projects compete for resources, and unproven innovations are often viewed as illegitimate in large organizations; thus, innovators face significant constraints in accessing those resources</li>
<li>Organizational structures in large, mature organizations tend to reinforce existing practices and stifle unexpected bottom-up innovations</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li>Zimmermann and Zeitz (2002) and Zott and Huy (2007) suggest that the key to acquiring resources is gaining <b>legitimacy,</b> the social judgment of appropriateness and desirability</li>
<li>Legitimacy is gained by demonstrating proof of potential success</li>
<li>Uses Lampel, Honig and Drori (2011) to tell that "literature suggests that innovators in large organizations use organizational ingenuity</li>
<li>Defines <b>organizational ingenuity</b> as <i>creative solutions that individuals use to gain resources despite the structural constraints of their organization</i></li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
<b>RESEARCH GAP:</b> Prior research has highlighted the various sanctioned and unsanctioned methods that innovators use to gain resources, the (1) process by which they negotiate organizational constraints to access resources and (2) the effects of such actions on innovation legitimacy is not well documented<br>
<ul style='padding-left: 30pt'>
<li>Little theory exists on the process by which innovators evade structural constraints to access resources yet manage to gain legitimacy for early-stage ideas</li>
<li>To address the gap, this study examines how innovators gain resources for their early-stage innovations by negotiating structural constraints and the effects of such action on their innovation's legitimacy</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
<b>CONVERSATION:</b> Builds upon a growing number of studies that address the micro-institutional context of established firms focusing on innovators within large organizational structures (e.g. van Dijk et al, 2011; Vermuelen et al., 2007)
</p>

<p>
485
</p>

<p>
<b>APPROACH:</b> grounded theory
</p>

<p>
<b>DATA:</b>  99 interviews with innovators and senior managers in nine large, high-tech organizations from Silicon Valley's IT and computing sector; additional data from confidential and public documents, innovation blogs, and site visits
</p>

<p>
<b>RESULTS:</b> <br>
<ul>
<li>innovators employ two types of organizational ingenuity to gain resources for early-stage innovations:
<ul>
<li>Material ingenuity (meanwhile, gaining legitimacy by maximizing managerial attention; showing that innovators were utilizing resources that the organization had invested in but were currently wasting or underutilized)</li>
<li>Process ingenuity (meanwhile, minimizing managerial attention; using resources that other well established projects in the organization were competing for) </li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
<b>IMPLICATIONS:</b> for understanding of how innovators gain resources and legitimacy for their early stage innovations<br>
<ul>
<li>prior studies had emphasized process ingenuity for gaining innovation resources</li>
<li>this study identifies and distinguishes between two types of organizational ingenuity (material- and process-)</li>
<li>this study highlights the role of managerial attention in the relationship between resource acquisition and the legitimacy that is accorded to early-stage innovations
<ul>
<li>prior studies did not clarify the relationship between innovators' resource acquisition strategies, managerial attention and its impact on innovation's legitimacy</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>Theoretical background</h2>

<br>

<p>
<ul>
<li>Builds on three main literature bases:
<ul>
<li><b>research on resource acquisition under constraints and organizational ingenuity</b> 
<ul>
<li>notion of organizational ingenuity is relatively new, but instances are found throughout the literatures of entrepreneurship and innovation</li>
<li>two well-established concepts are bootstrapping (Ebben and Johnson, 2006; Bhide, 2000; Brush et al, 2006; Landstrom and Winborg, 2005) and bricolage (Baker and Nelson, 2005)
<ul>
<li>note that some, but not all, actions classified as bootstrapping and bricolage are instances of organizational ingenuity</li>
<li>for an action to be ingenious, it must demonstrate creativity and focus on resource acquisition under constraints <span class="zim-tag">@HOXNOTE</span> really?</li>
<li>bricolage does not pre-suppose constraints, but emphasizes creativity through re-imagining the use of resources</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>the relationship between legitimacy and resource acquisition</b> 
<ul>
<li>General definition of "legitimacy:" //the perception that an actor's behavior is desirable and appropriate within a socially-constructed system of norms, values, beliefs, and definitions (Suchman, 1995). </li>
<li>Innovators within organizations gain legitimacy when their actions are perceived as desirable within the organization's socially-constructed systems</li>
<li>Innovators also have to strive for internal legitimacy (Drori and Honig, 2013): 
<ul>
<li>their innovation should gain the consensus of other organizational participants, <b>INTERNAL VALIDATION</b></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>legitimacy and resources are gained by gaining endorsement from sponsors, tapping into the organization's internal expertise, and showing small advances (Markham, 2002; Morris et al, 2010)</li>
<li>Different types of legitimacy: 
<ul>
<li>legitimacy based on governance structures (Hale, 2004)</li>
<li>cognitive legitimacy when showing small advances (Suchman, 2005)</li>
<li>procedural legitimacy by conforming to existing structures when accessing unused resources (Suchman, 2005)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Prior studies suggest that gaining legitimacy for innovations is challenging (e.g. Dougherty and Heller, 1994; Zimmermann and Zeitz, 2002; Zott and Huy, 2007) but a prerequisite for gaining resources</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>theories of managerial attention</b>
<ul>
<li>Managerial attention defined as <i>how organizational decision-makers notice, encode, interpret, and focus their time and efforts upon organizational issues and answers</i> (Ocasio 1997)</li>
<li>Theories of attention suggest managers are bombarded with information (Cho and Hambrick, 2006; Cyert and March, 1963)</li>
<li>They therefore attend events selectively while ignoring others (Weick et al., 2005)</li>
<li>Allocation of attention defined by how organizational decision-makers interpret the meaning of events (Ocasio, 1997)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
488<br>
<ul>
<li>Prior literature suggests three main findings:</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
<ol type="1" start="1">
<li>Most studies that focus on resources acquisition under constraints by individuals focus on independent entrepreneurs
<ol type="a" start="1">
<li>suggest that entrepreneurs facing resource constraints engage in a variety of strategies (bootstrapping, bricolage) to gain resources at very little or no cost</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>entrepreneurs of new ventures gain resources when they demonstrate legitimacy for their enterprises or innovation
<ol type="a" start="1">
<li>again, focus on individual entrepreneurs and not on innovators in large organizations</li>
<li>however, innovators in large organizations seem to face resource challenges that are different from independent entrepreneurs</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>the few studies that focus on innovators in large organizations suggest that innovators in these organizations tend to access resources without their manager's approval
<ol type="a" start="1">
<li>they then demonstrate proof of success of innovation to gain legitimacy</li>
<li>but the process by which innovators in large organizations negotiate their organizational constraints and managerial attention to gain resources, and the impact of their actions on innovation legitimacy, is not well-documented</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
489
</p>

<p>
<b>RESEARCH GAPS FILLED:</b> 
</p>

<p>
<ol type="1" start="1">
<li>Focuses on early-stage innovators in large organizations where individuals face a paradox of resource constraints at the individual level for their innovation, when resources are available in the organization</li>
<li>While previous studies have underscored the importance of legitimacy as a prerequisite to gaining resources, this study emphasizes the importance of the process of acquiring resources as a legitimating procedure that subsequently leads to innovation legitimacy</li>
<li>Previous studies in large orgs have identified process ingenuity as a key route to gaining resources and have emphasized the importance of minimizing managerial attention to gain innovation legitimacy; in contrast, this study emphasizes the need to handle managerial attention differently when using material ingenuity versus process ingenuity for gaining resources under organizational constraints</li>
</ol>
