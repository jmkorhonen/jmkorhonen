"a paper where the handling of constraints is, in itself, considered to be a creative act."<br>
"creativity can be expressed in the problem definition and solution assessment phases of problem solving as well, not just in the generative state (3-state model of problem solving, Newell and Simon 1972)"<br>
"people 1) protest openly against constraints, 2) propose alternative solutions to work around the constraint while not protesting openly, 3) do not protest nor accept the constraint, but work silently on "illegal" ideas and therefore betray the constraints; and 4) work secretly against the unwanted consequences of a given constraint in an act of sabotage, changing the rules of the game and imposing their own agendas" (pp. 604-605) <br>
"The logic of shattering is one of targeting constraints and releasing disruptive action against them. The scope of shattering, contained in its logic, is limited to challenging the validity of the constraints, and momentarily unchaining whoever is blocked in their tight grip. This liberation opens the possibility of creativity, but is independent from any preset creative goal." (p. 607)

</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<br>

<p>
<ul>
<li>Ill-structured problem-solving (see Newell et al. 1962) in project organizations is characterized by a need to handle any kind of constraint</li>
<li>how constraints are handled can affect the search for successful and creative solutions</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Theoretical and empirical researches articulate constraints as both enabling and restraining creative work (Negus and Pickering 2004; Stokes, 2008; Joyce, 2009; Onarheim and Wiltshnig, 2010; Onarheim and Biskjaer, in press)<br>
<ul>
<li>studies that see constraints as detrimental to creativity: (Salter and Gann, 2003; Hennessey and Amabile, 2010)</li>
<li>others find that constraints are a prerequisite for creativity (Dyer et al, 2009; Joyce, 2009)</li>
<li>still others that constraints lead to creative breakthroughs (Stokes, 2005)</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
588
</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li>most studies on constraint handling define creativity in terms of the output of the creative act, rather than in terms of individual's actions</li>
<li>however, there are widely known defitional issues in creativity research</li>
<li>Creative problem solving entails handling constraints (Sternberg and Kaufman, 2010)
<ul>
<li>this interesting phenomenon has attracted many scholars (Lubart, 1994; Csikszentmihalyi, 1996; Chevalier and Ivory, 2003) who have produced evidence about numerous constraint-handling practices (Gero, 1990; Stokes, 2007; Onarheim, 2012; Onarheim and Biskjaer, in press)</li>
<li>these studies have generally treated constraints, regardless of their nature, origin, or role, as external factors that enable or hinder creativity (e.g. Stokes, 2007; Onarheim and Wiltschnig, 2010)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>these approaches may lead us to overlook the <b>possibility of viewing constraint handling as something inherent in creative action</b></li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
We risk ignoring the possible role of creative action in the non-generative parts of the problem space [creative act], and dismissing any creative action that does not connect directly with useful outputs. Constraint handling is thus reduced to a form of "creativity maximization", and cases in which constraint handling originates creative action without being related to any preset creative goal might be neglected.
</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li>develops the study of constraint handling from within theories of action that view all human actions as inherently creative, such as the theory of action of American pragmatism (James, 1922; Peirce, 1932-58; Mead and Morris, 1938; Dewey, 1958). </li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
This theory provides a clear role for constraint handling in the definition of creative action. According to pragmatists, human action involves problem solving and develops creatively by shattering old constraints and reconstructing new ones (Joas, 1996). In this context, "shattering" is defined as a disruption of the status quo. Pragmatists consider constraint shattering as a fundamental form of constraint handling and as a source of creative action. Thus, <b>creativity can be understood by means of its connection to constraint handling. </b>Stokes (2007) acknowledges this line of thought while proposing rejection (Gardner, 1993) and replacement (Boden, 1994) as two basic forms of constraint handling. Yet, we do not know enough about how shattering is enacted by practicioners. Thus, we ask: <i>How do project teams shatter constraints in ill-structured problem-solving situations, and what implications does this finding have for the understanding of creative action in organizations?</i> 
</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li>aim to elucidate a specific set of constraint-handling practices that are most likely to be used, regardless of the goal of creative performance</li>
<li>in the author's opinion, this approach is important for extending the understanding of the scope of creative action beyond the generative part (e.g. Ball et al, 1997; Stokes, 2005; Onarheim, 2012) to <b>other parts of the problem space (i.e. problem definition and solution assessment phases.</b> </li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>Constraints and Creative Action</h2>

<br>

<p>
Constraint handling is commonly studied in connection with creative problem solving (e.g. Chevalier and Ivory, 2003; Onarheim, 2012; Stacey and Eckert, 2010; Stokes, 2007), with the creative output being seen as a goal of constraint handling. <b>Recent literature reviews (Onarheim, 2012; Onarheim and Biskjaer, in press) find great variation in the definition of "constraints,"</b>  ranging from <br>
<ul>
<li>generic typologies (e.g. Amabile, 1996; Elster, 2000; Stokes and Fisher, 2005; Lawson, 2006) to </li>
<li>ad hoc typologies that focus on domain-specific constraints (e.g. Gross, 1986; Gero, 1990; Goldratt, 1990; King and Majchrzak, 1996; Nuseibeh and Easterbrook, 2000; Darlington, 2002; Andrews, 2003; Chevalier and Ivory, 2003; Abuhamedeh and Csikszentmihaluyi, 2004; Johnson, 2005; Lewandowski, 2007)</li>
<li>in the creativity literature, ad hoc conceptualizations tend to define constraints based on their effects on the creative endeavour (Amabile, 1982; Stokes, 2008; Sternberg and Kaufman, 2010)</li>
<li>for our purposes, we define constraints as <i>limitations or restrictions for what can or cannot be done in the problem solving, and for what the final solutions hould fulfill</i> (Onarheim, 2012:324) and acknowledge that many constraints may exist at any point in a project (Hull, Jackson and Dick, 2005)</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
<b>Problem solving</b> comprises activities that occur in a problem space (Newell and Simon, 1972). The problem space contains three parts<br>
<ul>
<li>an initial state (problem)</li>
<li>a goal state (its solution)</li>
<li>a generative state</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
with constraints applying to each. Diverse strategies and rules are applied to move from the initial to the goal state (Stokes, 2007). In the early problem-solving phases, practicioners must define the goal state (Simon, 1973; Darke, 1979; Voss and Post, 1988), a challenge that entails <i>finding</i> constraints in the problem, <i>resolving</i> contradictory constraints (Stacey and Eckert, 2010), and <i>transforming</i> such constraints into descriptions of the envisaged solution path (Gero, 1990). Through these activities, the practicioner establishes an understanding of the status quo of the problem and the need for a change to reach the goal state (Simon, 1978). The practicioner produces creative solutions in the generative part, facilitated by the shattering of constraints.
</p>

<p>
Some studies consider constraints to be external factors capable of influencing the creative production in the generative state <i>from the outside</i>. Constraints are presented as something that can direct and limit the search for solutions (Reitman, 1965; Stokes, 2007), focus the creative effort (e.g. Isaak and Just, 1995; Ward, Smith and Finke, 1999), promote idea generation (e.g. Finke, Ward and Smith 1992; Amabile, Hadley and Kramer, 2002), or even lead to creative breakthroughs (Stokes, 2005). Other authors focus more explicitly on practitioners' handling of constraints during problem solving. ...
</p>

<p>
Some studies find that practicioners balance between <i>eliminating</i> constraints to open possibilities and <i>introducing</i> new constraints to secure control (Csikszentmihalyi, 1997; Amabile, 1998; Baer and Oldham, 2006; Joyce, 2009; Liikkanen, HÃ¤mÃ¤lÃ¤inen and Koskinen, 2009). Constraint elimination takes various forms, such as <i>black-boxing</i> constraints (i.e. accepting specific constraints as unchangeable, while focusing on more "crucial" constraints); <i>temporarily removing</i> constraints (i.e. to search for potentially overlooked solutions); and <i>revising</i> constraints (i.e. to solve creative hindrances ) (Onarheim, 2012). New constraints can be introduced during the solution process by <i>self-imposition</i> (Onarheim, 2012), by <i>translating</i> constraints into different forms and exploring their implications (Stacey and Eckert, 2010), or simply by chance (Charnes and Cooper, 1959). These various strategies have been used throughout the literature (e.g. Simon, 1969; Johnson-Laird, 1988; Toye, 1993; Chi, 1997; Bonnardel, 2000; Jul, 2004; Simonton, 2004), providing evidence of how practitioners use constraints as tools to challenge and shatter the status quo.
</p>

<p>
590
</p>

<p>
In most of the above-mentioned studies, authors tend to view constraints as tools external to the domain of creative action; <br>
<ul>
<li>to consider constraint handling as a mechanism for maximizing creativity; </li>
<li>to define the creative action as something that produces a novel and useful output; and</li>
<li>to consider indiduals rather than groups or practices in their analyses</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li>authors argue that these conceptualizations lead to several shortcomings regarding our understanding of the relationship between constraint shattering and creative action. </li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
First, by viewing constraints as tools (Stokes, 2005), practitioners include constraint handling within the domain of problem solving, but conceptually outside the definition of creative action. They overlook the possibility that constraint handling may be something <i>inherent</i> in creative action, rather than an external factor. Practitioners might think that thye can <i>choose</i> whether or not to use constraint handling; instead, it could be that constraint shattering (as a form of constraint handling) is never optional in the performance of creative action. In this case, the practitioner must gain an understanding of <i>how constraint shattering can be used to manage creative action</i> and <i>to what degree constraint handling can be conceived as inherent in creative action.</i>
</p>

<p>
Second, existing research tends to present constraint handling as a form of "creativity maximization."<br>
<ul>
<li>no particular attention is paid to cases in which constraint handling <b>is</b> the creative action</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Practitioners risk ignoring the possible role of creative action in the problem definition and solution assessment phases of the problem space, where there is no explicit goal of being creative. 
</p>

<p>
...
</p>

<p>
Third, most of the creativity literature considers an action as creative only when it produces a <i>novel and useful output</i> (Kaufmann, 2004). A creative output is explicitly assumed to be desirable. Under this assumption, actions that are not explicitly or directly involved in the production of novel and useful outputs can be dismissed as not creative or interesting. <br>
<ul>
<li>but such actions may be necessary steps towards subsequent actions that eventually achieve novel output or simply change the status quo</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
... This definition of creative action has other drawbacks: it requires that the output of the (potentially creative) action be assessable, and it does not account for inter-actor differences in what is considered creative (Sternberg and Kaufman, 2010).

<p>
<b>Pursuing the goals of novelty and usefulness is not problematic per se, although it may entail the risk of confusing the goal with the act of achieving it.</b>

Finally, most studies tend to neglect the group dimension, use the individual actor as the unit of analysis, and aim to explain the effect of constraint handling on the final product, rather than the constraint-handling practices as such.
