<h2>Constraints and Creativity</h2>

<br>

<p>
Creativity is defined as the production of ideas or solutions that are novel and useful (Amabile, 1988; 1996). In order for ideas or solutions to be considered creative in an organizational setting, they must be both new and potentially valuable to the organization (George, 2008). Creativity is a key precursor to innovation, which is the successful implementation of creative ideas (Amabile, 1996; Kurtzberg, 2005; West, 1997, 2002). Creativity thus produces a critical source of competitive advantage and lasting stakeholder value vital to the success of organizations relying on innovative products and technologies (George, 2008). 
</p>

<p>
The literature on creativity in organizations has been heavily influenced by Amabile's (1988) componential model of creativity, which suggests that <b>intrinsic motivation - the drive to engage in an activity because it is inherently interesting or involving - is essential to creative output</b> (Amabile 1988, 1996). A key conclusion from this theory, originally developed through the study of individual creative exemplars and children, is that intrinsic motivation, and therefore creativity, is maximized by freedom and inhibited by constraints. Proponents of this perspective argue that when external constraints are placed on the creative process, creators lose intrinsic motivation and fall back on routines and surface-level thinking, which kill creativity (Amabile, Hadley and Kramer 2002; Andrews and Smith, 1996). 
</p>

<p>
<i>External constraints,</i> defined as factors introduced by the social environment that are intended to control an individual's engagement in a task (Amabile, 1988, 1996) have a decidedly negative connotation in this tradition. This definition emphasizes controlling aspects of constraints, where constraints are dictated externally with little agency given to the actor upon whom the constraints are imposed. In the present study, for the sake of remaining more neutral about the nature and impact of constraints, <b>I define constraints broadly, as a state of being restricted, limited, or confined within prescribed bounds.</b> This definition allows for the possibility that constraints may arise internally as well as externally, and may have positive as well as negative connotations and consequences for R&amp;D teams. 
</p>

<h3>Constraints as inhibitors of creativity</h3>

<br>

<p>
<ul>
<li>"intrinsic motivation perspective" has been the dominant theoretical paradigm in literature on constraints and creativity, but ther has been relatively limited empirical research on the topic</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
554
</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li>most current research examining the impact of constraints on creativity has focused on time constraints</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
The presence of time pressures or production goals has typically been described as a negative influence on creativity because it discourages exploration and increases reliance on status quo approaches (Amabile, 1996). Researchers have argued that good creativity takes time (Gruber and Davis, 1988) and that creators need ample time and space to think creatively, suspend judgment, and play with ideas (Amabile and Gryskiewicz, 1987; Isaksen et al, 2001). Amabile, Hadley and Kramer (2002) found support for this premise in a longitudinal study of creative professionals, as has research on marketing professionals (Andrews and Smith, 1996) and psychological research on individual creativity in a group task (Kelly and McGrath, 1985).
</p>

<p>
Other research has examined the impact of financial and other resource constraints on creativity, primarily at the individual level. This work suggests that creators need to feel comfortable and provided with sufficient resources in order to be maximally creative (e.g. Amabile, 1988; Amabile and Gryskiewicz, 1987; Amabile et al., 1996; Katz and Allen, 1988). The innovation literature has also championed this perspective, with theorists largely arguing that innovation necessarily requires financial resource slack (Camison-Zornoza et al., 2004; Damanpour, 1991), and that financial constraints impair innovation either directly or through innovation teams blaming their constraints for taking an easier or less novel path. 
</p>

<h3>Constraints as enablers of creativity</h3>

<br>

<p>
<ul>
<li>mounting evidence suggesting that creative performance of individuals and teams can actually benefit from constraints</li>
<li>most research on CREATIVITY focused again on time constraints</li>
<li>Andrews and Farris (1972) found positive, significant relations between scientists' experienced time pressure and their creativity</li>
<li>West (2002) proposed and Baer and Oldham (2006) found a curvilinear relationship between time pressure and individual creativity, where moderate levels of time pressure had positive effects on creativity</li>
<li>Amabile and colleagues (2002) found similar effects in a longitudinal study, </li>
<li>as did Ohly, Sonnentag and Pluntke (2006), who found a curvilinear relationship between time pressure and creativity after controlling for the effects of control variables and job characteristics. </li>
<li>Hennessey and Amabile (2010) conclude that while the effects of time pressure on creativity are generally negative, creativity might be enhanced by time pressure if creators are protected from distractions, and if they feel as if they are on a mission; but contend that these situations are rare</li>
<li><b>similar conclusions on research on the impact of resource constraints; scholars argue abundance of material resources actually has a deadening effect on creativity by making creators too comfortable (Csikszentmihalyi, 1997)</b></li>
<li>not having every resource readily at hand may stretch employees to find more innovative approaches and solutions (Shalley and Gilson, 2004)</li>
<li>innovation literature has explored resource constraints in greater depth</li>
<li>recent research finds that financial resource scarcity can stimulate and facilitate innovation performance at the individual (Baker and Nelson, 2005; Garud and Karnoe, 2003), team (Hoegl et al,. 2008; Weiss et al., 2012) and organizational levels (Katila and Shane, 2005; Mishina et al., 2004; Mone et al., 1998). </li>
<li>laboratory research in marketing literature yields similar results: individuals more creative when solving problems when given fewer resources to work with (Moreau and Dahl, 2005)</li>
<li>NPD researchers explore role of team-level moderators in how financial constraints affect innovation project performance (Weiss et al., 2012)</li>

<li>recent research on group-level creativity suggests that constraints such as standardized processes and routines (e.g. institutionalized problem-solving or brainstorming methods) can positively impact creativity, given a supportive organizational environment for innovation (e.g. Hargadon and Sutton, 1996; Gilson et al., 2005)
<ul>
<li>Gilson et al. found that teams with standardized routines and practices in place, in addition to being empowered by their organization to be creative, were more creative than teams who were empowered to be creative but lacked standardization</li>
<li>creative teams have even been shown to actively place constraints on themselves as a way of structuring or bounding their work in ways that enhance their creativity (Hargadon and Sutton 1996, Stokes 2006)
<ul>
<li>theorists argue such constraints are particularly beneficial to team creativity at the early stages of the creative process (i.e. idea generation and selection), because they provide common structures, expectations, and norms for the team creative process (DeRue and Rosso 2009)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
In sum, empirical research on the impact of constraints on creativity suggests that constraints do not necessarily impede, and may even enhance creativity, depending on how they are managed and the environment in which they occur. However, there has been limited empirical work overall, and it remains unclear whether all constraints operate similarly on team creativity and under what conditions constraints will inhibit or enhance team creativity.

<h2>Findings</h2>

<br>

<h3>Types of constraints and their impact on team creativity</h3>

<br>

<p>
562
</p>

<p>
First RQ: "What are the key constraints experienced by R&amp;D teams and what impact do these have on team creativity?"<br>
<ul>
<li>goal to uncover which constraints were most salient to R&amp;D teams in this creative context, and to understand what impact various constraints had on R&amp;D team creativity
<ul>
<li>developed a typology of constraints that fall into two main categories: Process constraints and Product constraints</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
...since the extant theory and research have focused on only a very limited set of constraints, I wanted to ground my study in the R&amp;D teams' own perceptions about what they considered constraints in their projects, so as not to limit the theoretical scope of the research by entering with preconceived notions. <br>
<ul>
<li>proved to be a fruitful strategy as a broad and diverse set of constraints was revealed</li>
<li>criterion of categorizing a constraint was simply respondent's identification of something as a constraint</li>
<li>in order to be considered a core constraint, a constraint needed to be raised by half of the members of at least one of the R&amp;D teams studied
<ul>
<li>this criterion excluded 7 constraints, <b>importantly such as Technological, Regulatory, and Public health (also process legacy, manufacturing capability, organizational structure, product legacy)</b></li>
<li><span class="zim-tag">@HOXNOTE</span> such exclusion may miss "tacit" constraints!!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Resulting core constraints: (process/product, no of references)
<ul>
<li>time (Process: most salient, 30 references)</li>
<li>product requirements (Product: 2nd most salient, 18 references)</li>
<li>equipment (Process: 9 references)</li>
<li>customer and market needs (Product: 10 references)</li>
<li>business needs (Product: 12 references)</li>
<li>intellectual property (Product; 8 references)</li>
<li>human resources (Process; 8 references)</li>
<li>money (Process; 5 references)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
564
</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li>whether or not constraints were perceived as authentic:</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Such perceptions also seemed to impact how teams interpreted and responded to a constraint. Specifically, it seems time constraints must be perceived as genuine in order to impact team creativity either for better or for worse. If time constraints were perceived to be genuine, teams understood that timeframes were likely not negotiable and that they would need to organize accordingly. 
</p>

<p>
566
</p>

<p>
Although constraints posed by external customer and market needs would seem to have a negative impact on team creativity, respondents perceived them to be quite helpful, not just because they provided clarity and direction, but because they provided the sense that the team was doing important work with practical application. Without such constraints, an R&amp;D team could design extremely novel solutions that might have no utility for customers (and therefore would be a failure, from a design and a sales standpoint). On the other hand, these types of constraints can introduce complexity and ambiguity into the creative process. As one responded noted, "There's no way that you're gonna be able to 100% satisfy 100% of your users, so you constantly have to make trade-offs." By and large, however, team members found it creatively stimulating "trying to provide something for the customer that they want to use."
</p>

<p>
569
</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li>data reveals that both process and product constraints can either enhance or inhibit team creativity</li>
<li>but overall, constraints on work processes (process constraints) had more negative implications for team creativity than constraints on work outcomes (i.e. product constraints)</li>
<li>in turn, product constraints seemed to have greater potential to positive impact team creativity</li>
<li>Why?</li>
<li>seems that product and process constraints operate differently on team creativity and because they tend to be interpreted differently</li>
<li>process constraints constrain how the work is done, and therefore limit the set of possible approaches that can be taken by the team
<ul>
<li>tends to inhibit the sense of empowerment team members feel in their work, as well as how much freedom they have in the way they enact the project</li>
<li>prior research demonstrates that a lack of empowerment and autonomy reduces intrinsic motivation which inhibits creativity (Amabile 1996; Deci and Ryan, 2002)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>on the other hand, product constraints constrain the intended or expected outcomes of the project, and therefore limit the set of possible solutions to the problem
<ul>
<li>as long as these limitations are not too burdensome, it seems the team collectively benefits from the <b>focusing effect</b> of a well-defined creative challenge, while retaining the freedom to create in whichever manner they choose</li>
<li>NOTE that this is reminiscent of the way e.g. skunk works-type outfits operate</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>however, there are expcetions to these rules</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>Under What Conditions Do Constraints Inhibit or Enhance Team Creativity?</h3>

<br>

<p>
<ul>
<li>note that no account was made for the nature of technology</li>
<li>disabling and enabling dynamics</li>
</ul>
</p>

<br>

<p>
578
</p>

<h3>The role of constraint severity</h3>

<br>

<p>
<ul>
<li>perceived severity of the constraint seems to play an important role alongside team dynamics</li>
<li>moderate levels of constraint were perceived to be helpful to team creativity, but too severe constraints were perceived as harmful</li>
<li>true for process and product constraints alike</li>
<li>lack of constraints seen harmful: too broad possibilities lead to floundering</li>
<li>data suggests there is a "sweet spot" in which constraints hold the potential to enhance team creativity</li>
<li>supports prior theory and research suggesting a curvilinear effect of time constraint on creativity (e.g. Baer and Oldham 2006; Hennessey and Amabile 2010; Ohly et al., 2006; West, 2002)</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>Discussion</h2>

<br>

<p>
580
</p>

<p>
By focusing primarily on what I call process constraints (especially on limitations of time and resources), creativity researchers have privileged a mostly negative view of constraints. 
</p>

<h3>Limitations</h3>

<br>

<p>
<ul>
<li>provided for richly descriptive data</li>
<li>does not provide grounds for assumptions about causality</li>
<li>data collection over three months captured only a portion of the lifecycle of these projects</li>
<li>longitudinal studies required</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
581
</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li>other research methodologies welcome</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>Future research directions</h3>

<br>

<p>
<ul>
<li>study challenges the assumption that constraints are harmful to teams in the early stages of the creative process</li>
<li>however, none of the teams operated on the earlier stages of idea generation</li>
<li>interestingly, study found some anecdotal evidence that constraints later in the innovation chain were actually more harmful</li>
<li>one surprising insight from the study was that managers might impose artificial constraints on R&amp;D teams with the aim of motivating action or as a symbolic representation of the importance of the project
<ul>
<li>this may create a "sense of being on a mission" for the team; Hennessey and Amabile (2010) found it can stimulate creativity</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
