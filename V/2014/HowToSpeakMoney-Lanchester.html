How to speak money
</p>

<p>
”But the priests were cheating, because they had something else too: they had a Nilometer. This was a secret device made to measure and predict the level of floodwater. It consisted of a large, permanent measuring station sited on the river, with lines and markers designed to predict the level of the annual flood. The calibrations used the water level to forecast levels of harvest from Hunger up through Suffering to Happiness, Security, and Abundance, to, in a year with too much water, Disaster. Nilometers were a, perhaps the, priestly secret. They were situated in temples where only priests were granted access; the Greek historian Herodotus, who wrote the first outsider’s account of Egyptian life, in the fifth century BC, was told of their existence, but wasn’t allowed to see one. As late as 1810, thousands of years after the Nilometers had entered use, foreigners were still forbidden access to them.
</p>

<p>
”Added to accurate records of flood patterns dating back for centuries—accessible only to the priests, because only they could read and write—the Nilometer was an essential tool for control of Egypt. It had to be kept secret, because otherwise the ruling class and institutions would have given up too much of their authority.”

”Added to accurate records of flood patterns dating back for centuries—accessible only to the priests, because only they could read and write—the Nilometer was an essential tool for control of Egypt. It had to be kept secret, because otherwise the ruling class and institutions would have given up too much of their authority.<br>
The world is full of priesthoods. The Nilometer offers a perfect paradigm for many kinds of expertise, many varieties of religious and professional mystery. Many of the words for deliberately obfuscating nonsense come from priestly ritual: mumbo jumbo from the Mandinka word maamajomboo, a masked shamanic ceremonial dancer; hocus-pocus from hoc est corpus meum in the Latin mass. On the one hand, the elaborate language and ritual, designed to bamboozle and mystify and intimidate and add value; on the other, the calculations that the pros make in private. Practitioners of almost every métier, from plumbers to chefs to nurses to teachers to police, have a gap between the way they talk to each other and the way they talk to their customers or audience.”
</p>

<p>
”So this is how I think it works: As you learn to name things, you learn to taste and remember them. That might sound like a double benefit, a win-win: but there is a catch here, a potential problem. We can use our food vocabulary to talk about food with other people, to enter a dialogue with—well, with anyone; or almost anyone. This is the social aspect of food language, and it’s very powerful within the community whose members know what they are talking about. But it’s also a potential problem. The words and references are really useful only to people who’ve had the same experiences and use the same vocabulary: you’re referring to a shared basis of sensory experience and a shared language. People who don’t have those things are likely to think you are producing the thing that smells like Shiraz, and they don’t mean it as praise.”
</p>

<p>
”As your vocabulary becomes more specific, more useful, more effective, it also becomes more exclusive. You are talking to a smaller audience.<br>
The language of money works like that too. It is powerful and efficient; but it is also both exclusive and excluding. The qualities are intimately linked.”
</p>

<p>
”Hence, Kilkenomics: the world’s first-ever festival of comedy and economics, which is still running as an annual event. Every event at the festival mixes comedians together with economists. The idea behind that was brilliantly simple: what the comedians do is force the economists to stop talking entirely to each other and engage the audience instead. It was extraordinary to see how effective this was; you could see it in the body language of participants onstage. As the economists got into their stride, they would, entirely unconsciously, begin to turn towards each other and away from the audience. At that point one of the comedians would make a joke, often along the lines of not knowing what the fecking hell the economists were talking about, and everyone would laugh, and the economists would remember where they were and turn back to reengage with the audience.”
</p>

<p>
”This is where the question of the language became so important. The economists’ tendency to turn towards each other was based on the fact that they spoke the same language and could use it to communicate so effectively—so, if you’ll forgive the pun, economically. It was actually the language, the seductive power of it, that was encouraging them to talk mainly to each other. One of the events at Kilkenomics was a brilliant panel game in which two teams, both of them with one comedian and one economist, played a game in which the moderator held up a word, then the comedians guessed what it meant, before the economists gave an explanation of what it really was. It was very funny, and it also offered a real education in this issue of just how important the language of economics is.”
</p>

<p>
”The disagreements in economics aren’t just about technicalities: they’re usually based on profound divergences in moral analysis. In economics, though, the morality is buried below the surface of what you’re talking about. Morality and ethics are too basic, too fundamental to be given direct expression in economics. The language of money doesn’t express any implied moral perspective. Judgments of what’s right and wrong are left out. This can make the language seem abrasive, even shocking, to people who habitually speak a different kind of discourse. Since much of the language of public life has an implied moral and political load, this makes money-speak very distinctive. “Welfare scroungers” has a different spin from “benefit claimants,” who don’t sound at all the same as “the working poor,” even if these are all the same people, and the benefit they’re claiming is called “job seeker’s allowance,” where once it was known as “unemployment benefit” in an attempt to provide a heavy nudge (and to placate right-wing headline writers)”
</p>

<p>
”Aristotle was right when he said that man is a political animal; our language is one of the most political things about us.”
</p>

<p>
”some of the time the amorality is real, and deep, and troubling. Some of the people who speak money do genuinely not give a shit about anything other than money. They think that poor people are poor because they are lazy or stupid or weak, and that rich people are rich because they are hardworking, intelligent, and strong, and that all the evident inequalities and injustices in the world result from those unpalatable facts. But that’s interesting, in a way, no? It would be better if the people who think that actually say it, and try to argue for it. At the moment we in the English-speaking world have a political and economic direction of travel that embodies the trends towards baked-in, permanent inequality, without the conversation in which people in favor of the arrangement spell out their views.”
</p>

<br>

<p>
”In practice, Chinese walls tend to be highly permeable, especially in times of stress and/or opportunity. In other words, it is the opposite of the actual Chinese wall. In considering the financial use of the term, we would all do well to bear in mind something said by the investor Vincent Daniel, in speaking to Michael Lewis: “When I hear ‘Chinese wall,’ I think, ‘You’re a fucking liar.’ ” 2<br>
So that’s “reversification”: a term being turned into its opposite. In this case it is the pressures of capitalism that are responsible, because those forces have led to the creation of institutions that have within them different departments, which—if the system is to function without conflicts of interest— shouldn’t really be there. 
</p>

<p>
”What’s generally agreed to have been the first hedge fund developed a more sophisticated evolution of the techniques used by gamblers hedging their bets. It was the creation of the American investment manager Alfred Winslow Jones. A Fortune magazine article about Jones used the term “hedge fund” for the first time. I like the title of the piece: “The Jones Nobody Keeps Up With.”3 At the time the story came out, in 1966, his fund had just gone up 325 percent in five years”
</p>

<p>
”Jones was an interesting man, and had an interesting life. He was born in Melbourne in 1900 and moved to America at the age of four. After graduating from Harvard in 1923, he sailed around the world on a tramp steamer, then joined the US foreign service, where he served as vice consul in Berlin during Hitler’s rise to the chancellorship; then he went to the Spanish Civil War as an official observer for the Quakers; then he took a PhD in sociology at Columbia University. The subject of his thesis was class distinctions in modern American life. He turned the thesis into a book, Life, Liberty, and Property: A Story of Conflict and a Measurement of Conflicting Rights. (Quite an irony: the man who invented hedge funds was fascinated by the question of social class in America.)”
</p>

<p>
”On the basis of the book, Jones was hired as a writer by Fortune magazine, where he began to take an interest in the world of money. After the war he left Fortune to set up as a freelance writer and came across the subject of number-based forecasting. He wrote a piece about it, “Fashions in Forecasting,” in 1949. Having looked at these techniques and concluded there was something in them, he then decided, at the age of forty-eight, to establish an investment partnership designed to give them a try. He chose a partnership structure, limited to a small number of members, as a way of getting around the rules on how collective investments were regulated; he chose to pay himself 20 percent of the profits, on the basis that this was what Phoenician sea captains paid themselves after a successful voyage (no, really); he used borrowed money to magnify the impact of his choices; and his investments were hedged.”
</p>

<p>
”That’s to say, he bet on some things going up, “going long,” as it’s called, and simultaneously on other things going down, “going short.” He used mathematical techniques to try and ensure that all movements in the market would be taken account of by this mixture of long and short “positions” and produce a positive outcome, whatever happened. As the official history of the partnership states,<br>
His key insight was that a fund manager could combine two techniques: buying stocks with leverage (or margin), and selling short other stocks. Each technique was considered risky and highly speculative, but when properly combined together would result in a conservative portfolio. The realization that one could use speculative techniques to conservative ends was the most important step in forming the hedged fund. Using his knowledge of statistics from his background as a sociologist, Jones developed a measure of market and stock-specific risk to better manage the exposure of his portfolio.”
</p>

<p>
”It is important to note that Jones referred to his fund as a “Hedged Fund” not a “Hedge Fund” because he believed that being hedged was the most important identifying characteristic. Many “hedge funds” today are unregulated investment partnerships with performance compensation structures, but some of them may not actually be hedged.4”
</p>

</p>

<p>
”The classic hedge fund technique, as created by Jones, is still in use: funds employ complex mathematical analysis to bet on prices going both up and down in ways that are supposedly guaranteed to produce a positive outcome. This is “long-short,” the textbook hedge fund strategy. But as that enjoyably sniffy note from the Jones company points out, many hedge funds don’t in fact follow classic hedging strategies. As it’s used today, the term “hedge fund” means a lightly regulated pool of private capital, almost always doing something exotic—because if it wasn’t exotic, the investors could access the investment strategy much more cheaply somewhere else. There will almost always be a “secret sauce” of some sort, proprietary to the hedge fund; it is usually a complicated set of mathematical techniques. Does that sound straightforward? It shouldn’t. Most hedge funds fail: 90 percent of all the hedge funds that have ever existed have closed or gone broke.”
</p>

<p>
”Out of a total of about 9,800 hedge funds worldwide, 743 failed or closed in 2010, 775 in 2011, and 873 in 2012—so in three years, a quarter of all the funds in existence three years earlier disappeared. The overall number did not decrease, because hope springs eternal, and other new funds kept being launched at the same time.<br>
In a sense hedge funds provide a model of how capitalism should work: people risking their own money, being rewarded when they are right, and losing out when they are wrong, and none of it costing the ordinary citizen anything in bailouts or subsidies. Mind you, the sense in which they are losing “their own money” is broad, because hedge funds, ever since the days of Alfred Jones, have depended heavily on leverage, in other words on money borrowed from other people. So as long as we understand that hedge funds losing their own money includes the money of people who have lent them money, then it still holds that the only people whose money they’re risking is themselves and consenting adults. (For an explanation of the pro-hedge argument, see Sebastian Mallaby’s More Money Than God: Hedge Funds[…]”
</p>

<p>
”A hedge is a physical thing; it turned into a metaphor; then into a technique; then the technique was adopted in the world of high finance, and became more and more sophisticated and more and more complicated; then it turned into something that can’t be understood by ordinary use of the ordinary referents of ordinary language. And that is the story of how a hedge, setting limits to a field, became what it is today: a largely unregulated pool of private capital, often using enormous amounts of leverage and borrowing to multiply the size of its bets.<br>
This is reversification in its full glory. The force that has taken a simple, strong old word—“hedge”—and turned it into an entirely new thing, which is more or less the opposite of a hedge, is the force of economic innovation. It is, to put it differently, capitalism”
</p>

<p>
”These are all examples of how processes of innovation, experimentation, and progress in the techniques of finance have been brought to bear on language, so that words no longer mean what they once meant. It is not a process intended to deceive. It is not like the deliberate manufacture and concealment of a Nilometer. But the effect is much the same: it is excluding, and it confines knowledge to a priesthood—the priesthood of people who can speak money.”
</p>

<br>

”At some point in the 1840s, a French liberal thinker called Frédéric Bastiat made a trip to his capital city and had an epiphany:<br>
On entering Paris, which I had come to visit, I said to myself—here are a million human beings who would all die in a short time if provisions of every kind ceased to flow toward this great metropolis. Imagination is baffled when it tries to appreciate the vast multiplicity of commodities that must enter tomorrow through the barriers in order to preserve the inhabitants from falling a prey to the convulsions of famine, rebellion and pillage. And yet all sleep at this moment, and their peaceful slumbers are not disturbed for a single instant by the prospect of such a frightful catastrophe. On the other hand, eighty departments have been laboring today, without concert, without any mutual understanding, for the provisioning of Paris. How does each succeeding day bring what is wanted, nothing more, nothing less, to so gigantic a market?<br>
What, then, is the ingenious and secret power that governs the astonishing regularity of movements so complicated, a regularity in which everybody has implicit faith, although happiness and life itself are at stake?”

”His answer: the free market. This was a lightbulb moment for Bastiat, a glimpse of the complexity that can develop from a simple starting point”

”Bastiat (1801–1850) was a strikingly clear-minded early advocate of what came to be known as liberal economics, whose central idea is that the state should get out of the way of free trade. He would be a lot more famous if he wasn’t French, since the French are highly distrustful of the whole notion of liberal economics and tend to see it as an Anglo-American cross between a conspiracy and a mistake.”

”For one thing, it isn’t at all clear that economics actually is a science—many people in the field like the idea that it’s a science, and refer to it as a science, but that’s more a claim than a statement of fact. The conservative philosopher Michael Oakeshott wrote about the main areas of the humanities as “conversations”: poetry, history, and philosophy were conversations that humankind had had with itself, and that anyone could join in, just by paying attention and studying and thinking. Economics, it seems to me, is a conversation in that Oakeshottian sense, rather than a science like the hard physical sciences. That said, there are areas of economics that come very close to science, in which experiments are made and can be measured and repeated. These experiments are largely in the field of microeconomics, which is the study and analysis of how people behave.”

”In public life, economists are often to be found playing the role of people who explain why something is unaffordable, or why some group of people have lost their jobs, or why some other group has to work longer for less pay. But that’s an accidental manifestation of what economics really is: the study of human behavior in all its forms, and the attempt to discern principles and rules underlying the chaotic multiplicity of all the things we do. Psychology looks at people from the inside. Economics looks at them from the outside. Human beings aren’t dismal, and neither is economics.”
</p>

”I should point out that just as most economists aren’t macroeconomists, quite a lot of them have absolutely no interest in money. I don’t mean at the personal level: I mean they have no interest in money as a subject. In large parts of the discipline, or disciplines, of economics, money had come to be seen as no longer interesting at a theoretical level. Money had been solved. It was a way of keeping score of things being exchanged, but the real points of interest lay beyond and through it: it could be regarded as transparent, as safely ignorable. That seems pretty amazing now, with the benefit of hindsight, when we have seen a convulsion inside the function of money that took the entire global financial system to the edge of the abyss, with consequences that are bitterly present in many of our lives more than half a decade later. You could even say that large parts of the economic profession resembled the British defenses at Singapore, with their guns pointed in the wrong direction.”

”There are sometimes arguments in science about whether specific breakthroughs are better defined as discoveries or as inventions: are the findings of mathematics discoveries of entities that preexist, or are they creations of the human imagination? Or both? Money is like that too. Did we invent it, or is it somehow inherent in transactions between people—implying that there is a “moneyness” in exchanges, which money then abstracts and turns into an exchangeable thing-in-itself? (The popularity of this view was one of the reasons many economists had stopped being interested in money: the transactions were more interesting than the tool through which they were transacted.)”

”The trouble with this account is that there is absolutely no evidence for its ever having occurred. In real-life examples from anthropology, it looks as if credit in reality comes first: people agree to exchange goods and services on a credit basis even in the most “primitive” societies, long preceding the invention of money.6 Credit isn’t that complicated an idea for us humans: we get it. The interwoven, interdependent nature of our existence makes us very quick to understand the circulating reciprocalities involved in the idea of credit. We invent money afterwards, for trading with people outside the circles we already know. As for barter, which is where the whole notion of money is supposed to have come from: it’s vastly less common. The standard economic account of the invention of money has no evidence to back it up in the historical or anthropological record.”

”Modern money is mainly an act of faith—an act of credit, of belief.<br>
One of the lessons of the credit crunch was that this credit, this belief, can be vulnerable. A moment came when it wasn’t clear, even to people at the heart of the system—the high priesthood of money itself—that the ones and zeros were worth what they were supposed to be worth. If people and companies couldn’t pay their debts, then all the accumulated credits in the financial system weren’t worth their nominal value; and if that was the case, then, as George W. Bush so eloquently put it, “this sucker could go down.” Even after the financial system recovered from its near-death experience, it has proved hard to forget that moment of noncredit, and to let go of that sense of appalled wonder.”
</p>

<p>
”Andy Haldane, director of stability at the Bank of England (great job title: perhaps each and every one of us should have a personal director of stability), made a study of modern derivative transactions and found that some of them involve up to a billion lines of computer code. That is beyond comprehension, not in a metaphorical way, but as a plain fact: no human can understand and parse a financial instrument of that complexity. None of us really understands how the labor of humans and the movement of goods and exchange of services can be turned into purely financial transactions that involve a “black box” financial instrument a billion lines long. We just have to take it on credit.”
</p>

<br>

<p>
”One of the best books written about money is a history of it by the economist and economic historian John Kenneth Galbraith. It begins with a wonderfully bracing line: “The reader should proceed in these pages in the knowledge that money is nothing more or less than what he or she always thought it was—what is commonly offered or received for the purchase or sale of goods, services, or other things.”7 That, by refusing to engage with the problem, is a potent acknowledgment of its scale. In effect the great man is saying, “Money? I’ve no idea what that stuff really is.”
</p>

<br>

<p>
”This, I think, is an important part of what is interesting about the language of money, and about the field of economics, and maybe even about people. There’s so much we don’t know, not just on a superficial level but at the deepest levels too. That is why the language is so useful, and so important: it delineates the thing we’re talking about, in order to leave us clear to agree or disagree, to make up our minds or to fail to make them up, and come to the conclusion that while we can see the problem, we don’t entirely know what we think about it.”
</p>

<br>

”The subject under discussion, economics, purports to be a science. It is an extremely well-staffed and well-funded field of study, employing tens of thousands of people in both the private and the public sectors; it has extensive experience of precedents and an incomparably greater amount of data than was available to any previous students of economic problems.§ And yet, as Anatole Kaletsky wrote in the London Times on 4 April 2013, all the main questions remain open:<br>
In a recession, should governments reduce budget deficits or increase them? Do zero-interest rates stimulate economic recovery or suppress it? Should welfare benefits be maintained or cut in response to high unemployment? Should depositors in failed banks be protected or face big losses? Does economic inequality damage or encourage economic growth? . . . What all these important questions have in common is that economists cannot answer them.
</p>

<p>
This is an amazing state of affairs. For some, it is the moment to give up on economics as a discipline, to throw up the hands and announce that the whole subject is bollix. 
</p>

<p>
”§ This point is a bigger deal than one might think. I’ve already mentioned Alfred Marshall once, and will be coming back to him shortly, but he’s relevant in this context too, because his attempt to found the subject of economics on a mathematical and empirical basis involved an enormous amount of work simply to gather data. Today there’s an astounding amount of data freely available over the Internet to anyone who’s interested. Marshall and other early economists spent thousands of hours working to get hold of facts that are now accessible in minutes to anyone with a network connection.”
</p>

<p>
”This impulse is easy to understand, and has given birth to some good polemics, such as Steve Keen’s Debunking Economics: The Naked Emperor of the Social Sciences. And indeed, there are times when faced by an institutional arrogance among some economists—a semi-autistic refusal to see the human context of their own subject, a blindness to their own shortcomings and the limits to their own knowledge—when it’s tempting to go along with the refuseniks. But it’s more tempting still, I would suggest, to swap perspectives on the question. The lack of definitive conclusions isn’t a weakness in the field; it’s what’s interesting about it. The chaotic lack of consensus arises because economics is “the study of mankind in the ordinary business of life.” When is anyone going to reach any final verdicts about that?”
</p>

”The nature of the difficulty was touched on by Keynes, quoting a remark made to him by Max Planck, the German scientist and theoretician who made the intellectual breakthrough that led to the birth of quantum physics. That means Planck was one of the most brilliant mathematician-physicists the world has ever seen.<br>
Professor Planck of Berlin, the famous originator of the Quantum Theory, once remarked to me that in early life he had thought of studying economics, but had found it too difficult! Professor Planck could easily master the whole corpus of mathematical economics in a few days. He did not mean that! But the amalgam of logic and intuition and the wide knowledge of facts, most of which are not precise, which is required for economic interpretation in its highest form, is, quite truly, overwhelmingly difficult for those whose gift mainly consists in the power to imagine and pursue to their furthest points the implications and prior conditions of comparatively simple facts which are known with a high degree of precision.8”

”Keynes’s point—which was also Planck’s point—is that in economics, the mathematics can’t be relied on to do all the work. The “amalgam of logic and intuition and the wide knowledge of facts, most of which are not precise,” makes the field one requiring an unusual mix of aptitudes. This of course is what is fascinating about it: the fact that its complexity derives from the variety of human lives. We’re not simple, so why should economics be?”
</p>

<br>

<p>
”At this stage, the question arises: if economics and money-stuff is so inherently interesting, why do people hate it so much? Why does the field feel so alienating to outsiders? The answer I think is to do with a wrong turn taken by a particular segment of the economic profession, and the way that turn helped contribute to both the crisis of 2008 and the Great Recession that followed. There are two main contributing factors to the wrong turn: one of them is a tendency in the field, an apparently built-in bias towards a specific intellectual mistake; the other is the grip of one particular subspecies of economics, calcified into a narrow view of how markets and societies must function.”
