<p>
- explores the role and relevance of resource scarcity in product innovation<br>
- literature tends to assume that the development of new products requires resource sufficiency for the process to be conducted systematically<br>
- however, also that necessity is the mother of innovation and that resource scarcity may trigger innovation in adverse contexts<br>
- organises the literature on product innovation in resource-poor contexts in three streams
</p>

<p>
202
</p>

<p>
- explores three forms of scarcity influence in product innovation process:<br>
<ol type="1" start="1">
<li>lack of time</li>
<li>lack of material resources</li>
<li>lack of affluent customers</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
- assumes scarcity as central to social sciences<br>
- approach/assumptions exemplified: that scarcity is operating with "tighter economic resources ... rather than with the resources that would have been considered adequate under different or ideal economic circumstances."<br>
- does note that "Product innovation often takes place in the absence of appropriate conditions. Entrepreneurial product innovation, for instance, tends to occur in environments characterized by severe and persistent resource constraints (Baker and Nelson, 2005), and product innovation in mature firms may also suffer from the lack of what product innovators see as the adequate and necessary materials (Larson and Gobeli, 1989), namely in terms of material resources, time, and affluent buyers. 
</p>

<p>
203
</p>

<p>
Product innovation in resource-poor environments is as old as creativity itself, but as an academic field it is nascent and immature.
</p>

<p>
- searched following key words in Topic or Abstract fields:<br>
- "improvisation" AND "product innovation" OR "new product development" (48 papers)<br>
- "bricolage" AND "product innovation" OR "new product development" (3 papers)<br>
- "frugal innovation" AND "product innovation" OR "new product development" (1 paper=<br>
- "base of the pyramid" OR "bottom of the pyramid" AND "product innovation" OR "new product development" (4 papers)<br>
- accounting for duplicates, this yielded 53 papers<br>
- next search for papers whose title included key words "improvisation" or "bricolage" or "frugal innovation" or "base of the pyramid" or "bottom of the pyramid"
</p>

<p>
- total yielded 64 articles<br>
- considered 3 criteria: the outlet of publication, the explicitness of their focus on the topic, and their presence in the references of other papers on the topic
</p>

<p>
- three research streams: bricolage, improvisation, frugal innovation
</p>

<p>
Bricolage: Product Innovation When Material Resources Are Scarce
</p>

<p>
Under bricolage, scarcity is seen as opportunity, but only for those who can enact the potentiality "contained" in surrounding dormant resources. 
</p>

<p>
- creative resource bundling
</p>

<p>
204
</p>

<p>
The activities of bricolage occur when people explore existing resources in novel ways, not necessarily under time pressure as in the case of improvisation. As Baker and Nelson (2005) pointed out, a bricolage approach involves "a bias for testing received limitations." 
</p>

<p>
Improvisation: Product Innovation When Time Is Scarce
</p>

<p>
Under improvisation, scarcity is seen as a threat, but not an immutable fact. Instead, because scarcity is enacted, companies are able to draw on available resources to generate solutions. ... Improvisational innovation occurs when there is time pressure, in the sense that planning and execution cannot be separated. It consists of responding to product innovation opportunities in the face of limited windows of opportunity and possibly with less than adequate resources. 
</p>

<p>
HOXNOTE: But when can we say it's about improvisation and when it's just business as usual?
</p>

<p>
204<br>
When facing unexpected and pressing issues, product innovators may need to improvise solutions, which means that they have to act deliberately and unexpectedly (Moorman and Miner, 1998) and resort to whatever materials they have, precisely because there is no time to search for the otherwise preferred resources...
</p>

<p>
205
</p>

<p>
...
</p>

<p>
The improvisational process occurs when companies competing in fast-changing markets find themselves time-pressed by some unexpected event. If they have a structure that favors rapid response, namely a minimal structure and simple rules (Davis, Eisenhardt, and Bingham 2009), they will respond by improvising. Improvisation is aform of action that combines strong elements of control with ample freedom. The control and predictability components come from goals, clear deadlines, well-defined responsibilities, and a "collective mind" (Brady, 2011); freedom results in accountability and presonal initiative, with extensive communication replacing detailed rules and protocols. 
</p>

<p>
206
</p>

<p>
Frugal Innovation: Product Innovation When Affluent Customers Are Scarce
</p>

<p>
For frugal innovators, scarcity is both fact (they cannot easily change the economic condition of their potential customers) and an opportunity. Companies able to reimagine their relationship with their customers via product innovations will potentially tap hidden markets. Frugal innovation refers to an "overarching philosophy that enables a true 'clean sheet' approach to product development. Cost discipline is an intrinsic part of the process, but rather than simply cutting costs, frugal engineering seeks to avoid needless costs in the first place" (Sehgal, Dehoff, and Panneer, 2010, p. 20). 
</p>

<p>
...
</p>

<p>
Empirical work on frugal innovation is practically nonexistent, and the pioneering publications are often case studies and papers coauthored by academics and executives from companies that have adopted some kind of frugal innovation, in a demonstration that the academic world is still making sense of developments in innovation in peripheral, emerging economies. Work on frugal innovation is mainly linked with innovations taking place in the Indian subcontinent (Elaydi and Harrison, 2010; Simanis and Hart, 2009). It does not come as a surprise that the stream is basically still atheoretical and that there is significant space for developing this topic, especially given the growing interest for emerging markets in acontext of globalization. The economic stagnation of Western markets, coupled with the dynamism of some emerging economies, also helps to justify increased attention to frugal innovation. 
</p>

<p>
207
</p>

<p>
We contribute to the literature on product innovation in three main ways. First, we advance nontraditional views on product innovation that may be relevant for the case of resource-poor contexts. Most product innovation models rely on uncertainty reduction processes that do not accommodate scarcity. However, as we discussed, this may be a crucial variable in many product innovation attempts. 
</p>

<p>
Second, we accenuate the fact that different sources of product innovation advantage may be found in different dimensions of scarcity. Unused resources or resources considered worthless by some organizations (e.g. commercial firms) may be valued and appreciated by other organizations (e.g. social enterprises)... Time pressure may be a source of acceleration and temporal advantage. ...
</p>

<p>
Third, we systematized work on resource-constrained product innovation. The literatures are still limited, nonarticulated, and at different stages of evolution. The bricolage stream is now seeing its initial steps and gaining autonomy from improvisational research. The improvisational stream has alteary produced some important studies that help to uncover how organizations may react in a speedy way to important events. The frugal innovation stream is popular but still limited to anectdotal evidence and dissection of company practices. <br>
We conclude that the history of product innovation in resource-poor contexts is still short, but that the future is promising, given the need of organizations to deal with <br>
208<br>
resource constraints and conditions of scarcity in the face of economic downturns, ultrarapid competition, attempts to reach the poor, the pursuit of growth in emerging markets, and new pressures for developing ecologically friendly new products.
</p>

<p>
...
</p>

<p>
Limitations and boundary conditions
</p>

<p>
- obvious limitation: small quantity of research published on the topic<br>
- authors nevertheless consider the topic is important enough to deserve the effort
</p>

<p>
...it is necessary to specify the scarcity conditions that facilitate product innovation. The first test to a theory of product innovation in resource-poor contexts is to explore *when* it is that resource constraints might influence product innovation positively. To what extent may the lack of slack increase political behaviors that will impair the capacity to maintain a productive flux of product innovation? This may be an especially important matter in complex, multiteam innovation procets (Hoegl, Weinkauf, and Gemuenden, 2004), where competition for resources may  occur. Slack has been associated with better innovation performance (Daniel, Lohrke, Fornaciari, and Turner, 2004). But, in resource-poor environments, agents may consider that the risks of scarcity make political action aless tempting solution than in moermunificent environments. The specificity of penurious environments may actually help to study whether<br>
209<br>
the relationship between slack and innovation is contingent upon resource munificence. High levels of organizational preparedness and low slack in penurious environments may produce results that do not replicate findings in other organizational contexts, with scarcity neutralizing the political activity associated with no slack (Bourgeois, 1981).
