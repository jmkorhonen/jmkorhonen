Munévar, G. (2014). Space exploration and human survival. <i>Space Policy</i>, 30(4), 197–201. doi:10.1016/j.spacepol.2014.10.002
</p>

<br>

<p>
- considers several criticism to the idea that we should engage in large-scale space exploration and colonization
</p>

<p>
197
</p>

<p>
<ol type="A" start="8">
<li>G. Wells said once that our choice is the universe or nothing (1). He meant that failure to move into the cosmos would condemn us to oblivion. </li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
- philosophers have questioned whether human survival should be a value<br>
- others oppose big science on ideological grounds<br>
- Wendell Berry argues that the abundance of resources in space will produce bad character, for good character requires the discipline of finitude
</p>

<br>

<p>
199<br>
- argues that in the absence of convincing account of circumstances where the survival of humankind is less important than some other goal, the appeal to human survival provides a compelling moral reason for choosing space<br>
- problem: "humanity" is too elusive a subject to have interests; but this objection is less powerful than some imagine. <br>
- even the present generation does decide for humankind, whether unwittingly or not
</p>

<p>
Survival of the species is not a value just because it accords with evolution. In the first place such survival is not "the goal" of evolution. Evolution has no goals. And most species that ever lived are now extinct. Survival is a value to us because without it all the other interests of the species may become moot. And even though the interests of many individuals do not depend on the long-term survival of the species, the realization that certain collective actions may affect the well-being of the species as a whole makes them care how it all comes out in the wash. 
</p>

<p>
200
</p>

<p>
- argues that we have a positive obligation to put in place space systems to warn us of asteroid impacts and to deflect them, lest our descendants go the way of the dinosaurs; in a same way that we have obligations to ensure that CFCs no longer destroy the ozone layer, or to ensure that buildup of chemicals in a water tank will not reach critical mass and kill newborns in ten or twenty years (a counter to the argument that unborn generations do not have rights as they are not "real" and hence we cannot be said to have obligations towards them)
</p>

<p>
...the appropriate time to recognize the interests of the speies is when we become aware that they are threatened. And in any event, insofar as we accept the responsibility of deciding for the species, the argument that ought to work is that which takes the interests of the species into account. 
</p>

<p>
...the ideological critics may doubt the connection between space exploration and survival. I would like to consider two possible ways in which such doubts may be defended. What both alternatives have in common is the notion that the scientific approaches that would presumably save us from cosmic catastropes in the long run will instead degrade the one habitat we know for certain is ours to the point that extinction will become far more probable. 
</p>

<p>
NOTE: not very good debate
</p>

<p>
The second alternative is that we better protect the Earth by nurturing respect toward it than by letting people think that we can always move onto another nest. <br>
...<br>
- but there is no "balance" where we could live in harmony with nature forever and ever; the balances are temporary artifacts of Earth-system,and only seem to be balances to us as our individual timespans are so short
</p>

<p>
The fact of the matter is that life has often created new opportunities for itself, unwittingly no doubt, and has always changed the balance between its different forms -- most of which are now extinct. The biota of the planet has remade itself many times over. The natural balance of the ideological critics is merely a fiction, a temporary arrangement that would change even if there were no human beings around to mess things up. And surely life does not exhaust the range of natural causes that have grought about massive disruptions of balance. Do volcanic eruptions, droughts, and asteroids always make for small reversible changes? What may we say, incidentally, of the galactic disruption that forced the collapse of the pre-solar cloud into a planetary system? Of the earlier obliteration of what may have looked like states of cosmic equilibrium, and thus of natural balance? Which balance is it that we are morally obliged to restore?
</p>

<p>
201
</p>

<p>
R.C. Lewontin, S. Rose and L.J. Kamin point out:
</p>

<p>
"...all living beings both destroy and create the resources of their own continued life. As plants grow, their roots alter the soil chemically and physically. The growth of white pines creates an environment that makes it impossible for a new generation of pine seedlings to grow up, so hardwoods replace them. Animals consume the available food and foul the land and water with their excreta. But some plants fix nitrogen, providing their own resources; people farm; and beavers build dams to create their own habitat." (note 19)
</p>

<p>
The issue iis not, then, one of disrupting balance and interfering with the environment. Perfect balance can be found only right before the birth of the universe and perhaps right after its death. Even then we do not really know. And to avoid interfering with nature would be out of character for living things, while impossible to achieve anyway. The issue is rather one of interfering wisely, and of preserving (approximately) certain temporary balances that offer the best compromises for a worthwhile existence on this planet. But how are we going to achieve these goals without the kind of global and long-term knowledge that, as I have argued elsewhere, requires the scientific exploration of space? (note 20)
</p>

<p>
- notes that space exploration will not play a significant role in the reduction of Earth's population for a long time
</p>

<p>
...let us remember that in the long run the workings of nature, if we do nothing about them, are bound to create first a most unpleasant world for our descendants and then bring extinction upon them. Having science is no guarantee that those disasters will not happen. We cannot be assured that the desired level of knowledge is possible within whatever time limits infringe on our future. Nor can we be certain that just because we have that knowledge we will choose according to the best interests of the species. But we can be sure that without the global knowledge that requires space science we will simply have no choice to make. Our descendants will suffer for it; and eventually our species will disappear at the earliest cosmic inconvenience.
</p>

<p>
A species full of self-hatred may well choose such a path. But is the appeal of presumed atonoement the most fitting coice for us to make? That ascetic choice may buy us a bit of time, but for what? In the long run it leads us straight into a mass grave. The other choice, the one that really lets nature run its course offers the opportunities for expansion and diversification that so far life has been fortunate to procure for itself. It is the choice that really lets nature run its course because it recognizes that we, too, are part of nature. There is no question in my mind that in this case the way of nature has the potential for greater wisdom. 
</p>

<br>

<p>
- H. G. Wells (note 22): <br>
"Life, for ever dying to be born afresh, for ever young and eager, will presently stand upon this earth as upon a footstool, and stretch out its realm amidst the stars."
