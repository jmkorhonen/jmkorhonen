The Decline and Rise of Democracy
</p>

<p>
I have been researching and writing on this subject for twenty years, particularly by working on the long evolution of representative institutions in Europe. In recent years I began to think more explicitly about comparing world regions. Why, I asked, has Europe followed a fundamentally different political trajectory from China or the Middle East? While many scholars have written about the economic divergence that saw Europe become the first region to industrialize, fewer people have tried to explain the great political divergence.
</p>

<p>
in pursuing it we will need to consider not only democracy but also the logic of autocracy—the opposite form of governance.<br>
 As we consider a broad range of human societies, it will turn out that events in “out of the way” places and at distant times can sometimes tell us surprising things about our own political institutions of today. Democracy often thrived in places where we would least expect it. As part of this, we will learn that the story of democracy has not only been one of great thinkers writing great books; it has also been constructed by ordinary people working pragmatically to govern themselves in a collective fashion.
</p>

<p>
The democracy we have today is but one potential way of organizing things, and in closing I will suggest that once we recognize this, we will be in a better position to consider how it might evolve in the future.
</p>

<p>
One problem with this story is that when Europeans began conquering peoples on other continents, they sometimes found that local people had political institutions that were more democratic than what they knew in their home countries. In North America, as French Jesuit missionaries entered the territory of the people they called the Huron, they discovered a political system based on both central and local councils with broad participation—including for women. In the year 1636 one missionary commented that the Huron central council was like the “Estates General” of the country.1 His home country of France also had an Estates General, but it had not met for over twenty years,
</p>

<p>
In Mesoamerica, Spanish conquerors more commonly encountered societies with hierarchical political systems—but not always. In 1519 as Hernán Cortés entered the territory of Tlaxcala he observed that as far as he could judge, the form of government was “almost like that of Venice, or Genoa, or Pisa, because there is no one supreme ruler.”2 His home country of Spain had such a single supreme ruler, King Charles
</p>

<p>
Throughout human history many societies on multiple continents have independently developed political systems in which those who rule have been obliged to seek consent from those they govern. If we see seeking consent as a basic ingredient of democracy, then we can say that democracy itself occurs naturally among humans, even if it is far from inevitable.
</p>

<p>
The other question we need to ask is if early forms of democracy existed in many regions, then why did modern democracy—the selection of representatives through universal suffrage—emerge first in Europe and the United States? The answer, I will argue, has to do with the particular trajectory taken by Europe when compared with regions such as China and the Middle East. Ironically, it was Europe’s backwardness that laid the ground for the rise of modern democracy.
</p>

<p>
more literally that the people have power.
</p>

<p>
In the middle of the twentieth century, one scholar described the indigenous societies of southern Africa as having a “peculiar type of democracy.”4 Free election of leaders was unknown, but tribal chiefs had to rule collectively with assemblies and councils that constrained their actions: the people, or a subset of them, participated in governance. Rather than calling this system “peculiar,” I will call it “early democracy.” This term is useful because early democracy differed from the modern form of democracy that we are familiar with
</p>

<p>
Early democracy existed in lieu of a state bureaucracy. It was a system in which a ruler governed jointly with a council or assembly composed of members of society who were themselves independent from the ruler and not subject
</p>

<p>
They provided information while also assisting with governance. In some early democracies rulers were selected by a council; in others heredity played the primary role. Some councils in early democracies involved broad participation by the community, but it was on other occasions a more elite gathering. For those who had the right, participation took a deep and frequent form.
</p>

<p>
Early democracy was so common in all regions of the globe that we should see it as a naturally occurring condition in human societies. I am not the first person to say something like this, but I will try to provide a new and more comprehensive view of this idea while also showing when and why early democracy prevailed.5 Athens, as well as many other democracies in ancient Greece, presents us with the most extensive example of early democracy, but there have been many other societies elsewhere
</p>

<p>
Examples of early democracy include those among the Huron and in Tlaxcala to which I have already referred. We will also see examples from ancient Mesopotamia, precolonial Central Africa, ancient India, and elsewhere.
</p>

<p>
Modern democracy differs from early democracy in several important ways. It is a political system in which representatives are chosen in competitive elections under universal suffrage. With universal adult suffrage, political participation is very broad, but in modern democracy popular participation in governance is also more episodic than in early democracy. Representatives meet frequently to engage in governance, but the broader populace does not participate directly, apart from at election time.
</p>

<p>
it can produce citizen distrust and disengagement; there must be continual efforts to overcome this problem. The second fracture point of modern democracy is that it coexists with a state bureaucracy that manages day-to-day affairs, and the risk of this is that the people may no longer believe that they themselves are governing. This will be less likely to occur if democratic practices emerge before the creation of a state bureaucracy—then rulers and the people can build a bureaucracy jointly. But if bureaucracy comes first, this is less likely to happen, and this means that bureaucracy can either substitute for or complement modern democracy. It all depends on the sequence of events.
</p>

<p>
If early democracy arose independently in many human societies, modern democracy is a more specifically European invention.
</p>

<p>
Modern democracy is something much more recent, and we should think of it as an ongoing experiment. To understand when and why this experiment will succeed, we need to first consider how both early and modern democracy emerged.
</p>

<br>

<p>
 Origins of Early
</p>

<p>
All rulers—both democratic and autocratic—need at least tacit consent from their people by not revolting, but consent in early democracy was not tacit: it was active.6 
</p>

<p>
Three underlying factors helped lead to early democracy. It was first of all more prevalent in small-scale settings. We see this whether we speak of polities in Europe, in precolonial Africa, or in North America prior to European conquest. Small scale made it possible for members of a society to regularly attend the councils and assemblies that were the lifeblood of early democracy. In some early democracies having a system of representation helped confront this problem of scale: instead of having all attend, choose one person. But individual representatives still needed to travel to an assembly, and constituents still needed to monitor them once they were there,
</p>

<p>
The second factor that led to early democracy was when rulers lacked knowledge of what people were producing.9 This gave them an incentive to share power to better know what sort of taxes they could levy. We should think of “taxation” in broad terms here—the problem was faced by any ruler who sought to appropriate or redistribute economic resources. Features of the natural environment sometimes drove uncertainty, as they made agricultural production harder to predict.10 In other cases, rulers faced uncertainty because they lacked a state bureaucracy that could measure and assess production. Throughout history, uncertainty of this sort has been a great problem in taxation for rulers.
</p>

<p>
The third factor that led to early democracy involved the balance between how much rulers needed their people and how much people could do without their rulers. When rulers had a greater need for revenue, they were more likely to accept governing in a collaborative fashion, and this was even more likely if they needed people to fight wars. With inadequate means of simply compelling people to fight, rulers offered them political rights. The flip side of all this was that whenever the populace found it easier to do without a particular ruler—say by moving to a new location—then rulers felt compelled to govern more consensually. The idea that exit options influence hierarchy is, in fact, so general
</p>

<p>
also applies to species other than humans. Among species as diverse as ants, birds, and wasps, social organization tends to be less hierarchical when the costs of what biologists call “dispersal” are low.11<br>
 Over time, early democracy persisted in
</p>

<p>
it died out in many others. It did so as societies grew in scale; it also did so as rulers acquired new ways of monitoring production; it did so finally when people found it hard to exit to new areas.
</p>

<p>
Those familiar with classical Greek thought may fear that my definition of early democracy is an overly broad one.
</p>

<p>
for them the word demokratia was only associated with rule by the many, typically in a large assembly.12 Rule by the few was oligarchy, and it took place in the form of a council with limited participation. Even if governance under oligarchy had a collective air to it, this was not democracy as the Greeks would have understood it. Scholars have used the assembly versus council division to distinguish empirically between democracies and oligarchies.13
</p>

<p>
why do I adopt a definition of early democracy that the Greeks would have seen as including both democracies and oligarchies? I do this because many human societies that at first blush appear to have had rule by the few also had participation by the many. 
</p>

<p>
Among the Huron, only chiefs attended central councils, but they would face another council in their home village. In other societies the few would ordinarily make decisions, but on other occasions there was much broader discussion and consultation.14 This was the case in the towns of the Mesopotamian kingdom of Mari.
</p>

<p>
Those who have catalogued the political regimes of Greek cities have found many examples of mixed constitutions, and they have also attested to the fact that it is often difficult to classify a polis as clearly oligarchic versus clearly democratic—almost every Greek polis had some elements of these two regimes.
</p>

<p>
To me all this sounds as if the barrier between oligarchy and democracy was a very porous one.
</p>

<br>

<p>
Autocracy was the alternative to early democracy. Since it is impossible in almost any society for someone to truly rule on their own, successful autocracy was aided by the construction of a state bureaucracy. Rather than rely on members of society to help provide information and collect revenue, autocrats created bureaucracies
</p>

<p>
they themselves had selected and they themselves controlled. This was fundamentally different from relying on a council or assembly composed of members of society not subject to the ruler’s whim. Bureaucrats could be sent out to assess what people were producing and how much they could be taxed, and they could also collect the taxes. They could also be used to enforce a system of conscription without having to give people political rights. Behind all this lay the reality of military force—autocrats needed to hire and pay specialists in violence. Some of the autocracies I will consider were very efficient and others much less so, but in all cases, they were a clear alternative to early democracy.
</p>

<p>
Opting for the autocratic alternative also depended on the mastery of techniques generally associated with civilization. The most important of these was having a system of writing
</p>

<p>
Opting for the autocratic alternative depended not only on the presence of writing but also on other elements of civilization. An understanding of geometry helped with surveying fields for tax purposes; an understanding of the soil allowed state officials to classify land according to how fertile it was and to levy differential tax rates on this basis.
</p>

<p>
The paradox of civilization’s advance was that it made autocracy function more effectively.<br>
 The practice of intensive agriculture was another factor that helped facilitate the bureaucratic alternative by making the landscape more legible. The word “intensive” here refers to efforts to generate higher yields from the same amount of land through increased human effort and increased capital.18

 The practice of intensive agriculture was another factor that helped facilitate the bureaucratic alternative by making the landscape more legible. The word “intensive” here refers to efforts to generate higher yields from the same amount of land through increased human effort and increased capital.18 If we believe that bureaucrats will generally have less information than local people about production, any process that makes production more legible to outsiders—to use the term favored by James Scott—will make it easier for bureaucrats to operate.19 Intensive agriculture often does this by reordering the landscape to make production more systematic and also often more compact.
</p>

<p>
Ultimately, many autocrats who exercised the bureaucratic alternative were able to do so not because they created a state bureaucracy but because they inherited a bureaucracy from those who preceded them. Max Weber wrote that bureaucracy is “among those social structures which are the hardest to destroy.”20 In China and the Middle East we will see cases where a bureaucracy endured even in the face of massive dislocations. There may also be a corollary to Weber’s claim: once a bureaucracy is destroyed it is hard to rebuild one from scratch. This is the problem that the Carolingians and other
</p>

<p>
Why Europe Was Different<br>
 The development of early democracy was hardly unique to Europe. The assemblies of classical Greece, the gatherings of the Germanic tribes, and the councils of medieval city-states all bear certain strong resemblances to collective governance as it occurred in other world regions. But Europe was different in several crucial ways. Unlike what happened in China and the Middle East, early democracy continued to survive and thrive in Europe rather than being fully supplanted by autocratic and bureaucratic rule. This is a first development we need to consider. Europeans were also different because they eventually succeeded in scaling up the practice
</p>

<p>
We need to ask how medieval Europeans developed a practice of political representation and how this eventually gave way to the selection of leaders by free elections with universal adult suffrage.<br>
 The irony of early democracy in Europe is that it thrived and prospered precisely because European rulers for a very long time were remarkably weak.21 For more than a millennium after the fall of Rome, European rulers lacked the ability to assess what their people were producing and to levy substantial taxes based on this.22 The most striking way to illustrate European weakness is to show how little revenue they collected. Europeans would eventually develop strong systems of revenue collection, but it took them an awfully long time to do so.
</p>

<p>
To see Europe’s early weakness, consider the evidence in Figure 1.1 that shows estimates of state revenue as a share of total economic production in four societies: China under the Song dynasty in 1086 CE, Iraq under the Abbasid Caliphate in 850 CE, and England and France circa 1300 CE.23 Song emperors and Abbasid caliphs were able to extract upwards of ten times the revenue relative to GDP that could be extracted by European rulers.

For a very long time Europe’s rulers were in a weak position because they lacked state bureaucracies. They did not dispose of many of the technologies for making a bureaucracy work, and the Romans did not bequeath this institution to them.
</p>

<p>
Contributing to all this was the fact that the form of agriculture practiced in Europe—which was extensive rather than intensive—made it more difficult for bureaucracy to operate. European states would, eventually, develop strong state bureaucracies, in large part due to external threats, but by the time this happened democratic practices had become very firmly anchored, and they had also been scaled up to operate in large polities. With this sequence, bureaucracy did not substitute for democracy—as in the autocratic alternative—it instead became a complement.
</p>

<br>

<p>
still had a permanent central bureaucracy of only a few dozen individuals, and he lacked permanent military force. Absent this, Philip’s biographer Joseph Strayer argued that Philip had to attain his objectives through means other than the threat of force because “he had little force on which to rely.”24 Philip’s reign would resemble a litany of negotiations with various local groups—in dispersed order—to obtain consent for and assistance with raising revenues.25

<p>
dynasties all emerged in the Loess Plateau. Loess is a type of soil that is soft, making it easy to work with even simple tools, and it is also very porous, ensuring that any water will be delivered to growing plants. Where there was also a source of water, loess soil provided an excellent basis for early agriculture. Loess soil is also present in Europe, and western Europe’s first farmers, the Linearbandkeramik (LBK) culture, grew crops on loess soil. But in western Europe loess tended to be deposited in small scattered areas rather than across a giant plain, leading to a more dispersed pattern of early settlement. This may also have led to a longer-term trend toward dispersed political authority.

<p>
One way of interpreting what happened next in Arabia is that the arrival of Islam fatally undermined democratic prospects, but this view does not fit the history very well. Hints of governance under Muhammad himself suggest that he operated in a consultative manner for the same reasons that other Arabian rulers had: this was the only way to make things work. The text commonly known as the Constitution of Medina provides one way to see 
</p>

<p>
It was the swift inheritance of a preexisting state—not Islam—that led to the demise of early democracy in the Middle East. As the Islamic conquerors spread outward from Arabia, they soon encountered more densely populated lands where people practiced an intensive and settled form of agriculture, a radically different environment from Arabia. In the territory that is now Iraq these lands were part of the Sasanian Empire, and in the century or so before the Islamic conquests the Sasanians had succeeded in creating a centralized bureaucracy to collect taxes from a fertile agricultural region
</p>

<p>
Swift geographical expansion was the other factor that undermined democracy in the Middle East. Early democracy in pre-Islamic Arabia, as in many other human societies, was a small-scale, face-to-face affair; elders from individual tribal groups would assemble, discuss, and reach some sort of a conclusion. The process was an informal one, precisely because the circumstances allowed for informality. With the Islamic conquests, the question was posed of how to govern not in a face-to-face setting but instead across distances
</p>

<p>
Some scholars have suggested that in this situation what was needed was the practice eventually adopted by Europeans: a form of political representation that could allow for democratic governance over large distances.27 But Europeans took centuries of trial and error to arrive at this solution; the inhabitants of the Islamic world would have needed to figure this out within a matter of decades.
</p>

<br>

<p>
contingency played a large role here. Muslim conquerors were able to inherit a bureaucratic state because Sasanian rulers in Iraq had recently constructed one. Had the Islamic expansion happened one hundred years earlier—so in the sixth rather than the seventh century—there would have
</p>

<p>
Modern democracy is a form of rule where political participation is broad but episodic: citizens participate by voting for representatives, but this occurs only at certain intervals, and there are few means of control other than the vote—representatives cannot be bound by mandates or instructions.28 All of this contrasts with early democracy.
</p>

<p>
 was also the case that those who chose representatives could bind them with mandates, and individual localities could either veto central decisions or opt out of them. This created substantial blocking power and therefore a need for consensus. For this reason, there was less of a problem of “tyranny of the majority,” whereas this is an issue with which all modern democracies 
</p>

<p>
 continental Europe assemblies functioned in a manner seen in early democracies elsewhere: deputies were often bound by strict mandates, and local constituencies had the latitude to refuse central decisions. This was not so different from the way the Huron of the Northeastern Woodlands governed themselves, and those continental European rulers who attempted to deviate from this pattern met with limited success.
</p>

<p>
As early as the fourteenth century, council governance in England started to look very different. While English monarchs governed jointly with Parliament, they also succeeded in imposing the requirement that deputies be sent without mandates from their constituencies and that majority decisions should be binding.
</p>

<p>
This British pattern of deputies not having mandates would eventually become the norm for all modern democracies. No representative democracy since the late eighteenth century has allowed for explicit mandates—all that can be attempted are informal efforts like the Republican Party’s “Contract with America” of 1994, and the absence of mandates has major consequences for the way democracy functions.
</p>

<p>
irony of England is that it was monarchical power that helped drive the shift away from early democracy, and so modern democracy incorporates an element of autocracy. It is for this reason that once Parliament became supreme after 1688, William Blackstone, the famous jurist, would write that it had “absolute despotic power.
</p>

<p>
While England initiated the development of modern democracy, it was slow to advance the process further. Even after what is commonly known as the “Great Reform Act” of 1832, only a tiny fraction of the total population could vote.31 Here we face a puzzle: while seventeenth-century English radicals like the Levellers first conceived of universal male suffrage as a way to govern a society, their ideas would first be implemented in North America and not in England. Though we often think of 1776 or 1787 as the beginning of American democracy, from the seventeenth century a very broad suffrage—for free white males—became the norm in England’s North American colonies.
</p>

<p>
A broad manhood suffrage took hold in the British part of colonial North America not because of distinctive ideas but for the simple reason that in an environment where land was abundant and labor
</p>

<p>
ordinary people had good exit options. This was the same fundamental factor that had favored democracy in other societies. Granting political rights and shared rule was a necessary consequence because those at the top were in a weak position. The merchant companies and others who were charged with creating colonies initially tried to govern in a hierarchical manner, but this did not last long. Lacking coercive and administrative capacity, they soon found they needed to govern jointly with assemblies of colonists. The first of these took place at Jamestown, Virginia, in 1619.
</p>

<p>
There is also a second, tragic side to the story of how labor scarcity influenced governance in North America, and this too began in 1619. The same environmental conditions that pushed colonial governments to offer political rights to whites created incentives to establish a system of slavery
</p>

<p>
Whether you enjoyed political rights or were enslaved depended on the quality of what economists would call your “outside option.” Apart from those who were taken involuntarily, and we will see that these cases existed, British migrants faced a choice of not coming to the New World in the first place. Africans arriving in the New World did not have this option. Once in the New World, British migrants unhappy with the conditions on offer could often manage to move elsewhere, but African slaves attempting to escape could hardly expect to meld into the general population, and we know that as early as the Elizabethan period, Africans were seen and portrayed negatively by the English.32 Political rights for whites and slavery for Africans derived from the same underlying environmental condition of labor scarcity.
</p>

<p>
That African Americans did finally secure the vote points to another feature of modern democracy: precisely because it is based on the idea of broad participation, those excluded have a particularly powerful argument for demanding the vote.
</p>

<br>

<p>
U.S. Constitution of 1787 helped advance the transition to modern democracy. It did this in a surprising way by purging many elements of early democracy that had existed in state constitutions as late as the 1780s. After 1787 representatives could no longer be bound by mandates or instructions, whereas this had been common in colonial assemblies as well as in early state assemblies. Likewise, elections would occur less frequently, whereas even after 1776, in state legislatures elections most often occurred annually.
</p>

<p>
Unlike in early democracy, the Constitution allowed for the creation of a powerful central state bureaucracy, and it offered a form of political participation that was broad but also only episodic and that involved governance across a very large territory. We are still in the process of learning whether this experiment can work.
</p>

<p>
Alternative Visions of Democracy<br>
 So far, I have laid out an account of the spread of early democracy and its transformation into modern democracy. There are also alternative views, and these involve the role of political ideas, inequality, and economic development.
</p>

<p>
Even if democracy in Greece eventually died out, the memory of it did not, and from the medieval era onward, western Europeans were able to draw on this Greek tradition, as well as a later Roman one. There are two big problems with this argument.<br>
 The first is that peoples like the Huron or the Tlaxcalans had never read Aristotle, yet they managed to come up with forms of government that struck Europeans as being strikingly democratic. The members of the Germanic assemblies described by Tacitus had not read Aristotle either.
</p>

<p>
even for Europe, the political ideas interpretation does not work that well. I will offer one example here before considering this at greater length in chapter 5. We know that Greek ideas about government were lost to western Europeans sometime after the fall of Rome until they first reappeared in Latin translation
</p>

<p>
The political theorist J. G. A. Pocock argued that the rediscovery of Greek ideas about the polis had a profound effect on the independent city republics of northern Italy, but this does not help us much with understanding how these city republics emerged in the first place. We know that Aristotle’s Politics first appeared in Latin translation sometime around 1260 CE, but the vast majority of Italian communes became autonomous long before this date. It would seem that medieval townspeople had to reinvent democratic governance on their own, and it is striking that this happened first in Europe and not in the Islamic Middle East, because Aristotle’s works were never lost in that region.
</p>

<p>
Ideas about democracy matter, and I will emphasize that throughout this book. But the simple notion that Europeans had democracy because of the classical tradition fails to convince.
</p>

<p>
Inequality<br>
 The idea that inequality is prejudicial to democracy is deeply rooted—in a society divided into haves and have-nots, there will be jealousies that undermine peaceful democratic governance. Have-nots may also be more susceptible to the appeals of demagogues, so democracy should not survive for long in the face of high inequality.<br>
 It also stands to reason that there will be powerful forces that foster equality in a democracy. Since the poor outnumber the rich, they can vote for candidates proposing to do something about inequality.
</p>

<p>
There is less support for the standard view of inequality and democracy than one might think. Exhibit A for this claim is western Europe during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. In many countries, modern democracy emerged and was maintained in spite of high and increasing inequality. Simultaneously, democracy alone often did little to change inequality, and over time elites realized this. If the authors of the Federalist Papers were obsessed with the danger that a republic could pose to property, by the late nineteenth century, western European elites learned to take a more blasé attitude—why worry about universal suffrage if it did not result in you being taxed heavily or expropriated?
</p>

<p>
democracy may be more stable than we think in the face of high inequality, but if you are worried about inequality, then democracy alone does not provide the solution.
</p>

<p>
One of the most tenacious ideas about democracy is that it can only exist in rich countries. It’s not hard to see where this idea might come from because the world’s richest countries today are almost always democracies. The principal reason offered for this is that when there are fewer poor people, there will be less of an audience for autocratic demagogues. Poor people may feel like they have less to lose from alternatives to democracy, and they may also be less well educated about the political process, or so the argument goes.
</p>

<p>
The idea that economic development was a prerequisite for democracy was greatly strengthened by Seymour Martin Lipset, one of the most prominent political scientists of the twentieth century. Writing in 1959, Lipset investigated various indicators of development: per capita income, the number of persons per motor vehicle and per physician, and the number of radios, telephones, and newspapers. Lipset’s data suggested that countries scoring poorly on these measures found it harder to maintain a stable democracy. Since the time he wrote, there has been much debate about this conclusion. Some believe development does indeed cause democracy.34 Others say democracy and development are each caused by other underlying factors.
</p>

<p>
The problem with the economic development hypothesis is that if we see the emergence of democracy in Europe as a very long process
</p>

<p>
we need to remember that in these earlier centuries Europe was not more developed than the rest of the world—in fact, the reverse was often true. Even when they transitioned to modern democracy, many European countries were quite poor by our current standards. At the advent of the French Third Republic in 1870, France had the same level of per capita GDP that Tanzania does
</p>

<p>
We draw similarly nuanced conclusions when we flip the relationship and ask what effect democracy has on economic development. The standard argument is that democracy will be more favorable to growth because in a democracy people will feel that their property is more secure. I will take a deep dive into this issue in chapter 8.
</p>

<p>
Precisely because the early democratic regime was one of decentralized power, there was little risk of a central ruler trampling on property rights. However, decentralized power can also lead to barriers to entry for new market entrants, and for this reason, early democracy could present a brake on innovation. The Dutch Republic presents an example of this. When we look at autocracies we see a reverse pattern: in China and the Middle East it helped to create a very wide market across which ideas and innovations could travel, but the Achilles’ heel of autocracy was instability. With centralized power and a bureaucratic state, the risk was that rulers could suddenly shift policy in undesirable directions.
</p>

<br>

<p>
As the first true modern democracy, the United States has had an integrated national market, but even so, barriers to entry as a result of monopoly power have emerged time and again.
</p>

<p>
In comparative terms modern democracy has existed for only a brief time. We should see it as an ongoing experiment and perhaps even be surprised that modern democracy has survived at all. Across the broad sweep of human history, societies either were governed autocratically by someone who disposed of a state bureaucracy or had something resembling early democracy where the state was absent, power was decentralized, and their overall size was likely to be small. The idea that one could sustain a democracy in a polity as large as the thirteen American colonies, combined with a central state, was unprecedented.
</p>

<p>
We can use the lessons of history to draw three conclusions about the future of democracy.
</p>

<br>

<p>
New Democracies<br>
 The first conclusion concerns the many new democracies that have emerged since 1989. There is a great deal of justified fear about democratic retrenchment or “backsliding” around the globe today, and news accounts provide us with example after example of countries that are sliding into autocracy. Political scientists have even invented a whole new category for countries that no longer qualify as democracies but still have elections—they call these cases competitive authoritarianism.37
</p>

<p>
you would have said this was unlikely. Ghana was too poor and too ethnically divided to survive as a democracy.<br>
 So why did the predictions from 1988 prove so wrong? The unanticipated fall of the Berlin Wall would be one big reason, but the recent wave of democratization cannot be attributed solely to the disappearance of superpower rivalry. The deeper lesson that history offers is that under certain conditions, and these are hardly rare, democratic governance is something that comes naturally to humans. Many of the societies that transitioned to democracy after 1989 had practiced forms of early democracy long before they encountered Europeans. The technology of modern democracy, with elections and parties, is something new, but the basic principle of demokratia—that the people ought to have power—is not.
</p>

<br>

<p>
just as early democracy existed in lieu of a state, democratization since 1989 has been more likely to survive when the initial power of the central state is weak. African countries with weaker state structures circa 1989 are more likely to be democracies today, while in the Middle East the persistence of state coercive structures over centuries has weighed against democracy.
</p>

<p>
One final thing we need to note about the spread of modern democracy is that in many cases, institutions of electoral accountability have been layered over preexisting institutions of early democracy. There is reason to believe, as the political scientist Kate Baldwin has shown, that even in this new context, institutions of early democracy can continue to provide important forms of accountability.
</p>

<p>
The second prediction some people made about democracy in 1989 involves China, and it too proved to be equally wrong. Some asked whether market-driven economic development would necessarily lead to political liberalization and to China starting to look more like the West. It was thought that as society grew richer, people would be in a stronger position to demand democracy. It was also thought that growth could only be maintained with political liberalization. Neither of these predictions has proven true, or at least not so far.
</p>

<p>
For a long period during the last two millennia, China was richer than Europe even though the form of governance in China was autocratic and bureaucratic whereas European rulers had to govern through assemblies.
</p>

<p>
Commercial Revolution of the Middle Ages in western Europe is often credited with furthering the advance of early democracy, but we will see that China also had a medieval commercial revolution of its own. This was associated with higher levels of income per capita than in western Europe, but this did nothing to shift China away from autocracy, so why should we expect Chinese growth in more recent times to produce a different 
</p>

<p>
In the end, rather than seeing China as a deviation from a standard route for political development set by Europeans, it is instead simply an alternative route for governance
</p>

<p>
A deeper look at the history of democracy tells us that we may still have reasons for optimism but only if we understand what has allowed American democracy to survive: continued investments to keep citizens connected with a distant state.<br>
 The Constitution
</p>

<p>
Within three short years of the Constitution’s adoption, in an essay titled “Public Opinion,” James Madison himself would emphasize that in any republic covering a vast territory, concrete investments needed to be made to ensure that the public can inform itself about government.
</p>

<p>
therefore supported efforts by Congress to subsidize the distribution of newspapers. Some have credited this with helping to stabilize the Early Republic. Others advocated state support of schooling in the Early Republic for exactly the same reason, and this gave birth to the Common School movement.<br>
 The broader lesson of Madison’s essay on public opinion is that in a large democracy, the idea that the public can accurately inform itself so that it trusts government cannot be taken for granted.
</p>

<p>
larger democracies tend to have lower levels of trust in government than do smaller democracies. We
</p>

<p>
, we should also distinguish between the survival of democracy in general and the survival of a democracy with which we are satisfied. If citizens feel increasingly disconnected and distrustful, and there is a perception that democratic politics is dominated by a few, the survival of our form of government may seem like less of a victory than we originally thought.
</p>

<p>
Early democracy had several common features.<br>
 The most crucial element of early democracy was that those who ruled needed to obtain consent for their decisions from a council or assembly. Even in the most autocratic systems, no one ever truly rules alone—they need to rule through subordinates whom they might ask for advice before making decisions. But this is fundamentally different from needing to obtain consent from a council or assembly of individuals who are independent from you and who may well be your equals. This was early democracy.<br>
 A second element present in many, though not all, early democracies was that rulers did not simply inherit their position: there was some way in which rising to leadership required the consent of others.
</p>

<p>
Writing of what he saw as the democratic system of the Native Americans of the Great Plains, Robert Lowie observed that “as the son of a Rockefeller or Morgan has a better chance to become a great businessman than has a guttersnipe, so a Cree chief’s son was more readily acclaimed as a brave man than an orphan would be.”
</p>

<p>
The Athenian Precedent<br>
 Scholars commonly say that Athens had a democratic system of government from 508 BCE thanks to a set of reforms introduced by an aristocrat named Cleisthenes.2 The word demokratia did not appear until somewhat after this date, as Cleisthenes himself referred to isonomia—equal laws for all.3 Democracy persisted in Athens, albeit with interruptions, until Macedon conquered the city in 322 BCE.
</p>

<p>
Athenian democracy was the product of a long evolution, with many of the same background conditions that we will see outside of Greece. It
</p>

<p>
In the new Greek states that emerged after the Bronze Age collapse, rulers lacked bureaucracies, and they instead found themselves obliged to rule through consultation. We can see possible evidence for this in both the Iliad and the Odyssey.8 Written to describe events of the Bronze Age, some argue that these two texts bear traces of the society in which they were composed as it existed around 700 BCE. They describe how the Greeks thought the Cyclopes were uncivilized because they held no meetings or councils or agorai. In another instance elders in a meeting propose judgments and ordinary people express their opinions.
</p>

<p>
Compact geography favored the development of early democracy in Greece in the same way that it would later do so elsewhere: before the advent of modern transport, the simple fact of getting to an assembly could be a burdensome task.
</p>

<p>
By the year 594 BCE Athens faced a severe economic crisis combined with class antagonism.
</p>

<p>
Solon abolished the system of debt bondage and created a new council, the boule—the council of four hundred—that would rival the areopagus. The boule prepared the agenda for a larger assembly of citizens known as the ekklesia. After Solon’s reforms all adult male citizens could participate in the ekklesia, but membership in the boule was still only open to the wealthy.<br>
 The subsequent reforms of Cleisthenes
</p>

<p>
Cleisthenes reorganized Athens into 139 demes—units of 150 to 250 individuals.13 In addition to belonging to a deme, citizens were associated with one of ten new artificially created “tribes” that now each sent 50 individuals, selected by lot, to a Council of 500 that would administer the day-to-day affairs of the 
</p>

<p>
the demes comprising a given tribe did not come from the same geographic region in Attica. This created what political scientists would call a “cross-cutting cleavage.
</p>

<p>
The Athenian structure of tribes bears an uncanny resemblance to the clan structure of the Huron and the Iroquois—one could be a member of the same clan as someone else without living in the same locality. This cross-cutting pattern seems a good strategy to better bind a society together.
</p>

<p>
The reforms of 462 BCE happened at a time when the elite of Athens needed their people. The logic behind giving the thetes a greater political voice was laid out by an Athenian observer who has become known to posterity as the “Old Oligarch.” He was no champion of democracy but saw it as necessary for the following reason.
</p>

<p>
 It is right that the poor and the ordinary people there [in Athens] should have more power than the noble and rich,
</p>

<p>
led to Athenian democracy were not—we will see them time and again. The first of these was small scale. Athens may have been large relative to other Greek city-states, but it was small compared to other neighbors in the region. In addition, from the Persian wars onward, the elite of Athens needed the broader population for military service, and this led to the quid pro quo of service in exchange for political rights.19 Finally, Athenian democracy emerged after the collapse of a prior autocratic and bureaucratic order.
</p>

<br>

<p>
It is common to suggest that in early hunter gatherer societies some form of “primitive democracy” was the natural political system. It is equally common to suggest that this practice disappeared with the invention of agriculture—Robert Dahl said this in his 1998 book On Democracy, a canonical text among political scientists.20 In fact, Dahl was overly hasty in declaring early democracy’s decline; many human societies maintained early democracy long after the transition away from small bands of hunter gatherers. 
</p>

<p>
One of the oldest examples of early democracy comes from ancient Mesopotamia during the third and second millennia BCE. In 1943, a Danish Assyriologist named Thorkild Jacobsen asserted that governance by assemblies was common in Mesopotamia before centralizing rulers destroyed this pattern. Jacobsen had no direct evidence to back up this claim, so he referred to the Epic of Gilgamesh in which a discussion takes place between King Gilgamesh and a council of elders. It is said that Gilgamesh sought popular support in a conflict
</p>

<p>
Later scholars dismissed these accounts as a case of outsiders projecting images of institutions from back home onto foreign societies. Despotism—so they thought—must have been the norm.27<br>
 There was little further discussion of ancient Indian republics until the twentieth century, and this time the debate became colored by the colonial context. If Indians had only ever governed themselves through tyranny, this might somehow legitimize British rule; if there was instead a history of Indian republics, then this could justify independence.
</p>

<p>
Some modern anthropologists argue that matrilocality emerges when women play an important role in food production, and with the Iroquois and the Huron this occurred through maize agriculture.47 There is also another hypothesis: matrilocality is a strategy for a dominant group that is expanding into territory with subordinate groups. In this case, matrilocality would have first become a practice a thousand years ago when the Huron and the Iroquois entered the area.
</p>

<p>
The style of agriculture that its inhabitants practiced may provide one reason for early democracy’s survival in Tlaxcala. The Aztecs in the valley of Mexico practiced an intensive form of agriculture, aided by irrigation, where it was relatively easy for rulers to track what people could produce. Descriptions of Tlaxcalan agriculture suggest that it was more primitive.56 The ruggedness and variability of rainfall within the province of Tlaxcala may have made it harder for rulers to know how much people were producing.
</p>

<p>
We have seen five examples of early democracy in regions as diverse as Mesopotamia, ancient India, the Northeastern Woodlands of America, Mesoamerica, and Central Africa. Given this great variety, it is hard to sustain the argument that the practice of democracy was invented in one place at one time; it is instead something that comes naturally to humans. But just because early democracy came naturally did not mean that it was inevitable, and in the section to follow we will see that autocracy too was present in many regions.
</p>

<p>
To understand how the Inka went from being a small group of maize farmers to ruling the largest empire in the Americas, we need to first consider the local institution called the ayllu upon which their empire was built.78 At the time of Spanish conquest, the ayllu was the basic community structure throughout the Andes: a grouping of roughly a thousand individuals who held land communally and who had reciprocal obligations to each other.
</p>

<p>
 key point was that blood relations or no, they all acted like a family by cooperating and insuring each other against risk. Some say that the ayllu emerged thousands of years ago as part of a human adaptation to an uncertain natural environment, but others claim it emerged during the pre-Inka period in response to state formation.79 In either case, the ayllu formed the basic building block
</p>

<p>
The most common understanding of revenue extraction in the Inka economy is that rulers employed an ideology where the mutual obligation involved in an individual ayllu was applied to the whole empire. In practical terms this mostly meant moving people for corvée labor obligations rather than moving goods. This would later help form the basis for the mita and encomienda systems of forced labor used by Spanish conquerors. The Inkas also extensively resettled people in new areas—by one estimate between three and five million people.81 This is a staggering figure considering that we are speaking of a society without modern means of transport and communication, or even the wheel.
</p>

<p>
Some people might infer that mound building implied autocracy. The example of ancient Egypt is undoubtedly what motivates this as we think of servile labor constructing tombs for Pharaoh. Others suggest we should not be so quick to assume this negative interpretation. It could have been that the population wanted to participate in a great undertaking, much like the way the Champs de Mars was built voluntarily by the population of Paris during the French Revolution.
</p>

<p>
To evaluate it properly we need broader evidence, and here there is less support: average female contribution to subsistence in the SCCS societies was only slightly higher in cases where women participated in politics.
</p>

<p>
Modern archaeological evidence shows that women did participate in warfare on the Central Asian steppe. We know this from burial evidence in which women were interred with numerous weapons and from the fact that their skeletons often show signs of war injuries.
</p>

<p>
points to a lifetime spent in the saddle, and armed women make up more than a third of the burials at specific sites.
</p>

<p>
A first way to think about inequality is to consult measures that anthropologists have constructed of “social stratification.” The SCCS data support the received view about central governance being associated with greater stratification, and the results are striking. Among societies without any governance above the community, 63 percent had no social stratification, but this was true of only 13 percent of societies with central governance. This is a huge difference. When we instead consider social stratification in societies with and without councils we see much less difference between these two subgroups.109 It appears that central states were associated with stratification, but the way a state was governed—democratically or autocratically—had less impact.
</p>

<p>
Within the data set, societies are coded as stratified if they have “extensive differentiation of occupational status,” or in other words people doing different jobs. That there were multiple types of occupations points to a society being more complex, but it does not tell us how variable the status of people with different occupations actually was. This also tells us nothing about whether it is possible for people to move from one occupation to another. We can recall here that the Republic of Tlaxcala was stratified, but there was also significant social mobility.
</p>

<br>

<p>
Recently, a group of anthropologists and archaeologists have proposed an ingenious new measure of wealth inequality. Lacking direct measures of wealth, they use dispersion in the size of floor plans of houses.
</p>

<p>
The data on house floor plans point to tremendous variability in wealth inequality in ancient societies. At the Teotihuacan site in Mesoamerica—a society that preceded the Aztecs by about a millennium—the Gini coefficient for house size dispersion was 0.12—an extremely low value. If the Gini coefficient for house size mapped directly into actual wealth, this would imply a level of inequality well below that seen in any modern market economy. The situation could not have been more different in the Middle Kingdom of ancient Egypt where, at one site, the Gini coefficient for house size dispersion was 0.68—a figure closer to levels of wealth inequality in European or American society today.
</p>

<p>
Douglass North, the famous economic historian, defined the state as an entity that extracts revenue in exchange for protection.
</p>

<p>
 will argue in this chapter that early democracy was more likely to prevail when rulers were uncertain about production,
</p>

<p>
when people found it easy to exit, and finally when rulers needed their people more than their people needed them. Evidence from multiple world regions at different points in time supports these claims.
</p>

<p>
The problem of exit risk is, in fact, such a general one that it is not limited to human societies. Motivated by her observations about different bird species in different habitats, the ornithologist Sandra Vehrencamp developed a theoretical model
</p>

<p>
In the case of animals there is no question of wealth, taxation, or consent; the issue is instead who gets to reproduce and who is consigned to assisting others as they reproduce. Considering a range of species, Vehrencamp showed that high costs of “dispersal” were associated with greater hierarchy. Dispersal means the possibility for individuals to establish a new place to breed.<br>
 Throughout history early

There is an established idea that societies with central governance emerged in areas that were more suitable for agriculture. The traditional story is that agricultural production generated a surplus, allowing for the emergence of central governance, combined with social hierarchy. Another variant of this argument is that agriculture allowed for higher population densities, and population density made it more likely that central governance would form.
</p>

<p>
suitability does indeed predict whether there is central governance above the level of the individual community. Second, agricultural suitability on its own does not predict whether governance is autocratic or democratic. Said in a different way, the number of calories one can pull out of the ground determines whether you have governance but not the type of governance. To answer that question, we will need to look elsewhere.<br>
 To chart agricultural
</p>

<p>
It turns out that caloric potential is a reliable predictor of central governance. If we look at the set of SCCS societies with caloric potential above the median, central governance existed about 40 percent of the time. In societies with below median suitability, central governance existed in only a quarter of cases.10 Some suggest that it is above all suitability for storable cereal crops that drives this result and not non-storable tubers like yams and cassava. The argument then is that central governance emerges not because there is a surplus but because there is a storable surplus.
</p>

<p>
Whether a society took the democratic or the autocratic path of political development depended less on the number of calories one could pull out of the ground and more on the variability in this measure from location to location. Throughout history, uncertainty about agricultural production has been a major obstacle for rulers seeking to know how much they can tax their constituents.
</p>

<p>
We see clearly here that societies with early democratic governance tended to have higher caloric variability.15
</p>

<p>
Maybe the relationship between councils and caloric variability could be driven by something other than the need for rulers to gain information. Variability in agricultural production might also mean that there would be greater incentives for people to engage in trade, or perhaps to share food as a way of insurance against risk, and this might be managed by a council. It turns out that even after we take account of these additional factors, we still see a close relationship between caloric variability and council presence.18 It is also the case that trade and risk sharing can be managed by an autocracy and not just a council. In autocratic ancient Sumeria temple granaries handled issues like

When anthropologists and archaeologists write about exit options they often use the word “circumscription.” In 1970 Robert Carneiro proposed a circumscription theory of early state formation. The idea was that early states formed in areas with sufficiently high population densities and where some feature of the natural environment made it costly or impossible for people to exit. The Nile Valley in Egypt provides one illustration of this possibility. People initially settled in small groups at different locations in the valley, but as the population grew, settlement became more uniform. Because the Nile Valley was a narrow strip of land with desert on either side, there was eventually no more room to move, and a hierarchically organized state formed.22
</p>

<p>
A tour of different regions reconquered by Europeans tells the tale. In Sicily the Arabs had used irrigation to grow sugar, cotton, citrus fruits, artichokes, spinach, and eggplant. It sounds like it was a heaven for even the most exigent of vegetable lovers. Under European control Sicily reverted to a more basic agricultural regime of growing wheat and grazing livestock, and Sardinia followed the same pattern. In Andalusia, under Arab control the cities of Seville and Cordoba had a mixed form of agriculture involving wheat, olives, and irrigated gardens for many other crops.
</p>

<p>
The story of the reconquest shows that it wasn’t just because Europeans had more abundant rainfall or more land per capita that they failed to adopt more advanced agricultural techniques. For one reason or another, Europeans resisted technological advance, even when they had it essentially handed to them.
</p>

<p>
From European experience, we are used to thinking of the written word as something that is good for democracy, particularly if people have broad access to it. As we will see, that has not always been the case. This was particularly true of forms of writing that were mastered only by a small administrative elite.
</p>

<p>
The demand-side explanation for writing’s origins may help us understand why some societies failed to adopt writing even after they were exposed to it. Jack Goody, the famous anthropologist, suggested that if several precolonial West African societies failed to adopt writing, it was because their economies were based on tubers rather than cereals.
</p>

<p>
there was no need to have writing serve as a time machine because once harvested, agricultural produce had to be consumed rapidly. This fits with the fact that the Asante (in present-day Ghana) never adopted writing for their yam-based economy, but the Hausa (in present-day Nigeria), who had a cereal-based economy, did adopt writing. Broader evidence fits the pattern suggested by Goody. Only 13 percent of societies in the Standard Cross Cultural Sample that had a tuber as their principal agricultural crop also used a formal system of writing or something equivalent to it. Among societies where cereals were the principal crops, 49 percent used writing.
</p>

<p>
One potential problem with Jack Goody’s argument is that the logic might have also operated in the reverse sense:
</p>

<p>
We can deal with this issue by looking not at whether a society actually grew tubers versus cereals but instead at the relative suitability of the land on which it was located for tubers versus cereals. When looking at relative suitability for tubers and cereals we continue to see a very strong empirical association: writing was much less present in areas most suitable to tubers.
</p>

<p>
Even if there is a need for one, a system of writing is a hard thing for a society to develop on its own. Throughout history, the way in which most societies have dealt with this problem is to borrow their writing system from neighbors.34<br>
 Writing is thought to have been independently invented in three locations.
</p>

<p>
It turns out that within the Standard Cross Cultural Sample, distance from the Olmecs, the Sumerians, or the Chinese is a strong predictor of whether a society had a system of writing. Further tests support the idea of a causal relationship between distance, suitability for cereals as opposed to tubers, and the adoption of writing.
</p>

<p>
 writing makes it easier to track economic production, then this might also make it easier to govern without the assistance of a council.
</p>

<p>
If writing in general emerged in multiple places, the idea of an alphabet appears to have emerged in only one place at one time: all alphabets used by humans have derived from the Old Canaanite alphabet and its successor, the Phoenician alphabet.
</p>

<p>
 we are going to ask whether alphabetic writing helped democratize society, it would also help to know why the Canaanites and Phoenicians developed it in the first place. The Old Canaanite alphabet is known to have been derived from a prior alphabet that was pictographic in form, but this says nothing about the motivation of those who sought to transform this earlier writing form. One interpretation sees the development of Canaanite script as part of an attempt by scribes in the city-state of Ugarit to develop a political identity independent from the larger empires that surrounded them.44 In this case it would have nothing to do with a democratizing influence.
</p>

<p>
 we march through a list of technologies where Europeans were (mostly) behind other societies, we might begin to wonder why it was that Europeans conquered the world rather than the other way around. The answer to this may be that while Europeans were behind in many areas, they were far in advance when it came to firearms technology. When Hernán Cortés and his army encountered the Aztecs, they discovered a society that had a more sophisticated system of agricultural production and taxation than existed in his native Spain. But the Spaniards had guns, and the Aztecs did 
</p>

<p>
consider the following example offered by Hoffman. Between 1600 and 1750 the firing rate for French troops using their muskets increased by a factor of ten.46 This amounts to an annual rate of labor productivity growth of 1.5 percent, something we might expect to see in a modern advanced economy during an economic expansion.
</p>

<p>
The best explanation for European firearms development may lie in the fierce interstate competition that gripped the continent for half a millennium leading up to 1815. Technological advances would have brought high returns in this context. This is the explanation offered by Hoffman. The one caveat I would offer to this is that for a long time, interstate competition between European states did not result in the development of the sort of extractive capacity by states that had been seen in Song dynasty China or Abbasid Iraq more than a thousand years previously. For one reason or another, Europeans were better at developing guns than at building bureaucracies.
</p>

<p>
But if the great economic divergence is explained by this political divergence, then why did the political divergence take place? Over the next four chapters I will try to provide a new answer to this question.
</p>

<p>
Counting himself very much in the latter camp, Montesquieu observed that “this beautiful system was discovered in the woods.”2 In the nineteenth century, François Guizot, a famous French historian and politician, would write of the “ancient liberty of the forest.”
</p>

<p>
The system of assemblies described by Tacitus is early democracy. There is tantalizing evidence from several centuries later that some Germanic groups may have also developed a system of political representation. In a representative system, people in localities select individuals who represent them in central assemblies. Europeans cannot claim to have invented representation; 
</p>

<p>
Even if the Marklo assembly never really took place, what is fascinating about this story is that as early as the ninth century, someone in western Europe had conceived of a representative government operating along these lines and spreading over a broad territory. As with Tacitus, this reinforces the idea that democratic behavior, or at least the thought of democratic behavior, is something that is natural in human societies.
</p>

<p>
Early medieval western European states also had an important Roman inheritance to add to their Germanic one, and the legacy left by the Romans was fundamentally different than that bequeathed to outside invaders in China and the Middle East as Walter Scheidel has recently emphasized.11 Even at the empire’s height, Rome never succeeded in constructing a strong central state bureaucracy. Nor did Roman emperors even really attempt this, at least until the reign of Diocletian, which began in 285 CE. Roman governance instead relied on a strategy of indirect rule over the other societies that they conquered. The pattern in western Europe was to govern through cities whose elites were given the status of Roman citizens
</p>

<p>
Each city and the territory governed was called a civitas. A civitas was then governed by a council that in the West was called a curia. Members of the curia sat for life and typically numbered one hundred per city, though sometimes a curia could have up to six hundred members.13 This pattern would reemerge in medieval western Europe after the rebirth of the towns. Rulers of a great many premodern empires relied on local elites to aid with governance, but the Roman model was particularly decentralized. Under Diocletian the size of the Roman bureaucracy increased, and the standard estimate for the overall size of the late Roman bureaucracy was about thirty thousand individuals when all types of officials are considered.14 As we will see in the next chapter, this was still only one-fourth the number of bureaucrats present in roughly the same era in Han China.
</p>

<p>
Whatever central state organization the Romans did create in western Europe collapsed soon after the empire’s fall. In places like Gaul, the Romans left a pattern of organization that persisted at the local level, but the central structure to bind these localities together vanished.15 There is considerable uncertainty about exactly when central taxation collapsed in the Roman provinces of the West. The best assessment is probably to say that the Germanic rulers inherited tax systems that were in a considerable state of decay even if in some places, such as Visigothic Spain, they carried on for a time. What is also clear is that rather than relying on formal taxation, the more common pattern in the Germanic kingdoms was for rulers to exchange land for service.16 Ultimately, this led to a fragmented polity.
</p>

<p>
the pattern in the East could hardly have been more different. Byzantium actually started with a representative assembly: the old Senate of the Roman Empire in the East. This might have seemed a good start for early democracy, but over time the body became increasingly dominated by the bureaucracy—emperors expanded its size and appointed bureaucrats directly to senatorial positions. Emperor Leo VI, who ruled from 886 to 912, revoked any real remaining powers that the Senate held. George Ostrogorsky, the preeminent historian of Byzantium, suggested that Leo’s legislation marked the end of a long process whereby all power was placed in the hands of the emperor and the state bureaucracy, stripping representative bodies of any real authority.
</p>

<p>
The availability of loess soil over a continuous area probably facilitated development of a centralized society.<br>
 Europe’s first farmers were a people known as the LBK culture, which is short for Linearbandkeramik. These people—so named for the distinctive banded designs on the pottery they left—also settled in areas with loess deposits, typically in river valleys.19 But while China had a single Loess Plateau, in Europe deposits of this soil were much smaller and geographically separated from each other. This gave rise to a decentralized pattern of social organization following what ecologists call the “ideal despotic distribution.” The first individuals to arrive in an area rich in loess would occupy the best land. Offspring and/or subsequent arrivals would occupy plots of successively lower quality.

 Soil distribution may have favored
</p>

<p>
Instead of making agriculture progressively more intensive, Europeans sustained further population increase by expanding cultivation into new land by clearing marshes, swamps, and forests. This movement continued through the middle of the thirteenth century, at which point most arable land had been cleared. The development of the heavy plow also facilitated this transition. Rulers would have been enticed by the possibility of taxing agricultural production on newly cleared land, but they also faced a new information problem. On virgin territory, with no clear track record, it was more difficult to verify how much could be produced and therefore what tax rate should be set.
</p>

<p>
Some have claimed that European agricultural conditions were also very unpredictable. The great French medievalist Georges Duby believed that “Western Europe is incontestably one of the most varied regions in the world in its local agricultural conditions.”23 Based on a twelfth-century record, he found that wheat yields on two estates near Cluny (in the Mâconnais) were 6:1 and 2:1, respectively, in the same year. This ratio refers to the amount of crop that is produced given a set amount of seed sown. Yields also varied substantially from one year to the next.24<br>
 Duby’s claims about variability turn out to be difficult to validate with systematic data.
</p>

<p>
In the end, it is possible that medieval European agriculture was more variable than agriculture in other areas, but the most salient feature of western European agriculture was the very low yields relative to societies in Sumeria, Egypt, and China.
</p>

<p>
Roman structures for central control over each pagus did not survive the empire’s end. Frankish Gaul was an extreme example of this bureaucratic collapse, but even in Italy itself, if Ostrogothic invaders inherited elements of Roman central administration, those too soon melted away.
</p>

<p>
As a part of his conquest, Clovis and subsequent Merovingian rulers inherited the lands that had once been the private preserve of the Roman emperors. These came to be known as the fisc.30 Merovingian and Carolingian rulers drew much of their revenue from these lands. They also attempted to raise taxes but without great success.31 In some cases, these taxes were referred to as “gifts.”32 This points to the weak position in which rulers found themselves—no one ever referred to taxes paid to a Chinese emperor as gifts.
</p>

<br>

<p>
As would be normal in any bureaucracy, the original intention of the Carolingians was that counts served at the pleasure of the emperor, but in practice replacement seems to have been rare, and the same person could hold office in the same area for as much as thirty years. Gradually, count positions remained within the same family, and by the end of the ninth century they became hereditary.
</p>

<p>
We can see better evidence for the strength of the Anglo-Saxon state when we consider precisely why direct taxes on land were so difficult for other European rulers to collect. Direct taxes on land require some system of assessment, and conducting assessments is not something that a ruler can do with the help of only a handful of people. In one historian’s memorable words, “The Anglo-Saxon financial system, which collected the Danegeld, was not run from a box under the bed.”59 One of the interesting features of governance in Anglo-Saxon England is that administration was conducted in the vernacular—what we today call Old English—instead of Latin.
</p>

<p>
The fascinating way in which Anglo-Saxon rulers administered their tax system was like a halfway house between early democracy and the bureaucratic alternative.62 As in the bureaucratic alternative, Anglo-Saxon kings were able to appoint subordinates who themselves played a role in tax assessment. However, the number of these officials was undoubtedly too small for this method alone to work. In addition to having subordinates, Anglo-Saxon monarchs also made use of assemblies of local notables, a hallmark of early democracy.
</p>

<p>
Names like this are not unique to the Anglo-Saxons. In the Dutch Republic city councils became known as the vroedschap, which also means a meeting of the wise. If one is trying to legitimate such an assembly—where participation was restricted to a few—then it is probably helpful to claim that those attending are wiser than everyone else.<br>
 In the end, what was exceptional about the witan was not its name but its composition.
</p>

<p>
Quod Omnes Tangit: A Theory of Consent<br>
 The Carolingians and Anglo-Saxons innovated in the use of assemblies, but they did not have an explicit theory of consent-based rule; this would be a development of the thirteenth century.
</p>

<p>
Here he intentionally echoed a principle of Roman law found in the Justinian Code: Quod omnes tangit, ab omnibus tractari et approbari debet. In literal translation, this means, “That which touches all ought to be discussed and approved by all.
</p>

<p>
 was, in fact, the Catholic Church that first established QOT as a principle of governance. A number of scholars have emphasized how secular governments during the medieval period borrowed from practices initiated in the church.66 As we will see, there was a common theme explaining why so many European leaders, both secular and clerical, adopted QOT: they needed money and they had no way of getting it without first obtaining consent from those they governed.
</p>

<p>
One reason why bureaucracy in autonomous cities did not result in autocracy may involve scale. In autonomous cities, the scale of governance remained one where people could continue to effectively pose constraints on government, and Susan Reynolds, the noted historian of the period, has suggested that this was a general phenomenon.89<br>
 A second reason why autonomous cities did not become autocracies has to do with the sequencing. By all accounts, autonomous cities initially involved broad, participatory governance in the absence of an established bureaucracy, and bureaucracy came later.90
</p>

<p>
The development of Chinese cities provides the most striking contrast with western Europe. We will see in the next chapter that like western Europe, China also experienced a commercial revolution in the early part of the Song dynasty, which ruled from 960 to 1279. But Chinese cities did not become autonomous. The rulers of the Song used their existing bureaucratic base to set up a system for directly taxing commerce rather than relying on autonomous cities to do this for them. Indirect taxes on commerce would prove to be a major source of revenue for Song rulers, who, we should remember, were able to extract a tenth of GDP or more in taxes.
</p>

<p>
This shift was, in all likelihood, facilitated by the fact that church leaders already disposed of the idea that one person could symbolically represent a collectivity.
</p>

<p>
The place in Europe where plena potestas really took off was in England. As early as the fourteenth century there was no longer any mention of mandates or to refer back to constituencies for making decisions. Simultaneously, there was a practice whereby majority decisions bound all, rather than having individual localities be able to opt out. All of these are crucial elements of modern democracy. I will consider this transition at length in chapter
</p>

<p>
To think about Philip the Fair’s ability to raise revenue, we need to first recognize that according to one popular fiscal theory of the time, a king should not be raising any revenue at all. When Philip ascended to the throne, French fiscal doctrine suggested that the king should draw revenues exclusively from his own royal domains instead of by taxing his own subjects. This idea became associated with the phrase “le roi doit vivre du sien” or “the king must live of his own.”106 No one ever said anything like this in the Middle East or in China. In 1271 Thomas Aquinas offered the caveat that if in exceptional circumstances the king’s domain income was insufficient, then a tax on his Christian subjects
</p>

<p>
In spite of having a broad panoply of taxes to choose from, the level of revenue extraction that Philip achieved paled in comparison with that of the Song dynasty or the Abbasid Caliphate, or a number of other non-European societies for that matter. The scattered nature of royal accounts in France makes it difficult to produce a firm number for Philip’s revenues, but one source does report the total quantity of “extraordinary” taxes Philip levied between 1295 and 1314 as 10,625,000 livres tournois.109 Using any reasonable estimates for GDP per capita and population, this was less than 1 percent of GDP in taxes per year.
</p>

<p>
Conclusion<br>
 The fundamental factor that made for the development of representative government in Europe was the backwardness of its state bureaucracies; this left rulers with no alternative but to govern by negotiating and seeking consent from Europe’s growing towns. Underlying this was a pattern of extensive agriculture and technological backwardness that weighed against the development of a strong central state bureaucracy. Governance through negotiation and consent was not a process that Europeans invented, but it was one where they innovated.
</p>

<p>
In medieval Europe we saw that the principle of quod omnes tangit was taken to mean that rulers should seek consent from others. This created an ex ante constraint on their rule, like in any early democracy. The thinkers of the Zhou dynasty did not take this step, but the mandate of heaven instead became a form of ex post accountability. As emperor, the decisions were up to you alone, but if things did not work out, there would be consequences. Later thinkers would extend this idea by saying that support of the people was to be taken as the sign that things were going well on Earth. This was advocated most explicitly by Mencius, the disciple and interpreter of Confucius.
</p>

<p>
China’s rulers did not simply adopt the Mandate of Heaven as a justification for saying why the previous dynasty had lost its right to rule. Internal court documents show that top officials referred to the mandate as a way of instilling a simple idea: anger the people and you risk losing power. In the year 1085 CE the Song dynasty councillor Lü Gongzhu expressed this idea in the following terms:
</p>

<p>
 Although Heaven is high and far away, Heaven inspects the empire daily. Heaven responds to the deeds of the ruler. If he continuously cultivates himself and treats his people justly, then Heaven sends prosperity, and the Son of Heaven receives the realm for all times.
</p>

<p>
Here again, we have a striking indication that within China’s bureaucratic alternative, there was still some sense of accountability, but it did not involve rulers first asking people what they wanted.
</p>

<p>
Early China Was Not a “Hydraulic” Society<br>
 In 1957 Karl Wittfogel published what would become a very influential, and also heavily criticized, book titled Oriental Despotism. He argued that societies that rely on a centralized system of providing either water (irrigation) or protection from water (flood control) tend toward autocracy. Wittfogel emphasized a functional need for central control, and many have criticized this assumption. In a great number of societies, irrigation has been managed in a decentralized manner, and as Elinor Ostrom famously argued, local communities often solve problems such as these in a self-governing manner.24 The other big problem is that while Chinese agriculture would, over time, come to rely heavily on irrigation, the society of the Shang depended on rain-fed agriculture.
</p>

<p>
under slash and burn agriculture, the resources of the land are quickly exhausted, and farmers need to move to new areas. The mobility of this system implies an exit constraint. From a very early date—perhaps around the time of the origins of the Shang—farmers on the Loess Plateau discovered that if they left a field fallow once every three years, then there was no need to move.28 Europeans would not adopt this technique until long afterward. As the form of agriculture became more settled, it is possible that people made other adaptations in their lives that made them less able to move away.<br>
 In the end, the pattern of agriculture may explain why autocracy developed at an early date on the Loess Plateau, but we have no way of knowing this for sure.
</p>

<p>
agriculture may have made people less mobile, the geography of the Loess Plateau is also much different from that of the river valleys of ancient Egypt or Mesopotamia where surrounding desert limited exit options. In northern China, there was much more room for people to move around on fertile land, particularly if they moved to the south, as many would gradually do over time.29<br>
 One final feature of early Chinese state formation may reflect the presence of this open frontier. Absent a strong force of environmental circumscription of the sort found in ancient Egypt, early Chinese texts on statecraft place a heavy emphasis on the control of people’s movements.30 We see less of this in cases such as Sumeria and Egypt.
</p>

<p>
This desire to control people would continue as the Chinese state spread southward.

During the Warring States period, interstate competition had prompted rulers to innovate with respect to both war technology and their ability to extract revenue. The most important development in military technology was the design of a crossbow that required little training to fire—with great accuracy—and could be mass-produced on an industrial scale.
</p>

<p>
Since the advent of the Zhou dynasty, and maybe even before, Chinese rulers had governed through a bureaucracy. This political path was favored both by a natural environment suitable for intensive agriculture and by the development of technologies for production, observation, and control.
</p>

<p>
Warring States rulers developed extensive systems for the direct taxation of agriculture. They also relied on mass conscription of a sort that Europeans would not develop until the nineteenth century.
</p>

<p>
The result of all this was a large, unified empire with a powerful bureaucratic state. By the apogee of the Han dynasty, the imperial bureaucracy is recorded as comprising no fewer than 130,285 individuals. This figure, which is from 5 BCE, includes everyone from the highest officials down to accessory clerks.50 Given a recorded population in 2 CE of 57.7 million, this would imply one bureaucrat for every 440 individuals—an astonishing figure for a premodern society.51 It is also a substantially higher bureaucratic density than existed under the Roman Empire, which is estimated to have had a population similar to that of Han China.52 Even after Diocletian, who ruled from 284 to 305 CE, doubled the size of the bureaucracy, there are thought to have been roughly thirty thousand bureaucrats in the empire.
</p>

<p>
In the Chinese system, the official role of local elites no longer applied. What happened instead is that ordinary people were “represented” by someone who scored well on an exam.54 This system was clearly less democratic—the state now chose who would represent you. But from the perspective of an ordinary person, it is not clear you were necessarily worse off. Would it be better to be represented by a feudal baron or by a bureaucrat who was recruited through a meritocratic exam?
</p>

<br>

<p>
In later centuries Europeans drew on the Chinese experience as they constructed meritocratic recruitment systems of their own.<br>
 There are two different views
</p>

<p>
Some argue that before that date, clan elites had the background and resources to better equip their members to succeed on the exams; in spite of the new system, they retained their hold on power.57 Two French sociologists, Pierre Bourdieu and Jean-Claude Passeron, would say precisely
</p>

<p>
China Also Had a Commercial Revolution<br>
 China under the Song dynasty (960–1279) had a commercial revolution every bit as significant as the one that we discussed for Europe, and one consequence was that it allowed the Song dynasty to levy revenues on a level that would not be seen in Europe until the nineteenth century.63 
</p>

<p>
European states at this time were embroiled in large-scale wars with other major powers that were becoming increasingly expensive. This was due in part to a simple increase in scale but also to the introduction of expensive new technologies involving fortifications and artillery. In this environment there was a great incentive to expand tax capacity. In China this was less the case. Instead of involving large conflicts with other powers, the primary concerns involved either border wars with small nomadic groups or domestic rebellions.85 Also, external threats came from a single northerly direction.86 Under the Ming, China’s northern frontier was secured on the cheap by resettling criminals and landless people on a set of military farms that were supposed to be self-sustaining.
</p>

<p>
The Qing<br>
 In much scholarly work, the Qing dynasty (1644–1911) gets a bad press; it is seen as substantially weaker than earlier dynasties. There is some truth to this: the amount of revenue the Qing dynasty extracted from Chinese society was considerably less than that of any of its predecessors. During the eighteenth century, the Qing extracted about 2 percent of GDP in revenue each year, and during the nineteenth century this figure would fall to 1 percent or less. As with the Ming, however, we will see that the weakness of the Qing state was not simply a product of absolutism or bureaucratic inefficiency—it was also a deliberate choice.
</p>

<p>
Another way to think of this was that this was “limited government” of a form different than that which emerged in Great Britain after the Glorious Revolution.91 There a representative assembly with a long tradition of collective action gained control of a bureaucracy created by prior Tudor monarchs. In China no such tradition of consensual government existed. To establish a form of limited government the Qing instead chose to not invest in state capacity. By not undertaking further cadastral surveys after 1713, the dynasty effectively committed to not taxing new production attributable to advances in overall agricultural productivity or to a growing population. In the short run this kept internal peace. In the long run, it left the Qing state vulnerable to internal rebellions and external threats.
</p>

<br>
<br>
<br>

<p>
 In the areas where the White Lotus Rebellion took place, overexploitation of the soil resulted in impoverishment of the local population. When combined with extortionate surtaxes levied by local functionaries, this led to a massive rebellion. It was only after using all remaining funds in the imperial treasury that the Qing were able to pacify the area.94 Gravely weakened, the dynasty came near to being overthrown by the rebels of the Taiping Rebellion of 1850 to 1864, and in this case the rebels referred not to Buddhism but instead to apocalyptic ideas derived from Christianity.
</p>

<p>
Faced with such grave threats, after the Taiping the Qing authorities did attempt to raise new revenues, but rather than this occurring through central collection of new land tax revenues, the efforts involved ad hoc exactions by local and provincial officials.96
</p>

<p>
It would be wrong to argue that the natural environment was determinant in leading to this outcome, but it did prove influential. The conditions of the Loess Plateau favored the early development of a high-yield, intensive agriculture in a way that western European conditions did not. But it would be wrong to argue that geography was determinant here because the development of a Chinese bureaucratic state also depended on the fact that the Chinese were ahead of western Europeans when it came to technologies for production and measurement. Ultimately, the Chinese imperial state fell in no small part because a series of emperors chose to dismantle part of the state capacity that they started out with.

democracy was actually the norm in pre-Islamic Arabia and that it continued for a time after the Islamic conquests. It was embodied in the Koranic principle of shura—the idea that rulers should be collectively selected and should consult those they governed. We will see finally that these practices died out under the Umayyad and Abbasid caliphates but for reasons that had little to do with religious doctrine. Umayyad and Abbasid rulers inherited a state bureaucracy, and this allowed them to pursue the autocratic

agricultural land that produced high yields. This land had been extensively surveyed, and there existed a class of bureaucrats with the training and ability to manage the tax system.23 Historians have debated just how heavily the Islamic Caliphate borrowed from the Sasanians, and there were certainly new tax innovations introduced after the conquest. But compare this to Gaul under the Merovingians: there conquerors inherited much land but no bureaucracy or cadastral register, and the type of rain-fed agricultural production made it difficult to construct a new one.
</p>

<br>

<p>
Though they are enshrined in the Koran, caliphs abandoned these democratic principles to rule as autocrats. However, as we saw with the Chinese empire, autocratic rule did not also imply abandoning any idea of accountability. In addition to their bureaucracy, the Islamic caliphs also borrowed a legitimating ideology from the Sasanians: the Circle of Justice. One description of this concept runs as follows.26
</p>

<p>
 There is no authority without men<br>
 and there are no men without money<br>
 and there is no money without cultivation<br>
 and there is no cultivation without justice and good governance
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
 A surprising feature of the Circle of Justice is that descriptions of it often refer explicitly to tax collectors—they are seen as an essential part of a peaceful and prosperous order. The Circle of Justice celebrated the direct role played by the bureaucratic state in maintaining social harmony. For medieval Europeans—who started with the belief that “the king must live of his own”—this would have sounded like a very strange idea indeed.
</p>

<p>
We saw previously that the physical environment of ancient Egypt lent itself to a centralized and autocratic form of rule. For those unhappy with life in the densely populated Nile Valley, there was no exit option. Easy measurement of the Nile flood, facilitated by the invention of the nilometer, helped make yields more predictable. This made a centralized tax administration feasible.
</p>

<p>
The key question we need to ask is why Christian kingdoms in Iberia governed through assemblies whereas Muslim rulers did not.<br>
 To start with,
</p>

<br>

<p>
 It is very unlikely that new ideas alone led to this change in the style of rule in Iberia. The Islamic conquerors also brought with them several things that helped cement autocratic rule. In the year 718 the caliph in Damascus sent a new governor, a large military force, and trained bureaucrats to solidify administration and assess land for the purposes of taxation.35 In other words, they imported a state.
</p>

<p>
It is unclear how quickly the rulers of al-Andalus resorted to direct taxation of agriculture. Initially, they funded their operations by levying a poll tax collected by Christian bishops using parish registers. They also collected a tax from the Muslim population that could be used to gain exemption from military service. Either of these two taxes would have still depended on agricultural production to the extent that those who paid them grew crops that they sold. Eventually there was direct taxation of agriculture, implemented on a progressive scale.36 A literate and effective bureaucracy administered this system in a way that surpassed that of any other kingdom in western Europe at the time.
</p>

<br>

<p>
 A better explanation is that the Achilles’ heel of the caliphate in al-Andalus turned out to be one that has plagued many autocracies: the problem of leadership succession. Despite all of its strengths, the history of Muslim government in al-Andalus suggests that much like the early Abbasid Caliphate, leaders tended to have very short tenures. Between 929 and 1031, rulers of al-Andalus governed for an average of less than seven years. In the year 1031 the last Umayyad caliph was exiled from Cordoba, the central administration collapsed, and al-Andalus broke apart into a set of petty kingdoms
</p>

<p>
The Disappearance of Islamic Democracy<br>
 Instead of democracy being reborn through state collapse, as happened in Europe, the inhabitants of the Islamic world experienced the opposite trend. Conquest led to a shift from early democracy to autocratic imperial rule. Geographic factors helped push in this direction; the rich river valleys of Egypt and Mesopotamia allowed for a strong, centralized state to develop. But environmental factors aside, there was also a role of contingency in all this. It mattered that the Islamic conquests happened in the wake of centralizing reforms in Sasanian Iraq.
</p>

<p>
Instead of conquering a state that was already in crisis—as happened with the fall of Rome—the Islamic invaders inherited a state in its prime.
</p>

<p>
The other factor that weighed against democracy in the Islamic world was the speed with which the empire grew. This rapid expansion was a product not only of Muslim thought; it was also due to the sweeping success that Muslim armies had, and this was not guaranteed at the outset. We have seen a pattern so far where societies that governed themselves through early democracy tended to be small in scale.
</p>

<p>
Some have suggested that what the Arab peoples really needed to do was to develop a practice of representation of the sort that Europeans used to overcome the constraints of scale.40 But in Europe it took societies centuries to develop a full-fledged idea of representation—people had the time to figure this out because the geographical scope of individual states expanded slowly. In the Islamic world the expansion happened within a few short decades.
</p>

<p>
it was rapid acquisition of a strong state—not the arrival of Islam—that mattered most for the course of political development. Supporting this view, if we want to predict which countries today are democratic, the mere presence of Islam does a poor job. The country with the largest majority Islamic population, Indonesia, has been a vibrant democracy for several decades now. There are also vibrant democracies in West Africa and elsewhere that are majority Muslim. It turns out that whether a territory was conquered by Arab armies during the seventh and eighth centuries is a much better predictor of current autocracy than is the presence of Islam.
</p>

<p>
What I think we can say with more confidence is that by steering things in an initial autocratic direction, the Islamic conquests did help weigh against the future development of democracy. It is also true that successive autocratic regimes in the region have learned from the practices of their predecessors.
</p>

<p>
concept of the Circle of Justice was not finally officially abandoned by the Ottoman Empire until 1839.
</p>

<br>

<p>
we can also see that the pattern of conquerors—or would-be conquerors—choosing to inherit a state bureaucracy remains a practice even today. Consider the following passage from the text called the Principles in the Administration of the Islamic State.
</p>

<p>
 Preserving the capabilities [personnel and infrastructure] that managed the production projects under the prior governments, whilst taking into account the need to place strict oversights and an administration affiliated with the Islamic State.
</p>

<p>
Rule through representative assemblies is thought by many to have usefully constrained rulers from threatening innovation and production.1 Part and parcel of this was that Europe was politically fragmented, and scholars have argued that this too spurred economic development.2 There is also a debate about democracy and development in more contemporary settings.3<br>
 According to the standard view, the situation in China and the Islamic world could not have been more different from Europe: autocracy stifled development. The fact that the Industrial Revolution happened in Europe—not in China or the Middle East—is exhibit A in favor of this claim, and it is a hard one to dispute. But if we look further back in time we immediately encounter a problem with this line of reasoning.
</p>

<p>
China and the Islamic world were ahead in terms of economic development. How can this be? I will argue here that democracies and autocracies each have specific strengths and weaknesses when it comes to economic development.
</p>

<p>
 Autocrats Did Well Early but Not Later<br>
 There is no small amount of debate among economic historians about when Europe overtook China. For many scholars, this occurred well before the Industrial Revolution. For others, the “Great Divergence” happened only because of the Industrial Revolution.4 Whoever is right on this question, we should also recognize that there was a prior, early divergence in which China and the Middle East had living standards substantially above those in western Europe.
</p>

<br>

<p>
 As we compare development outcomes across regions we need to also ask what type of growth was taking place. Some suggest that autocracies may for a time be able to grow more quickly than democracies thanks to their ability to force an increase in investment. Economists documented this phenomenon for the Soviet Union—massive investment produced rapid initial growth that could not be sustained.11 Other economists argue that autocracies starting far from the world technology frontier may be able to grow quickly, but as they reach the frontier they stagnate because autocracy does not favor innovation.
</p>

<p>
in these polities, unity of governance over a large geographic area helped spur innovation. In an era of common jurisdiction with common customs and policies, ideas could flow freely.<br>
 Consider first this description

<p>
 The picture which emerges from our enquiries is one of a large unified region which for three or four centuries—and in places still longer—was unusually receptive to all that was new. It was also unusually able to diffuse novelties: both to effect the initial transfer which introduced an element into a region and to carry out the secondary diffusion which changed rarities into commonplaces.

Economic historians have provided extensive evidence of how the institutions, practices, and policies of later Middle Eastern states sometimes prevented economic change.

<p>
he also argued that China was at a disadvantage when it came to experimental learning for the following reason: if Galileo had lived in China, he would have been a bureaucrat and not a scientist.20 This is an interesting idea, but it begs the question of why experimentation could not be favored within the bureaucracy itself. After all, the early development of the Internet was supported by the U.S. government’s Advanced Research Projects Agency. Many of the technical innovations that occurred in China during the Song dynasty derived directly from the work of bureaucrats. An excellent example here is that of Su Song, a renowned scholar of many different scientific fields who rose to a prominent position in the bureaucracy.
</p>

<p>
maybe science of the experimental variety is fundamentally a democratic enterprise, and so it will most prosper in a democratic environment. By democratic here Needham meant not only the institutions of democracy but also the ideas of the enlightenment.
</p>

<br>

<p>
 The conventional story of growth in Europe says that under autocracy, people are unwilling to make investments or engage in innovation because the political system does not provide adequate protection of property. The emergence of representative assemblies in Europe is said to have solved this problem. So how did the Chinese achieve growth without assemblies?
</p>

<p>
The Song dynasty was actually an age of increased centralization and personalization of power where administrative checks on the emperor diminished. Under China’s preceding dynasty, the Tang, emperors ruled as autocrats, but they also had to contend with and rely upon a class of prominent noble families. As we saw in chapter 6, the adoption during the Tang of a meritocratic exam undermined the great clans as did the series of fratricidal wars toward the dynasty’s end.23 Freeing themselves from clan politics, the first emperors of the Song relied on selection of bureaucrats through competitive examination. The Song emperors also established a system where officials were responsible directly to the emperor rather than to intermediate bodies.
</p>

<p>
Under Zhu Yuanzhang, the first emperor of the Ming dynasty, China pursued several policies that undermined the market economy. The first was to overissue its paper currency, the baochao, making producers reluctant to accept it as a medium of exchange.
</p>

<p>
According to one estimate, by the year 1393, 15 percent of China’s population had been displaced in this manner.27 This is an astonishingly high figure for a society that lacked modern means of transport; it attests to the very high coercive capacity of the Chinese state. One could hardly expect forced migration such as this to be good for economic development.28 Military and strategic considerations were at the heart of this decision.<br>

<p>
It turned out that, once again, autocratic leaders could promote learning and innovation, particularly in the early days. The difference with China was that autocratic rule under the Abbasids also proved very unstable, leading to diversion of resources into military conflict and away from investments 
</p>

<p>
The exact reason why the early Abbasid period was so unstable remains to be fully established. The more general point here may be that autocracies are particularly susceptible to this risk.<br>

 The episodes concerning
</p>

<p>
There is a venerable argument that European representative assemblies favored economic development because they usefully constrained rulers. This could distinguish Europe from other world regions. It could also distinguish England and the Dutch Republic from a state like France where assembly activity was much weaker. The big problem with this argument is that formalized representative assemblies became a prominent feature of the European landscape as 
</p>

<p>
The explanation I will offer here is that European representative assemblies both helped and hindered growth. By placing checks on rulers, assemblies prevented the sort of dramatic policy reversals seen in China under the Ming, but those who held power in assemblies could use their positions to block new market entrants. This has been argued with regard to city-states.40 The same argument could also apply to assemblies governing broader territories. By 1800, as Napoléon’s armies swept away the old, estates-based order in western Europe, many saw this as something that promoted economic development.41<br>
 European states with strong representative assemblies initially had higher 
</p>

<p>
If urbanization is a proxy for economic development, this fact is hard to reconcile with the idea that assemblies unambiguously favored growth. To show this we can make use of data that I collected for two previous studies.42 I will use this to sort individual European states into two groups: those that had a representative assembly with substantial prerogatives, including the ability to refuse new taxes, and those that either lacked an assembly or had an assembly with only weak prerogatives.
</p>

<br>

<p>
Existing arguments about European assemblies and growth do not adequately consider the Achilles’ heel of early democracy: those who control representative assemblies may restrict entry for new innovators. It’s very possible that this helped hinder development in Europe, even as representative regimes provided a degree of security of property for those on the inside.
</p>

<p>
In a polity like the Dutch Republic, a modern economy emerged, but it was ultimately held back by a distinctly premodern set of representative institutions that gave blocking power to local interests.
</p>

<p>
SINCE JOHN BRIGHT’S first reference to the “mother of parliaments” in 1865, many have argued that the English invented this political practice. The more accurate assessment is that the English invented a new kind of parliament. England was different because its rulers and people developed a style of governance that would evolve into modern democracy. 
</p>

<p>
A hundred also often included a sworn jury of twelve men to judge cases. The number twelve may be of Scandinavian origin—via the wapentake—possibly because in Norse mythology the gods themselves were twelve in number.
</p>

<p>
From the late tenth century onward, the shire was presided over by someone known as the shire reeve, or sheriff. The shire reeve would play a critical role not only in the administration of justice but also in raising revenue. The shire would itself also have a regular assembly, or shire court.
</p>

<p>
Ultimately, where Magna Carta was most important is in creating a focal point of agreement for future advocates of consensual government and the rule of law. It provides a particularly powerful illustration of how once an expectation of government by consent is codified, subsequent people can continually refer back to it. In the seventeenth century, amid attempts by Stuart monarchs to expand their prerogatives, Edward Coke could write about Magna Carta and the rights enshrined therein, as part of what many called Britain’s “ancient constitution.
</p>

<p>
There were many other European events that resembled Magna Carta, and this meant that supporters of consensual government elsewhere could also have a common rallying cry. J. C. Holt, the author of the authoritative history of Magna Carta, said precisely this: “the reiteration of the same story throughout western Europe carries obvious implications.”20 In an era where warfare was becoming ever costlier, monarchs found themselves compelled to work through assemblies composed of barons, members of the church, and representatives from towns. In 1188 King Alfonso IX of León was obliged to give important privileges to his vassals, and he did so in the context of a representative assembly called the cortes. In 1205 King Peter of Aragon drafted a document to do the same.21 In Hungary with the Golden Bull of 1222,

We saw in chapter 1 that around the year 1300—some eight decades after Magna Carta was agreed—King Edward I of England was able raise about 1 percent of GDP in revenue. This was slightly more than Philip the Fair of France was able to raise but not much more.

production from the Sawad of Iraq.24<br>
 The next thing we should do is ask how heavy King John’s exactions were in comparative terms. Figure 9.1 shows annual revenue figures during King John’s reign.25 These are expressed as a share of estimated English GDP.26 For purposes of
</p>

<p>
To judge how heavy these exactions were, we also need to compare King John’s exactions with what was going on in other societies around the globe, and here we see that even at its peak, revenue extraction under John was less than half of that in the Abbasid Caliphate and less than a third of that in Song China. These societies were able to maintain these rates of extraction without succumbing to a tax revolt.
</p>

<p>
Where England Really Did Pioneer: The Absence of Mandates<br>
 England was not exceptional because it had Parliament or because of the Magna Carta: it was the absence of mandates for parliamentary representatives that was different. Today we think of it as natural that in a democracy, representatives should not be bound by mandates imposed by their constituents. It is simply the way that things should be done. Representatives should instead have free rein to make laws as they see fit, and their constituents should then decide whether to reelect them. This is a British parliamentary legacy.
</p>

<p>
From the Anglo-Saxon period onward, English monarchs had achieved a degree of centralization that those on the continent could only envy. If one was to predict where mandates would disappear, you would say England, and in a way, this also means that modern democracy has a somewhat autocratic feel to it compared to early democracy.
</p>

<br>

<p>
 Despotism and Good Government
</p>

<p>
This illustrates the importance of sequencing. By the time of Henry’s accession, England had a well-oiled system of political representation, and in mobilizing during this period Parliament could draw upon this.
</p>

<p>
The final thing to recognize about 1688 is that, as Jack Goldstone has emphasized, William of Orange’s successful invasion was a highly contingent event that could have failed. If so, the story of modern democracy might have been different.50
</p>

<p>
the two faces of parliamentary supremacy. The first, positive face was that a parliament unburdened by local blocking interests could pass important economic legislation favoring development. The second, more negative, face was that a partisan executive could act in an autocratic and corrupt manner.
</p>

<br>

<p>
In the period of the Whig Supremacy (1715–60) about a third of these pertained to the economy or to improvements in communications. Most Acts in the former category were enclosure Acts, while most in the latter category involved the construction of turnpikes.
</p>

<p>
In other cases, Walpole used outright bribery to win elections and to solidify his parliamentary majority. In doing so some of the publications that he sponsored explicitly supported corruption. Corruption was said to be “a result of the present circumstances of the world, the natural condition of human affairs.”
</p>

<p>
It was ultimately the towns that had the power in this system.58 Individual towns bound their deputies to higher-level assemblies with strict mandates. In another characteristic of early democracy, there was a strong notion that each major town needed to agree to a proposal for it to pass, and they could opt out of measures with which they disagreed. Individual towns had the right to regulate trade, market entry, and even citizenship rights.59 Governance inside the towns of the Dutch Republic involved limited participation that tended to become increasingly oligarchic over time.
</p>

<p>
Several words of caution should be heard before we consider this problem. The first issue is that it is inevitably difficult to find an explanation for something that happened only once; only one country could be the first to industrialize. The second issue is that there are eminently plausible economic answers to the “Why England?” that have little to nothing to do with political institutions. Robert Allen, a prominent economic historian, has made the case that industrialization happened in England first because English wages were high, creating a demand for labor substitutes, and because available energy was cheap, creating the possibility of substitution once new technologies emerged.64 It was not because England had a parliament that there were coal deposits located near Manchester. Nor is it likely that high wages for laborers prevailed because of a Parliament that at the time was composed
</p>

<p>
The best case one could make for British political institutions is that a parliamentary regime helped create the space for the type of technical innovations—derived from experimental scientific knowledge—that allowed industrialization to take place.<br>
 As one measure

<p>
There is also an alternative variant to this story, recently proposed by Bas van Bavel.69 He argues that stagnation in the Dutch Republic was driven by the way that rising wealth inequality gave elites increased power to reshape political
</p>

<p>
This puzzle offers us an important opportunity to think about when democracy is possible.<br>
 Serious discussions of universal male suffrage in England began with the Revolution of the 1640s. The Revolution saw the development not only of radically egalitarian ideas but also of a potent new tool for coercion: the New Model Army.73 This was a form of military organization substantially more robust than the ad hoc militias that had preceded it, and in a sense it was the modern era’s first professional standing army. The problem was that if the New Model Army would prove effective at defeating the monarchy under Charles I, it would prove equally effective at stamping out the most ardent supporters of democracy within its own ranks.
</p>

<p>
By 1630 the forty-shilling restriction on voting in shire elections had been in place for two centuries. In a famous account of the 1630s and 1640s, the British Marxist historian Christopher Hill argued that England during these years witnessed substantial class antagonism fed by economic depression.78 In this environment radical clerics began contesting both crucial elements of church doctrine and established relationships between elites and masses. The emergence of the Levellers and the Diggers, two radical movements associated with the New Model Army, occurred around the same time. The Levellers focused primarily on issues of constitutional reform while the Diggers (who called themselves the True Levellers) advocated more direct efforts to establish economic equality.
</p>

<p>
One of the Leveller demands was to have frequent elections. This was a desire that British colonists in North America would subsequently share, as would the Anti-federalists in the debate over the U.S. Constitution.<br>
 A second Leveller demand involved a call for what amounted to near universal male suffrage. In their Agreement of the Free People of England, published on May 1, 1649, four Leveller leaders called for expanded suffrage along the following lines.

<p>
to understand the origins of democracy in America we need to realize that it wasn’t the intellectual developments of the late eighteenth century that produced it. Democracy in America emerged from earlier British ideas that were transplanted into a new environment. It was an environment where there was nothing resembling a state, where land was abundant relative to labor, and where those who sought to rule had no choice but to seek the consent of the governed. In other words, these are exactly the conditions where democracy would be expected to flourish.
</p>

<p>
I will show how the same underlying conditions that produced democracy for white colonists also encouraged the invention and expansion of chattel slavery.
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
. By altering the balance between rulers and ruled, these conditions pushed the colonists back to an earlier form of governance. The evidence fits Bailyn’s interpretation better, and it also fits closely with the explanations for early democracy that I have offered throughout this book.
</p>

<br>

<p>
For Bernard Bailyn, colonial assemblies were a British practice, refracted to reflect North American conditions. He expressed this idea in the following terms.
</p>

<p>
 What had taken place in the earlier years of colonial history was the partial re-creation, as a matter of fact and not of theory, of a kind of representation that had flourished in medieval England but that had faded and had been superseded by another during the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries.3
</p>

<p>
deliver potential migrants from among the ranks of the poor while also providing inducements for people to migrate voluntarily.<br>
 Sandys solicited local justices of the peace in England for youths of fifteen years and over who were “burdensome to the Parish where they live.” If the parish contributed five pounds sterling, the company would then organize for the transport of a youth to Virginia where—as it was put—they “shalbe entertayned in good manner as servants and apprentizes.”16 The end result for many was not very entertaining. Most of the arrivals at Jamestown during this period found a colony that was ill-equipped for large numbers, and they soon died from starvation, disease, or both.17<br>
 The second strategy Sandys pursued was to offer more favorable conditions in Virginia through land grants and democratic rights.
</p>

<p>
In Great Britain unskilled laborers had few political rights, but during the seventeenth century they experienced a steady increase in the wages received, and this affected the bargain that colonial American elites needed to offer to get them to migrate. From the early sixteenth century, wages for unskilled laborers in London rose continuously. By the beginnings of American colonization these wages were higher than in other European cities, and this divergence would only increase over time. Figure 10.2 shows this trend using welfare ratios that represent how far above the subsistence level a family with one wage earner would have been.
</p>

<p>
To entice people to migrate from Great Britain, colonial American wages obviously needed to be sufficiently high, and the data suggest that this was the case. Both in terms of nominal wages and welfare ratios, available evidence suggests that standards of living for unskilled laborers were similar in the colonies and in England.
</p>

<p>
Beyond high wages, the attraction of having the right to vote was another factor that was used to entice migrants to North America—high wages and political rights were complementary enticements. The political scientist Elena Nikolova and the economist Roger Congleton have each made this claim, and Nikolova has provided statistical evidence to support it.29 While seventeenth-century conditions pushed in favor of a very broad manhood suffrage, two eighteenth-century developments led to some backtracking. The first of these involved pressure from British royal authorities to regulate the suffrage. The second was that in the southern colonies, as the number of African slaves arriving increased
</p>

<p>
there was less incentive for elites to offer the suffrage to poor whites because they had less need for their labor.
</p>

<p>
we can see that the same underlying factor of labor scarcity contributed both to the granting of political rights to whites and to the enslavement of Africans. I make no claim here to be the first scholar to examine the links between American slavery and American freedom, as Edmund Morgan referred to it in the title of his 1975 book.32 What I want to instead suggest is that the foundations of both democracy and slavery in America fit with a broader theme that I have emphasized: the importance of land abundance (and consequent labor scarcity) and exit options.
</p>

<br>

<p>
the theory of labor coercion as presented by several economists. In 1970, an economist named Evsey Domar wrote an article titled “The Causes of Slavery or Serfdom” that neatly encapsulated an argument that some historians had made:
</p>

<p>
a condition of labor scarcity creates incentives for those who own land to develop coercive labor arrangements.33 In a nutshell, if we imagine a world where land and labor are the two factors of production, then if land is sufficiently abundant relative to labor, controlling a lot of land on its own will not be the route to wealth—you need to instead find a way to control people. Historians of precolonial Africa have often suggested that in an environment of land abundance, slavery naturally arose as an institution because controlling people was so valuable. But there’s a problem here. As we saw in chapters 2 and 3, it has also been argued by historians of precolonial Africa that land abundance led to early democracy. As long as people could move elsewhere, or so the story goes, then ruling in a coercive way was not feasible.
</p>

<p>
The question of when labor scarcity leads to coercion and when it instead leads to freedom has been answered by Daron Acemoglu and Alexander Wolitsky, two economists who present a theoretical model that expands upon Domar’s original insight.34 As Domar suggested, labor scarcity can lead to the development of more coercive labor arrangements because labor is more valuable. However, as labor scarcity increases, it also means that anyone forced by you to work may find that escape options elsewhere become more appealing. The final outcome depends on which one of the above two outcomes dominates—people who get enslaved are those who do not have a good “outside option.
</p>

<p>
individuals might be swooped up from the streets of London, sold out of orphanages to eager recruiters, or otherwise shipped off against their will. In some cases, the word “slave” was even used to refer to these individuals.35 So, on August 7, 1660, the employer of a servant named Ann Parker stood accused in Middlesex County Court in London of illegally selling her “for a slave to Virginia.” By the time Ann Parker was sold, Parliament had enacted punitive statutes against this practice, but those who were picked up on the streets of London and shipped to Virginia in earlier decades had no such legal protection, nor would Africans receive it until much, much later.
</p>

<p>
it did not always work that way. Once they finished their period of indenture, many English migrants established farms of their own. This exit option must have been facilitated by the fact that they looked like Virginia’s existing British colonists, and they also sounded like them. They would have also shared a host of other cultural commonalities. In other words, they had a good outside option.<br>
 Now consider the case of Africans in Virginia, Maryland, and the other British colonies in North America who began arriving in 1619. The earliest African arrivals to Virginia and Maryland came in a variety of situations. Some were free and remained so, some were indentured under term contracts analogous to those of many white migrants, and some came entirely unfree.37 Outside options also mattered for Africans, and for several obvious reasons they were much worse than those for white migrants.
</p>

<p>
Africans looked different than English people, they most often would not have arrived speaking English, or being aware of English cultural practices, and there is plenty of evidence that people in Elizabethan and Jacobean England associated dark skin with inferiority or other negative qualities.38 Outside options for Africans were remote to nonexistent.
</p>

<p>
The sustainability of slavery in colonies like Virginia and Maryland depended on Africans not being able to escape and find labor elsewhere. For slave owners it of course helped that they had the law on their side. This law evolved quickly to define exactly what a “slave” was, there having been no prior juridical definition of the term. Africans were now to be slaves whereas kidnapped British boys were bound by “the custom of the country,” meaning that eventual release could be expected.
</p>

<p>
We can now see how an environment of land abundance and labor scarcity led simultaneously to greater political rights for white migrants and to enslavement for Africans. But to understand slavery’s expansion we need to consider a further factor: the rise of tobacco. It was the dramatic increase in British demand for tobacco that would lead to an equally dramatic expansion of slavery in Maryland and Virginia.40<br>
 John Rolfe, the future husband of Pocahontas, is by tradition thought to have been the first white settler to successfully cultivate tobacco in Virginia. He did so with a strain from Trinidad that was both sweeter and higher in nicotine than local varieties grown by Native Americans.
</p>

<p>
1665 in London, the idea became widespread that smoking tobacco would protect an individual from the disease. Even schoolchildren were ordered to smoke, and in one oft-repeated story that is perhaps apocryphal, a boy at Eton College was whipped for not smoking. All this would have further increased demand for Virginian tobacco.
</p>

The case of the colony of Georgia provides us with a final example of how land abundance and labor scarcity produced American slavery.42 Georgia was the last of the thirteen British colonies in mainland North America to be established. This took place through a royal charter granted in 1732. The men who established Georgia took the surprising initial step of banning the use of African slaves in the colony.
</p>

<p>
The stated motivation was that the colony was to be settled by poor individuals from England who sought a better life. Reliance on African slaves would only reduce the industriousness of these people. Moral concerns about whether it was actually acceptable to treat Africans in this manner do not seem to have entered into the picture. The outlawing of slavery was combined with a pattern of land tenure that was intended to maintain a high labor-to-land ratio. Land grants to individual settlers were limited to fifty acres.<br>
 The prohibition of slavery in Georgia did not last very long. By 1735 a group of individual landowners emerged known as the “malcontents.” Using cold financial logic, they argued that even though the price of an indentured servant from England was cheaper than that for an African slave, use of slaves made more economic sense.
</p>

<p>
Slaves also had lower costs of subsistence. Finally, the value of an indentured servant depreciated more quickly, not only because their contract might run out but also because English indentured servants tended to die at a much faster rate than African slaves.<br>
 By the summer of 1750 the trustees who had hoped to make Georgia a free colony gave up their effort—settlers were free to use African slaves.
</p>

<p>
Latin America in Comparison<br>
 The bargaining position of European settlers in Spanish America was fundamentally weaker than it was in the British colonies; as a result, there was no comparable story of extensive political rights being granted. In England at the time of colonization wages were high and rising while in Spain at the same time they were low and stagnant, so there was less need to offer political rights to attract ordinary Spanish migrants. We can show this by comparing subsistence ratios calculated by Robert Allen and his colleagues.43 A subsistence ratio of one means that the wage of an unskilled worker is just sufficient for providing a family’s basic caloric needs.
</p>

<p>
seventeenth century the subsistence ratio for unskilled workers in London was just under three whereas in Valencia in Spain it was less than two. During the course of the century the London subsistence ratio rose to more than four whereas in Valencia it stagnated.<br>
 The other major difference between North and South America was the abundance and organization of “native” labor.44 There is considerable debate about population densities in the Americas before 1492. Recent archaeologically based estimates suggest that the part of North America excluding Mesoamerica had a population of between one and six million people.45 In South America the Inka Empire alone is estimated to have had ten to twelve million people.46 In Mesoamerica the Aztec Empire alone is estimated to have had three to four million people.
</p>

<p>
When conquering the Inkas, the Spanish could simply dispense with the top level of rulers while, at least at first, maintaining the underlying bureaucracy. Any attempt to do something similar with the Huron or the Iroquois would have simply resulted in them melting off into the forest. Once again, inheriting a bureaucratic state and practices pushed things away from democracy.<br>
 Even after the introduction of European
</p>

<p>
 early as 1647, the king of France had agreed that the inhabitants of the three towns of Québec, Montréal, and Trois-Rivières should be allowed to elect representatives, called syndics, who would attend meetings of the governing council. This council otherwise consisted only of officials appointed by the king. The rationale for this development appears to have been the same that we have seen on many other occasions: lacking much means of coercion, the only way to govern the local population was to seek their assistance.
</p>

<p>
What the Federalists did was put the United States firmly on the track of modern democracy instead of early democracy. One view is that the constraints posed on democracy through the Constitution were intellectually motivated. Classical scholars, such as Polybius, had argued for a “mixed constitution” that blended democratic, aristocratic, and monarchical elements, and his influence on the U.S. Founding Fathers was clear.52 The opposite view, staked out most famously by Charles Beard in 1913, is that this was a movement driven primarily by economic interest. A group of those with property and commercial interests sought a set of institutions that would defend their position.53 While Beard was subsequently criticized for overreaching, events in the newly independent United States during the 1780s do give us examples where those who would become the backbone of the Federalist movement
</p>

<p>
The Federalists argued that the practice of mandates destroyed any possibility for deliberation between representatives. Also, mandates would tend to be used when the passions of the people were most inflamed. Anti-federalists saw mandates as a necessary check on the abuse of power. 
</p>

<p>
Anti-federalists like Elbridge Gerry advocated incorporating mandates as part of the First Amendment. The right to free speech should include speech that would bind representatives. The Federalist majority in the House of Representatives rejected this proposal.<br>
 The United States was not the only country to take a decisive move away from mandates at this time. In France in meetings of the Estates General it was common for constituencies to bind their deputies with strict instructions. As we saw in chapter 5, attempts by monarchs to have deputies given full powers proved largely ineffectual. In 1789 the Estates General had not met since 1614 though assemblies in some provinces had continued to meet. As part of the process each district or baillage that sent a representative to the Estates of 1789
</p>

<p>
one of the first decisions taken by the French revolutionaries in July 1789 was to abolish mandates.<br>
 The decision of the Estates General of 1789, and of subsequent representative bodies, to renounce the idea of mandates or instructions met with majority, but far from total, support. For the Abbé de Sieyès, the idea that an individual constituency could bind their representative with a mandate was fundamentally incompatible with the idea that the deputy should have the national interest first in mind. For others, the use of mandates was critical for ensuring that it was the people who actually governed. The most outspoken supporter of the continued use of mandates was Jean-François Varlet, a member of the group known as the enragés.
</p>

<p>
Varlet saw the importance of mandates in the following terms:
</p>

<p>
 In a country where the people are everything, the first act of sovereignty is to elect, the second is to give powers and mandates to those who are elected.56
</p>

<p>
 Was the abandonment of mandates under modern democracy a good thing for the average citizen? We generally take their absence today for granted, but there have been examples on both the right and left where people have proposed bringing them back. If we think about this in abstract terms, the advantage of a mandate is that it does not matter whom you choose as a representative; the disadvantage is that it makes it harder for representatives to respond
</p>

<p>
. A system without mandates like this, where deviation is possible, will be more preferable the greater the certainty that a representative shares their views and the greater the ability of the public to learn about the true state of affairs.<br>
 Does the above abstract framework help us understand why and when mandates were abandoned? I think not. Whether we are talking about a British monarch in 1339, American Federalists in 1787, or French Revolutionaries in 1789, the abandonment of mandates can best be understood as a struggle between a center and localities with the center succeeding in imposing its will. 
</p>

<p>
Today the Anti-federalist idea that elections should be held annually seems odd and unrealistic. In federal and state elections today, representatives and executives are chosen for terms ranging from two to six years. But to put this into perspective, we need to remember that the system the Anti-federalists sought was simply that which had prevailed in most of the colonial legislatures.
</p>

<p>
Other speakers remarked that the Septennial Act had placed undue distance between constituents and representatives in Great Britain. Therefore, this was not an example to be followed.58<br>
 In laying out the Federalist position James Madison took a very different view. He argued that in an extensive republic it would take time for legislators to learn about the interests of states other than their own. He argued further that instability had always been the problem of republics. For elections to the Senate, Madison went even further. William L. Pierce had argued in favor of a three-year term, and he did this on the basis of the fact that the Septennial Act in England—which had lengthened the parliamentary term from three to seven years—had caused “great mischiefs.” Madison initially argued for a seven-year term for the Senate.
</p>

<p>
Just as mandates and annual elections seem unnatural to us today, the idea that the Constitution would not give the federal government substantial power to tax seems equally implausible. Strong central state power is a core feature of modern democracy. But from the standpoint of 1787, this was not a natural or obvious outcome. The Anti-federalists, historical examples in hand, argued that giving the federal government the power to levy taxes would risk resulting in tyranny. That is not what happened in the end, but to see the depth of these anxieties we need to recognize that they persisted well after 1787.
</p>

<p>
There was a concern that while the Constitution held representatives at a distance from their constituents, financial interests in New York and Philadelphia would have no problem influencing Congress. John Taylor, a Virginia politician who was a close friend of Thomas Jefferson, described the problem in the following terms. Writing in 1794, he distinguished between the “5,000,000,” which was thought to be the population of the United States at this time, and the “5,000,” the moneyed elite that would have great influence. In U.S. political debates today, we would refer to this group as the top 0.1 percent.
</p>

<br>
<br>
<br>

<p>
the 5,000,000 are only allowed once in two years, a kind of political spasm, and after one day’s mockery of importance, sink again into its lethargy. A nominal election of, and an irresistible influence over the Legislature, are things of real difference.
</p>

<p>
The Constitution of 1787 on its own did not assure the survival of democracy in America. It even posed a problem to the extent that citizens were now governed by a very distant state. Some citizens in the Early Republic saw the problem: keeping citizens connected with a distant state would require substantial effort and investment. One such investment was subsidizing the circulation of newspapers so that people could inform themselves.
</p>

<p>
The writers of the Federalist Papers were slow to recognize the importance of keeping the public connected with government and therefore trustful of it. In his contributions to the Federalist Papers, James Madison did not write very extensively about public opinion, nor did John Jay or Alexander
</p>

<p>
The phrase “public opinion” appears in the Federalist Papers only five times and on each occasion only in passing. After 1789, Alexander Hamilton argued for a submissive role for the public. Public opinion was important to the extent that citizens should decide whether they had confidence in government, but the citizenry was not to play a more active role.
</p>

<p>
In his essay titled “Public Opinion,” written in December 1791, he now spoke of the constraints posed by large size. Madison argued that promoting the circulation of newspapers would be one way to address the constraint of scale.
</p>

<p>
 The larger a country, the less easy for its real opinion to be ascertained, and the less difficult to be counterfeited; when ascertained or presumed, the more respectable it is in the eyes of individuals. This is favorable to the authority of government. For the same reason, the more extensive a country, the more insignificant is each individual in his own eyes. This may be unfavorable to liberty.<br>
 Whatever facilitates a general intercourse of sentiments, as good roads, domestic commerce, a free press, and particularly a circulation of newspapers through the entire body of the people,
</p>

<p>
James Madison’s essay appeared as the United States Congress was debating the passage of a Postal Service Act. In congressional debate the question arose whether the postal system ought to be used to subsidize the delivery of newspapers. In countries like the United Kingdom, the general rule was to use the postal service to raise revenue, not to subsidize shipments. In the United States, congressional sentiment weighed in favor of subsidizing newspapers so that the public could better inform itself. But the question then arose of which newspapers should be subsidized.
</p>

<p>
It is clear from this evidence that the Early Republic witnessed a dramatic increase in the number of newspapers in circulation. At the end of the Revolutionary War in 1783 there were 75 newspapers in circulation. By 1820 this number had increased nearly tenfold to 629.
</p>

<br>

<p>
We see further evidence for the importance of newspapers in the United States soon after the Postal Service Act of 1792 with the following comment from the French observer Jean-Esprit Bonnet: “They arrive in the most far off places once a week; secondary towns have them two days a week; and large cities have them morning, noon, and night.”66<br>
 The ability to ship newspapers for a penny helped keep citizens in the Early Republic informed about their government. But in some cases, it also helped keep people misinformed.
</p>

<p>
 1788, amid the debate over the ratification of the Constitution, Ben Franklin wrote a letter to the editors of the Pennsylvania Gazette in which he pretended to take the view of a European observer who, laid up by gout, had decided to amuse himself by reading a packet of newspapers from the state of Pennsylvania. The observer described his impression of American politics in a way that, with the switch of a few labels, could easily fit with American politics in our current polarized era.
</p>

<p>
 For I learn from those Papers, that your state is divided into Parties, that each Party ascribes all the public Operations of the other to vicious Motives; that they do not even suspect one another of the Smallest Degree of Honesty;
</p>

<p>
If the new penny newspapers could propagate fiction as easily as the truth, then how can we claim that their existence helped solidify democracy? Shouldn’t we think that the effect was in fact the opposite much as some think of the effect of social media today? To answer these two questions, we need to first ask another: the penny newspapers compared to what else? Compared to a world where there are multiple newspapers, none of which engage in muckraking or slander, the performance of the penny press might seem subpar. But recall that while James Madison wrote in general terms about public opinion, people like Elbridge Gerry had a more specific fear in mind: the idea that the Federalist administration would establish something akin to a “court gazette” and that this would be the sole source that many people would have about the affairs of government.
</p>

<p>
far better to have access to multiple news sources even if they were biased; even biased news sources could provide some information.
</p>

<p>
During the colonial period, the same forces that had pushed toward consensual governance for Native Americans did the same for European colonists. Land abundance, ease of exit, and the absence of coercive state power all made consensual governance a necessity. Colonial assemblies emerged to help levy taxes and to administer justice. A broad manhood suffrage arose not because of some concrete plan, project, or philosophy but for the simple reason that there were few initial differences among colonists upon which to base a more restrictive system. The suffrage also became a means of attracting people. These forces pushed in the direction of democracy as long as you were a European settler. In an environment of labor scarcity, the alternative strategy was to rely on forced laborers who could be easily distinguished from the European population and who had no good exit
</p>

<p>
We can now consider whether the same factors that we have seen in the first ten chapters can help explain the global spread of democracy. Modern democracy has been more likely to take root in places where there is a legacy of state weakness and where rulers need their people. Prior traditions of collective governance have also mattered.
</p>

<p>
 Charting the Spread of Democracy
</p>

<p>
FIGURE 11.1. The rise of modern democracy. Calculated and presented by Our World in Data based on data from the Polity IV database. Democracies here are those with a combined Polity score of six or higher.
</p>

<p>
. One of the factors leading to democracy in Europe was something that we have encountered elsewhere in the book: in an environment of mass mobilization for war, rulers needed their people,
</p>

<p>
For this second wave I will concentrate on one main question: Why did democratic governance not emerge in China and Russia while it became firmly anchored in India? Long-run legacies of state development help explain the divergence.
</p>

<p>
In the third section of this chapter I will ask how it is that numerous African countries have become democracies since this date. According to just about any conventional political science theory, African countries should not be democracies today. They are too poor, too divided, and too unequal to sustain this form of governance. The actual outcome in a number of African states has been rather different.
</p>

<p>
 we study Figure 11.1, we do need to also make sure not to fall into a trap. This would be to suggest that democracy started off in one place before expanding globally. This was true of modern democracy but not early democracy. As we have seen throughout this book, many peoples in many areas that Europeans colonized had their own forms of early democracy—it just happened that they got colonized by Europeans who then imposed non-democratic rule from afar. Were we able to chart this movement in full and adopt a broader definition of democracy we would conclude that the initial share of people living under some form of democracy actually started out quite high.
</p>

<p>
The spread of democracy in Europe involved several successive developments. In those cases where they had weakened, representative assemblies were reinvigorated. In many cases these assemblies bore the same name as their medieval counterparts. Having a prior base to build on helps explain why this could happen. Subsequently, assemblies began to accumulate more power to the point where they became the central basis of government, and this too represented a return to medieval precedent. The final achievement of democracy involved the establishment of universal suffrage, including for women, and competitive elections. We need to ask why all this happened.
</p>

<p>
An Expanding Blaze of Ideas?<br>
 The simplest explanation for the arrival of democracy in Europe is that the American Revolution was based on a set of radical new ideas about political equality, and this proved to be a very powerful message. This was a fire that once lit spread into what one historian has recently called an “expanding blaze.
</p>

<p>
shortcoming to this story: for the vast majority of European states there was a long hiatus between the spread of American ideas and the adoption of universal suffrage. We could say the same thing with regard to the spread of French revolutionary ideas.<br>
 We saw in chapter 9 that the ideas of political equality of the American colonists had been seen in other places at other times. In the 1640s in England the Levellers and the Diggers had experimented with exactly the same ideas of a broad manhood suffrage. But by the time they got to the point of writing these ideas down, the Leveller leaders were imprisoned in the Tower of London. The environmental conditions of North America were much more amenable to seeing a broad suffrage be adopted. It may be that this needed to happen first before democratic practices could spread to Europe.
</p>

<br>
<br>
<br>

<p>
Economists and political scientists have spilled much ink trying to ascertain whether higher per capita income and the things with which it is associated really do drive democracy. Here I want to propose a simpler approach that will return to Seymour Martin Lipset’s first work on this subject from 1959. Lipset compared democracies and dictatorships in Europe and Latin America
</p>

<p>
In 1870 French income per capita was only $2,383 in today’s dollars. That’s about the same GDP per capita as Tanzania or Senegal today, and in France in 1870 there were of course no telephones, radios, or motor vehicles.<br>
 France in 1870 became a stable democracy in spite of being a poor developing country, and it was hardly unique in doing so. Among a set of thirteen western European countries, the average per capita income at which they democratized was a little over $3,000.9 Four of the countries in this set were actually poorer than France when they democratized. Also, a number of these countries became stable democracies prior to the invention or diffusion of the technologies for communication and transport that many see as critical for democracy.
</p>

<p>
even monarchs like Louis XIV still found it necessary to bargain with their subjects. As just one example, a number of French provinces retained assemblies that played an important role in levying taxes. Julian Swann has demonstrated this extensively for the Estates General of Burgundy, which helped the Crown raise taxes and therefore also had a role in consenting to them.14 These same Estates also provided loans to the French monarchs.15 The Estates General of Burgundy was far from unique in playing this role.16 All this suggests that outside of the Prussian case, European absolutism is better seen as an idea than as a description of a firmly anchored practice.<br>
 To sum things up, by the time that the
</p>

<p>
early democracy is a human invention and not a specifically European one. But there were two ways in which Europeans prior to 1800 did innovate. This was through the use of formalized elections and with the establishment of assemblies covering large geographic distances. The prior development of both of these technologies meant that by the time the American Revolution happened, part of the infrastructure for modern democracy was already in place. This was very unlike other regions—such as the Middle East—where early democracy existed at the local level
</p>

<p>
In addition to their assembly tradition, by the time of the American Revolution, Europeans had also been practicing formalized voting for centuries. It just happened that this was much more common at the local level than at the national level. Within the Catholic Church, a large, sprawling organization, considerable efforts were made to elaborate a theory of voting and of majority and supermajority rule as the political scientist Melissa Schwartzberg has shown.
</p>

<p>
It is true that Europeans were not the only ones to develop the practice of voting and of voting by majority. During the Kamakura period in Japan (1185–1333) monastic groups governed themselves collectively, and they did so with a principle of majority rule.20 But it is not clear that examples such as this had the same durability that they did in Europe.<br>
 The other way in which Europeans innovated was in developing an explicit theory of representation that was applied to governance over large territories. Some larger polities outside Europe did maintain councils, but the constraints of geographic scale were apparent, such as when Ashanti
</p>

<p>
Elsewhere I have noted that the frequency of meetings of assemblies was closely correlated with geographic scale.21 This meant that assemblies could only play a truly active role in governance, such as by managing spending, in relatively small polities. But geographic scale was less of an obstacle to having an assembly consent to taxation, since this occurred at less frequent intervals.22 The most extreme example of this was the Fourth Lateran Council of 1213–15 where Pope Innocent III convened representatives from throughout Europe in an effort to gain consent for revenues.
</p>

<p>
Historical precedents involving voting and assemblies help explain why modern democracy spread to Europe, but they cannot explain the timing of its adoption. While many factors may have played a role here, in what follows I want to investigate one in particular. Throughout this book, I have emphasized that democracy is more likely to emerge when rulers need their people. In the nineteenth century this dynamic reemerged. Interstate competition and technological changes, and in particular the development of railroads, made the mobilization of mass armies both necessary and possible.23 This could best be done through universal conscription, and that could best be obtained if people had the right to vote.
</p>

<p>
in 1901 the Swedish government obtained passage of a law establishing universal conscription for all men. This would soon give Sweden’s Social Democrats, a minority party, a new rallying cry, “one man, one gun, one vote.” Just as ancient Athenians had thought it necessary to allow the thetes a greater political role because it was they who rowed the boats, this was the same argument some twenty-five centuries later. Hjalmar Branting, who would go on to be Sweden’s first Social Democratic prime minister, went as far as to say that “the right to vote is Sweden’s prime defense issue.” Sweden adopted universal manhood suffrage in 1909, and there is little doubt that the conscription argument helped pave the way for this change.
</p>

<p>
simple principle that for one thing to cause another thing, it needs to precede it. When we untangle the relationship between universal conscription and universal suffrage in this way, we see a very interesting result. Early adoption of universal conscription increases the likelihood that a government will subsequently adopt universal manhood suffrage. The reverse is less true. Say that a country adopts universal conscription but it does not yet have universal manhood suffrage. There is a 23 percent greater chance of adopting universal manhood suffrage in the next five years than would otherwise be the case.27 Now consider the case where a country has already adopted universal suffrage but it has not yet adopted universal conscription. Here there is only a 4 percent greater chance of adopting universal conscription within the next five years.
</p>

<p>
FIGURE 11.2. One man, one gun, one vote. The figure shows the fraction of a set of twenty countries by year that had universal and equal male suffrage and that had universal conscription. (See the text for sources.
</p>

<p>
There was one European country where the one man, one gun, one vote principle did not apply, and that was autocratic Prussia. The Prussian government first began contemplating a system of universal conscription after the devastating losses it suffered against Napoléon and his French armies. The French ideas of the levée en masse and the citizen soldier provided a powerful example. We know for a fact that some Prussian councillors favored adopting the French model.
</p>

<p>
Army’s chief of staff proposed that generalized military service could only work if citizens were granted a free constitution, the franchise, and the ability to hold those in power to account. This advice was ignored by King Friedrich Wilhelm III. He chose to instead implement a more limited reform by banning some of the gruesome disciplinary punishments for which the Prussian Army was known.30 As was the case in other autocracies, such as those in Warring States China, conscription in Prussia was enforced by bureaucracy rather than gaining compliance by granting political rights.
</p>

<p>
In a famous contribution published in 1891, Moisey Ostrogorski, the early Russian sociologist and political scientist, argued that within Europe, political power of women at the local level in “primitive and medieval communities” was extinguished by the establishment of higher-level governance. Looking at local communities, and in particular those with some communal forms of property, Ostrogorski provided examples of cases where women had played a prominent political role. As governance shifted from spontaneous forms of association to a more structured and uniform rule, women lost what political role they had enjoyed.
</p>

<br>

<p>
Some twentieth-century historical work suggested that women played a powerful role in Anglo-Saxon society, only to lose prominence after the Norman conquest. More recent work suggests this picture was oversimplified because it was based on evidence only for elites. A more accurate picture would seem to be that ordinary women in later Anglo-Saxon England did have some influence, but in the early Anglo-Saxon period non-elite women were essentially property.
</p>

<p>
Both the Swedish and the English cases suggest a link between a government’s need for someone’s resources (paid through taxes) and the granting of political rights. The next big question is whether female participation in the war efforts of the twentieth century hastened the arrival of female suffrage as it had done for men. Here the answer seems to be maybe, but not for the reasons we might think.
</p>

<p>
In the wake of World War I, Denmark, the Netherlands, and Sweden all established full female suffrage. This gives a strong sense then that while women’s war efforts may have mattered, it was also true that the end of a large-scale war offered a new opening to reform movements in general.
</p>

<br>

<p>
remaining possibility for women’s suffrage is that its emergence may also have depended on what we might call “normal” politics, for lack of a better term. The political scientist Dawn Teele has recently demonstrated that when existing leaders thought that their party’s vote share would benefit disproportionately from extending the suffrage to women, they pushed for this reform.
</p>

<p>
In some states in the western portion of the United States, such as Wyoming, the pressure to attract female residents to an area where there were six adult men for every adult woman pushed male elites to grant female suffrage considerably earlier than happened elsewhere in the United States.
</p>

<p>
There is one final important reason for the spread of democracy in Europe. Over time, European elites learned that they had less to fear from democracy than they had originally believed.
</p>

<br>

<p>
mass enfranchisement might entail a wholesale expropriation of property. “Democracy” itself was a dirty word. But as more and more countries acquired democratic experience, the anticipated cataclysm did not take place. Ultimately, the fact that democracy posed less danger to elites than initially feared may have helped ensure its continued existence.<br>
 Evidence on progressive taxation shows that democracy alone did not produce massive redistribution. In an initial series of democratic revolts in 1848, participants had called for establishing top tax rates that would see the richest members of society pay fully half of their income in tax.36 The democratic revolutions of 1848 were too brief to see such plans implemented, but we can still use these revolutions as a gauge to compare them with what happened once democracy arrived for good.
</p>

<p>
But the average top marginal rate of income taxation in Europe was still in the single digits, and data on inheritance tax rates tell a very similar story.37 Prior to 1914 the advance of democracy failed to produce a general move to redistribute income or wealth through the tax system. It was only subsequently—in an environment of mass warfare when new demands were made on individuals—that steeply progressive tax systems would be adopted.
</p>

<p>
There might be pressures to cut consumption taxes even if this sparked a government default. For most of Europe, nothing of the sort happened. To see this, we can look at bond yields. In Great Britain yields on British Consols rose in anticipation of the 1832 act that expanded the franchise, but they quickly returned to the same level afterward. Aditya Dasgupta and Daniel Ziblatt have shown that yield spikes in advance of subsequent suffrage reform acts proved to be successively smaller—wealth holders were learning that democracy was posing less danger than they had feared.
</p>

<p>
what we know about the evolution of wealth inequality before and after the expansion of the suffrage. Economists often measure wealth inequality by estimating what percent of a country’s total wealth is held by the top 1 percent
</p>

<p>
Since France was among the first countries to adopt a modern inheritance tax, the French data provide us with a particularly long-run view of wealth inequality before, during, and after the expansion of the suffrage.<br>
 Figure 11.3 shows the evolution of wealth inequality in France, with records beginning in 1810. At that time the top 1 percent of individuals in France controlled 46 percent of their country’s wealth. France had a brief experiment with universal suffrage with the Second Republic, beginning in 1848, but this was too brief a period for us to expect democracy to have done much to move the wealth distribution.
</p>

<p>
FIGURE 11.3. Wealth inequality and universal suffrage in France. This figure is from Scheve and Stasavage 2017 drawing on wealth inequality data reported in Piketty 2014.
</p>

<p>
The experience of the Third Republic provides us with a better test of the effect of universal suffrage on wealth inequality. Universal suffrage was adopted at the Republic’s establishment in 1870 and maintained continuously until its end in 1940. During the first four decades of the republic, wealth inequality rose from 50 to 60 percent. It was only long afterward that wealth inequality entered into a steady decline, so that at the time of France’s defeat by Germany in 1940, the top 1 percent’s share of national wealth had shrunk to a little more than a third.
</p>

<p>
wealth inequality did eventually fall, but the timing of this seemed to have little to do with when universal suffrage was achieved.41 What seems to have mattered more for wealth inequality was the series of dislocations created by two world wars and the Great Depression. In a context of mass mobilization for war it was possible for the political left to create new fairness-based arguments for steeply progressive taxation. If labor was to be conscripted, then the same should be true of capital.42 Wars and economic depression also led to unanticipated inflation that substantially ate into the real value of existing fortunes. This was true for holders of government debt in particular.
</p>

<p>
There are two very different ways of explaining the failure of universal suffrage to influence the wealth distribution. The first way emphasizes some form of elite capture of democracy. The other way is to suggest that parties of the left who proposed measures to reduce inequality did not understand what many voters wanted.<br>
 France, once again, provides us with an instructive case. In 1848, urban uprisings in Paris led to the overthrow of King Louis Philippe’s regime. In its place a Second Republic was decreed, to follow the First Republic that had briefly existed during the French Revolution. For the legislative election of 1849 parties of the left proposed a “social republic” that would have implemented policies to reduce inequality.44

The downfall of the Second Republic was produced by mutual incomprehension between urban and rural groups. The Parisian liberals and working-class groups who led the insurrections made little effort to understand the motivations of the French peasantry,
</p>

<p>
To the extent they did try to understand them, the French peasantry was described as being afflicted by “rural imbecility.”45 This sense of rural ignorance was fed by the incomprehension at peasants voting “against their own interest” to elect a majority of the right. It was fed further by the fact that some areas that had voted for Louis-Napoléon in December then voted for the left in the spring, or vice versa. If Hillary Clinton in 2016 referred to some supporters of Donald Trump as “deplorables,” then we might refer to the French peasants of 1849 who voted in a right-wing majority as the “original deplorables.”<br>
 The first failure of urban elites seems to have been that while they proposed some policies that could have benefited the peasantry, they ignored others.
</p>

<p>
question of comprehensive agrarian reform was largely ignored. This could have involved road building, irrigation projects, and efforts to reform rural credit markets.
</p>

<p>
This was the case of Pierre Joseph Proudhon, who argued that fifty years of education would be necessary before the peasantry could vote. Otherwise, they were thought to have the same status as children.49 There is an eerie parallel with observations like this and current proposals in the United States to establish an “epistocracy” where only those with knowledge can vote.
</p>

<p>
The lesson of France’s Second Republic is that a democratic society is rarely divided on a simple cleavage between those with wealth and those without, the sort of possibility so feared by America’s Founding Fathers. It is instead the case that other cleavages get in the way. In the French case it was a stark difference between rural and urban areas, something that is salient in many countries today.
</p>

<p>
. As we consider each of these developments we should also keep one other thing in mind: despite lacking the institutions of modern democracy, from Mao Zedong forward, China’s leaders have made very frequent reference to “democracy”—minzhu in direct translation. If China does ever “democratize” this may occur less with the establishment of multiparty elections than with other practices that make the ruling party increasingly beholden to public opinion.
</p>

<p>
It would be hard to attribute the problems of the Beiyang government to a failure of design because the constitution was directly modeled on existing examples from western Europe and the United States. Power was to be held by an assembly, a president, ministers, and courts. Members of the assembly were to be selected by each province with the selection method determined locally. A president and vice president were themselves to be elected by the assembly. The president would then choose ministers who would govern. This was all a direct import of a model that had proved durable elsewhere.<br>
 The bigger reason for the failure of the Beiyang government is that it is difficult to establish governance by assembly in a setting where there is no history of doing things this way.
</p>

<p>
land reform that dispossessed rural elites of their wealth.52 This clearly differed drastically from republican governance in the 1911 period where existing landed elites retained power. It also fits with a surprising—and more general—pattern identified by the political scientist Michael Albertus. It turns out that autocratic governments are more likely to implement land reforms than are democratic governments.53 At least in this way, the “democracy” proclaimed by Mao was more successful at generating redistribution than were many elected democratic governments, but in this case land reform came with very substantial violence and death.<br>
 Despite overturning China’s old order, 
</p>

<p>
When the Chinese Communist Party assumed power in 1949, Mao Zedong made the following declaration about state power. Stating that the ultimate goal of the Communists was to abolish state power, he emphasized that in the short term it would need to be reinforced.
</p>

<p>
Don’t you want to abolish state power?” Yes, we do, but not right now; we cannot do it yet. Why? Because imperialism still exists, because classes still exist in our country. Our present task is to strengthen the people’s state apparatus—mainly the people’s army, the people’s police and the people’s courts—in order to consolidate the national defence and protect the people’s interests.54
</p>

<p>
A Commercial Revolution Did Not Bring Consensual Government
</p>

<p>
The parallels between those earlier revolutions and today can help us to better understand China’s recent non-democratization. Recall that during the Song dynasty, China saw a substantial increase in urbanization as well as the introduction of new technologies for communication. The rapid expansion of woodblock printing allowed for improved communication and diffusion of knowledge. But this did not result in the sort of political change that printing is thought to have generated in Europe. What happened instead was that the Chinese state promoted the use of printing to spread technical knowledge while at the same time monitoring all publications to prevent the spread of disagreeable political ideas. Recent years have seen a repeat of the exact phenomenon with the Internet and social media.
</p>

<p>
contrary to the expectations of many Western observers of several decades ago, allowing the diffusion of knowledge necessary for innovation and development does not have to also be accompanied by openness to the spread of alternative political ideas. So far, it is an open question how long this can be maintained. Ten years ago, those who wrote about the effect of Internet penetration in China suggested that official censorship was repeatedly undermined by the ability of ordinary citizens to find new and surprising forms of protest. Guobin Yang in 2009 referred to this as “a world of carnival, community, and contention in and through cyberspace.”58 More recent accounts, such as that by Margaret Roberts, have been decidedly less optimistic.
</p>

<p>
The Chinese Communist Party Has Repeatedly Referred to Democracy<br>
 In spite of all the features that prompt many to think of the current Chinese government as an autocracy, since 1949 and before Chinese Communist leaders have repeatedly used the word “democracy,” or minzhu, when referring to how they govern.60 When Mao wrote about democracy at the outset of the People’s Republic, he followed writers of Marxist inspiration in differentiating between a “bourgeois democracy” of the sort that they thought existed in the West and a “people’s democracy” of the sort he sought to establish.61 So what sort of importance should we attach to the idea of a people’s democracy? Has it had any meaning in China or might it have meaning one day?
</p>

<p>
 it does not involve elections contested by political parties. Nor does it involve an assembly that actually places a real check on a country’s executive. On paper China does have just such an institution, the National People’s Congress, but the people who constructed the Standard Cross Cultural Sample would not have coded this as an example of governance by council, because there is little evidence that this body presents a check on executive authority.<br>
 The remaining possibility is that a people’s democracy involves some sort of broad popular participation in governance but without having elections. When prompted with the idea that democracy should primarily be about elections, one protesting Chinese student in 1989 said that they instead thought of “Rousseau and the model of direct
</p>

<p>
 is clear today that there are many institutionalized venues through which the Chinese government seeks input from members of society—the question is whether it listens.
</p>

<p>
Russia’s Failure to Democratize<br>
 Imperial Russia presents the main example, after China, of a large power that failed to democratize during the twentieth century, excepting if one considers a brief period after 1991, and even then, the change was only temporary. The interesting fact about Russia is that on the surface, the preconditions would seem to have been almost the exact opposite of those in China. Russia lacked the intensive high-yield agriculture that favored the bureaucratic alternative. In a very sparsely populated country, Russian peasants also had an exit option; if they were not happy with their local lord, they could simply move
</p>

<p>
Finally, imperial Russian rulers lacked many of the autocracy-reinforcing technologies developed in other societies. So why did Russia not become an early democracy and then a modern one? Ultimately, Russia’s autocratic trajectory may have been determined by the fact that during the imperial period it had a weak state but an even weaker society. In this context rulers had relatively little to gain from building a system of representation of the sort that developed in western Europe. What they did instead was gradually extend bureaucratic control, even if this control was much weaker than that which existed in the Prussian case that
</p>

<p>
Muscovy did have some institutions that could have formed the basis for early democratic governance. Some have argued that this was part of an institutional panoply adopted from Mongol practices—including the kurultay—but this is much debated.64 We need to ask whether Russian councils bore any resemblance to the representative bodies that emerged and prospered throughout western Europe at this time.<br>
 The first of these councils was composed of nobles that advised the prince. In Muscovy and neighboring states nobles of the highest rank were referred to as Boyars, so the council would become known to later historians as the Boyar duma.
</p>

<p>
Beyond their limited prerogatives and ad hoc nature, the striking features of early Russian assemblies compared to those in western Europe was the absence of representatives of the towns.
</p>

<p>
This was a watershed moment in the development of political representation and an important step toward the construction of modern democracy. In Russia this simply did not happen. Some might argue that autocratic ideology accounts for the difference, but there is a more immediate explanation: Russia had few towns.70
</p>

<p>
In western Europe the commercial riches of medieval towns provided an important opportunity for princes. The towns could be a significant source of tax revenue, and they could collect this revenue themselves if their representatives were given seats in assemblies. In Russia the towns simply weren’t worth it, nor was there much of a tradition of guilds and other corporate bodies as existed in western Europe.
</p>

<p>
Though Russia had few towns, it did initially have a peasantry whose exit options could have helped pave the way for early democracy, at least at the local level. The problem was that around the turn of the seventeenth century the peasants lost this leverage. Given Russia’s northerly location, its peasantry were always particularly susceptible to climatic variation. Between 1601 and 1603 Russia experienced a climate-induced famine that was particularly severe. As a result of this and related events, the peasantry increasingly looked to nobles for protection, and they lost their exit option. By 1649 this was enshrined in a legal provision binding peasants to the land upon which they were currently located.

<p>
The World’s Largest Democracy<br>
 If some of America’s Founding Fathers—fearful of maintaining a republic in a vast country—had considered the case of India, they would have certainly despaired. India’s population of 330 million at independence was more than one hundred times the population of the United States in 1776. If you were Seymour Martin Lipset writing in 1959, you would have also drawn a negative conclusion—India was too poor to be a democracy.
</p>

<p>
A more complete explanation for India’s democratic success lies in the fact that unlike China, India had less of a legacy of a centralized bureaucratic state. At the same time, India also had a tradition of early democratic governance. I am not saying here that because Buddha’s clan in the sixth century BCE elected its leaders, India was destined to be a democracy today. But this tradition may still have mattered, and the economist and philosopher Amartya Sen has suggested precisely this.
</p>

<p>
Unlike China, India over the past two millennia has rarely been under control of a unified state. If we were to look for a legacy of a strong, bureaucratic state, then we would focus on the Mughal dynasty, which began in 1526. The empire was consolidated, and state institutions were constructed during the reign of Akbar from 1556 to 1605.
</p>

<p>
by 1595, Mughal emperors were able to extract about 5 percent of total production for their own purposes. This was a substantial amount if we compare it to the extraction ratios in Figure 1.1. It was also certainly a higher level of revenue extraction than in any European country at this time.
</p>

<p>
The village communities are little republics, having nearly everything that they can want within themselves, and almost independent of any foreign relations. They seem to last where nothing else lasts. Dynasty after dynasty tumbles down; revolution succeeds to revolution; Hindoo, Patan, Mogul, Mahratta, Sikh, English are all masters in turn; but the village community remains the same.
</p>

<p>
Thirty years later multiparty elections are the norm. In many cases these are flawed and fraudulent, but in something like a third of the continent’s countries we can speak of actual democracies, not only in terms of how outsiders judge them but also in terms of what Africans themselves suggest in surveys. This is a far cry from the Middle East, a region with a legacy of strong bureaucratic states where there has been essentially no transition to democracy. In what follows I will suggest that a legacy of state weakness may have helped pave the way for this change. But first I will describe the initial failure of democracy when African countries first gained independence from colonial control.<br>
 As we contemplate the history of democracy in Africa, we should also recall the
</p>

<p>
African autocracies did not emerge because of strong state institutions that controlled society.87 A number of states did develop systems for collecting revenue, but this was mostly dependent on the existence of an export crop, such as coffee or cocoa. Given the limited number of natural harbors in Africa, cash crops needed to be exported from a
</p>

<p>
physical control of these locations was sufficient to allow for a system of taxation. In a country like Côte d’Ivoire, instead of needing to develop a bureaucracy to assess and collect taxes in individual villages, all that was needed was to monitor and tax exports at two choke points, the ports of San Pedro and Abidjan.<br>
 Instead of strong state institutions, it was outside support that allowed African autocracies to survive. Recall from the discussion of early democracy in Arabia that stronger, more autocratic states were able to emerge as a result of support from outside powers who were vying for control. In this case the outside powers were the Roman and Sasanian empires. In Africa between 1960 and 1989 the outside powers were the United States, the Soviet Union, France, and, to a lesser extent, the United Kingdom.
</p>

<p>
It was once outside support for autocracy weakened that many African rulers would find themselves ill-equipped to resist democratization.
</p>

<br>

<p>
 A New Wave of
</p>

<p>
Let us return to Samuel Huntington’s prediction from 1991 and its judgment that African countries were probably too poor to sustain democracy. If this was correct, then if any African countries stood a chance of deviating from this trend, it would probably be those that are more developed than their peers. We might measure this by looking at those countries that have higher levels of income per capita, those with higher literacy rates, and perhaps also those that are more urbanized. It turns out that these indicators do a strikingly poor job of predicting democracy in Africa today.
</p>

<p>
There is an alternative explanation that does a better job of accounting for African democracy today, and it is one that fits with what I have argued throughout this book: African countries are more likely to be democracies today if they had weak states at the time that the Berlin Wall fell. State weakness may have made it more difficult for incumbent presidents to resist democratization.
</p>

<p>
So, it is possible that a legacy of state weakness created fertile ground for democratization in Africa. One of the interesting features of this is that if we look at the relationship between democracy and tax collection today in African countries, then we no longer see any correlation. This means that democratizing countries have been able to catch up to their peers in terms of tax collection. This could just be a process of mean reversion, or it could be a more deliberate story of state building. If so, this would also be another example of sequencing. Democracy can be better sustained if its establishment precedes the development of a strong state.
</p>

<br>

<p>
It is possible that this has led in some cases to an equilibrium where state weakness means that central rulers find it impossible to sustain autocracy while at the same time having little ability to provide services for their people.100<br>
 Finally, there is also another part
</p>

<p>
The comments by Taylor and Dunn, offered two centuries apart, point to the first fracture point of modern democracy: citizen participation is very broad, but it also risks being very thin. The question then is when citizens will think that this is something other than the sham that Taylor feared. The alternative may be one where democracy either dies or continues only in name as the 5,000—what today we would call the top 0.1 percent—dominate an unequal democracy of the sort that the political scientist Larry Bartels has written about.
</p>

<p>
In considering how to design a republic, many eighteenth- and nineteenth-century thinkers took the opposite view from Taylor. They worried that the 5,000,000 would expropriate the wealth of the 5,000. This was not just a fear held by the authors of the Federalist Papers. Throughout western Europe after 1789 political thinkers sought to create republican institutions that would limit the influence of the masses.5 The most obvious way to do this was to limit the suffrage, or to have systems of weighted voting, or to have upper chambers in legislatures to resist popular passions. But as we saw in chapter 11, these fears turned out to be overdone. Even after universal suffrage was established, there was no massive redistribution of wealth. Wealth inequality did eventually drop, but not as a result of democracy. It was instead wartime events, economic crisis, and also possibly underlying technological 
</p>

<p>
History suggests that even in a full democracy, the risk that the 5,000 will dominate is much greater than the threat that the 5,000,000 will expropriate the 5,000.<br>
 The second fracture point of modern democracy concerns executive power. It turns out that an elected leader at the helm of a modern democratic state can sometimes behave just as despotically as an autocrat. In early democracies from the Huron to the Dutch Republic this was simply not possible because power was so decentralized. This decentralization made the system stable, but the disadvantage was inflexibility. The Dutch found this out as the extreme decentralization of their institutions led to economic stagnation—local interests created barriers to entry into markets that stifled innovation.
</p>

<p>
In sum, as societies shifted from early to modern democracy two problems emerged. The first was the problem of keeping citizens connected with a distant state. The second was that of constraining executive power. We should consider each of these in turn.
</p>

<p>
the U.S. Constitution did not solve the problem of distrust of a distant state. There need to be continuing investments to see that citizens remain trustful of modern democracy.
</p>

<p>
In the essay that has come to be known as Federalist 10, James Madison made the case for a larger republic being more sustainable than a small one. In what Clinton Rossiter, writing in 1961, referred to as a “masterful analysis,” Madison focused on problems of “faction” or what we might think of today as excessive partisanship, polarization, and conflict. He posited that these problems would actually be greater in smaller republics. Therefore, concern about the great geographic scale of the proposed United States of America was unwarranted
</p>

<p>
It is fair to say that Rossiter’s interpretation of Federalist 10 has been the dominant one. It is also possible that it sounded better in 1961 than it does in 2020. In today’s world it is possible to argue that problems of polarization are fed precisely by the fact that the United States includes multiple regions where people have very different views. We also see better today that there can be a further cost to a large republic: citizen distrust and disengagement.<br>
 Federalist 10 appeared in New York newspapers on November 23, 1787. Madison’s argument came timed to respond to an essay written by an Anti-federalist who adopted the pseudonym of Brutus. Four weeks prior to Madison, on October 18, 1787, Brutus published an essay in the New York Journal that made the following criticism of the proposed republic.
</p>

<p>
The different parts of so extensive a country could not possibly be made acquainted with the conduct of their representatives, nor be informed of the reasons upon which measures were founded. The consequence will be, they will have no confidence in their legislature, suspect them of ambitious views, be jealous of every measure they adopt, and will not support the laws they pass.8
</p>

<p>
 While Madison focused on problems of faction, Brutus emphasized the link between individual citizens and their government. And the quote from his essay sounds much like it could describe the United States today where trust in the federal government has reached a low point.
</p>

<p>
The problem with the subsidiarity solution is that it can only go so far. Brian Barry, an influential political theorist, made this point when reviewing Robert Dahl and Edward Tufte’s work on size and democracy. Barry’s point was that confining governance to ever smaller units is of little use if the units become so small that they cannot control events around them.
</p>

<p>
The lesson from the Early Republic is that constitutional design on its own is not sufficient to ensure that citizens are informed and trust their government. In large, modern democracies there need to be continuous investments to see that democracy survives and that it does not only survive in name only as the “5,000” control things.
</p>

<p>
nor is there any evidence that new means of communication via the Internet have helped build trust.
</p>

<br>

<p>
Today the question is not one of having no information versus some—people can drown themselves in information (and disinformation) if they choose to do so. The key question is how the introduction of new technologies leads people to abandon older sources of information, perhaps changing the way they see government.
</p>

<p>
One of the clear trends in news access in recent years involves the disappearance of local news sources as new national sources emerge and as people substitute one source for another. The problem here is that local news sources report on both local and national developments, and people tend to trust local news media more than national news media. Local newspapers also help to foster democracy within communities. For various reasons, the structure of media markets may lead to the disappearance of local news sources that are deemed more trustworthy.
</p>

<p>
John McCormick, a political theorist, has advocated returning to certain features of governance present in city republics in Renaissance Italy that were supported by Niccolò Machiavelli. These include the use of assemblies that exclude elite members of society, appointment procedures that combine lottery with election, and finally possibilities for political trials conducted by citizens. One could also consider the reestablishment of independent mandates and instructions for representatives of the sort that I have considered in this book. One could add the practice of recalling elected officials to the list. In fact, as North American colonists in places like Connecticut and Rhode Island first implemented such practices in assemblies, they drew direct inspiration from Machiavelli’s writing.
</p>

<p>
still be quite far from the face-to-face democracy that eminent scholars such as Jayne Mansbridge have emphasized helps promote unity while fulfilling the participative needs that are intrinsic to humans.19
</p>

<br>
<br>

<p>
 Fear of a Strong State<br>
 The stability of early democracies was aided by the fact that they existed in the absence of central state coercion. The challenge of modern democracy is combining the core principle that the people should have power with the fact that day-to-day affairs of government are run by a strong bureaucratic state.
</p>

<p>
Recall from chapter 6 that it was the centralization of imperial power under the enlightened emperors of the Song dynasty that paved the way for more arbitrary rule under the Ming.
</p>

<br>

<p>
 The Importance of
</p>

<p>
Over the long sweep of history, in areas where strong bureaucratic states emerged first, democracy has subsequently been less likely to appear. Jacob Hariri, a political scientist, has referred to this phenomenon as the “autocratic legacy of early statehood.”22 Take the case of Egypt where one could say that the Egyptian bureaucracy is five thousand years old—this must certainly weigh against possibilities for establishing democracy. Recall that when ISIS established control of much of Iraq, they were able to pursue a deliberate strategy of co-opting the existing Iraqi bureaucracy. Those who inherit strong states also tend to inherit autocracy.<br>
 The greatest reason not to fear, despite indications, for the future of democracy in the United States and Western Europe also involves reference to sequencing.
</p>

<p>
With a view to European history, we have a habit of thinking that economic development strengthens society and prompts rulers to govern by consent. This is precisely what happened with the Commercial Revolution of the Middle Ages and the rise of cities. But during the Song dynasty, China experienced a commercial revolution of its own at roughly the same time without any shift to governance based on consent—this was an era where central state power was strengthened.
</p>

<p>
The parallels between China today and under the Song dynasty certainly are not perfect, but they are there. Rapid commercial growth has taken place, supported by significant state investment, and the state has recouped significant benefits. Centralized state control has also survived, and even been strengthened, as new technologies for communication arrived. During the Song dynasty woodblock printing expanded massively, and the state steered this in the direction it saw fit. So, technical manuals flowed freely but political texts were monitored
</p>

<p>
The other thing to recognize about the Chinese model of political development is that an absence of consent does not imply an absence of accountability. From 1059 BCE onward Chinese emperors publicly pronounced the importance of the Mandate of Heaven. This was a convenient way for a current dynasty to explain why the preceding dynasty deserved to lose power, but it also set a performance standard for the future. There was no mechanism established for enforcing this mandate, but the fact that Chinese emperors first thought of this idea
</p>

<p>
In the end, China is not a deviation from the European pattern of political development; it is simply a different path that has its own logic to it and may well stay that way.
</p>

<p>
If you are a supporter of democracy—as I am—then the message from this book may be that there is reason for hope. Humans have been ruling themselves in a collective fashion since the time they first established settled civilizations and before. Democracy is not something that only occurs at very specific moments, such as classical Athens, Renaissance Italy, and the United States of America.
</p>

<p>
Finally, we need to remember that just because modern democracy survives does not mean that we will be happy with how it performs if the 5,000 dominate over the 5,000,000. Instead of only asking whether democracy will survive, we need to also ask whether we will be satisfied with the democracy that does survive.
