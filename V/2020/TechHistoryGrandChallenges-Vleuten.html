<p>
van der Vleuten, Eric. (2020) History and Technology in an Age of "Grand Challenges": Raising Questions. <i>Technology and Culture</i> 61(1):260-271
</p>

<p>
- discusses if, why, and how the field of history of technology can and should engage with ongoing debates on "grand societal challenges"
</p>

<p>
262
</p>

<p>
"...the historical record is rife with social and environmental crises, and technology and technologists have long played their ambivalent roles as prominent cause and solution to such crises. Indeed, ever since the (civil) engineering profession's inception about two centuries ago, social challenges have co-produced new social and environmental problems that later generations of technologists again set out to solve." (van der Vleute, Erik, Engineering the Future)
</p>

<h2>Historians of tech. advocating for advocacy</h2>

<br>
<br>

<p>
"The transdisciplinary field of history of technology should be in a privileged position to develop historical interpretations and narratives of technology and grand societal challenges, for it has long studied the ambivalent interactions of technological, social, and environmental change."
</p>

<p>
- historians of technology advocating this direction: Bijker, Wiebe, Globalization and Vulnerability; Kaijser, Arne, The Trail from Trail; Joergensen, Finn Arne and Joergensen, Dolly, "The Anthropocene"; Schot, Johan, Confronting the Second Deep Transition; Tischler, Helmuth, The Anthropocene; Diogo, Maria Paula et al, Uncanny Nature
</p>

<h2>Real, imagined, contested features of crises</h2>

<br>
<br>

<p>
- scholars who have studied the real, imagined, and contested features of these crises, discussed whether or not these characterize our current age and, perhaps even an earth systemic state shift, the Anthropocene; and rethink research questions, perspectives, and concepts. <br>
Perrow, Charles. The Next Catastrophe

<h2>Tensions of Europe research network</h2>

<br>
<br>
<br>

<p>
- TENSIONS OF EUROPE research network: www.tensionsofeurope.eu
</p>

<p>
263
</p>

<p>
- investigating the historical interaction between crisis narratives and technological choices; "triple temporality of crisis" (in periods of widespread anxiety, cultural memories and experiences of *past* crises and fears of *future* calamities were often combined into novel contemporary crisis imaginaries mediating contemporary technology choices; illustrating this mechanism with examples from the realms of national security, nuclear energy, and space mining.) - Kalmbach, Karena; Åberg, Anna; Marklund, Andreas <a href="./CrisesAndTechFutures-Kalmbach.html" title="CrisesAndTechFutures-Kalmbach" class="page">CrisesAndTechFutures-Kalmbach</a>
</p>

<h2>Resource scarcity</h2>

<br>
<br>

<p>
- placing the present-day debates on resource security in historical perspective: raising historical questions about the cultural construction of such notions as "resources", "scarcity", and "resource crises"; highlight the spatial variety and connections of local, national, and global resource flows and associated global socioecological entanglements; and address the roles and limits of experts and expertise in the governance of resource crises and reconfiguration of natural environments. (Heymann, Michael; Kochetkova, Elena; Högselius, Per; Sparenberg, Ole; Martin, John; Åberg, Anna; Veraart, Frank) 
</p>

<h2>Energy challenges and transitions</h2>

<br>
<br>

<p>
- historicize current debates on "energy challenges" and "energy transition"; argue that historical research can uncover and unpack how past and present energy transitions are embedded within broader societal transitions, highlighting normative and perceptive changes as well as asymmetrical power relations. As important avenues for further research, they emphasize the long history of renewables in past social and environmental contexts: the historical roots, shaping, dynamics, and implications of today's incumbent fossil-fuel and nuclear-based energy systems; and the historical study of forces of change at work in past and present energy transitions. (Hasenöhrl, Ute; Meyer, Jan-Henrik) 
</p>

<h2>Sustainable mobility</h2>

<br>
<br>

<p>
- research network on the sustainable urban-mobility challenge (Schipper, Frank; Emanuel, Martin; Oldenziel, Ruth): enlist the notion of the "usable past" to identify historically shaped opportunities and barriers for mobility policies in cities across the globe. They confront expert discourses and social practices when historicizing today's dominant automobility-based urban-mobility systems, retrieving sidelined practices of low-emission mobilities such as pedestrianism and cycling, and identifying infrastructure and social-practice legacies on which sustainable mobility politics can be built. I  this context they speak of a "U-turn from the present via the past to the fture" in mobility history as well as policymaking. 
</p>

<p>
264
</p>

<p>
- governance of science and technology in an age of grand challenges (Arapostathis, Efstathios; Laborie, Leonard): observe a co-shaping of global challenges and the governance of science and technology; use the concept of "science diplomacy" to probe entanglements of technology, science, diplomacy, and diplomatic relations. They ask how democracy is at stake in such processes and make an argument for the historiography of science and technology to interact with political/civil society and scientific stakeholders in order to critically integrate historical stakeholder experiences into meaningful and relevant historical narratives.
</p>

<p>
- Paul Edwards: "Does it make any difference how the current state of affairs emerged?" (Hecht, Gabrielle; Edwards, Paul N., Taking on the Technosphere)
</p>

<p>
- the integrated study of humans, technology, and environmental crises leads us to institutional divides in the study of the past and to the Anthopocene literature's research challenge of bridging human time (history) and nonhuman time (geology, ecology), which requiers transcending singular and linear time frames. (Trischler, Helmuth; Will, Fabienne. Technosphere, Technocene; Chakrabarty, Anthropocene Time; Lorenz, Chris, Times They Are a-Changing)
</p>

<p>
265
</p>

<p>
- can we avoid reproducing once more the unreflective imposition of Western, technology-based time frmaes on the non-Western world that postcolonial historians have criticized so fiercely (Arnold, David: Europe, Technology and Colonialism; Bray, Francesca, Flows and Matrices) 
</p>

<h2>Warns against unacknowledged reproduction of conventional categories</h2>

<br>
<br>

<p>
- a warning against unacknowledged reproduction of conventional spatial categories as essentialist units of historical experience, as for example much nation-centric African history, comparative history, and transfer history once did<br>
- suggest symmetrical study of the (un)making of spatial connections and boundaries, including the continued relevance of classic historical formations such as the city, the nation, or world systems that persist despite multiple connections piercing their borders. (van der Vleuten, Transnational History of Technology; Turchetti, Simone et al, Have We Ever Been "Transnational"; Boom, Marte, Business Enterprise and Globalization; Werner, Michael and Zimmermann, Benedicte, Beyond Comparison; van der Vleuten, and Feys, Torsten, Borders and Frontiers)
</p>

<p>
266
</p>

<h2>Need to trace history of tech. across sector borders</h2>

<br>
<br>

<p>
- there is also a need to trace history of technology and crisis not only across temporal and spatial borders but through sector borders<br>
- most research programs tend to reproduce a single-sector focus; can we transcend sector-centrism next to chronocentrism and Eurocentrism?
</p>

<p>
- as for time and space, the trick seems to be addressing crisis and transition across, as well as within, sector boundaries<br>
- "Empirical studies of incident reports across critical infrastructure sectors found that crises regularly cascaded across sector boundaries, but also that most crises were contained within a few cascade pathways or particular sectors and died out before cascading into catastrophic societal collapse." (van Eeten, Michel et al, The State and the Threat)
</p>

<p>
- what counts as good knowledge and good knowledge production remains central to much academic identity and boundary work. 
</p>

<p>
267
</p>

<h2>Mixed methods research</h2>

<br>
<br>

<p>
- Methodological divides between the "two cultures" of the humanities and the sciences seem especially difficult to bridge. 
</p>

<p>
- discussions on mixed qualitative and quantitative methods have long been a rarity in the field of history of technology
</p>

<p>
- but for mixed-methods approaches for the study of technology and grand challenges, see Lintsen, Harry et al, Well-Being, Sustainability and Social Development; Veraart, Frank et al., Connected by Oil 
</p>

<p>
Fickers, Andreas. Towards a New Digital Historicism?; 
</p>

<p>
- crisis-of-all-crises concept of the Anthropocene; historians as prominent traders in a trading zone for cross-disciplinary encounters between the humanities and the sciences: Trischler, Anthropocene, 328-29
</p>

<p>
- but HOW to engage? some historians cherish the divide between professional history and politics, remembering the many abuses of history for political purposes in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, they insist on studying the dynamics of technology and crises without preference for political priorities, public hype, or commercial interests (which, obviously, IS a political choice in itself)
</p>

<h2>Historians seeking to intervene in political debate</h2>

<br>
<br>

<p>
- others explicitly seek to *intervene* in ongoing political, public, and business debates and *interact* with relevant" stakeholders; concepts such as "policy-oriented history,", "the usable past", knowledge "co-creation", etc:<br>
Divall, Colin. Mobilizing the History of Technology; Hirsh, Richard. Historians of Technology; Hirsh, Richard and Jones, Christopher, History's contributions to Energy Research; Lundin, Per. Making History Matter; Colin Divall et al, Transport Policy
</p>

<p>
- how should historians balance professional integrity and relevance?
