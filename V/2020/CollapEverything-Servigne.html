“Probably the greatest agreement among scholars, though, is that the failing civilizations suffered from growing hubris and overconfidence: the belief that their capabilities after many earlier tests would always rise to the occasion and that growing signs of weakness could be ignored as pessimistic.

“Systems often hold longer than we think, but they end up by collapsing much faster than we imagine.

<p>
Ken Rogoff (former Chief Economist of the International Monetary Fund), 2012”
</p>

<p>
“Isn’t taking the darkest possible view of the future a typically European or western piece of narcissism? Isn’t catastrophism a new opium of the people, distilled by ecological ayatollahs and scientists in need of funding? Come on, everybody, give it a bit of welly – we’ll soon have put paid to the ‘crisis’!”
</p>

<br>
<br>

<p>
“A collapse is ‘the process at the end of which basic needs (water, food, housing, clothing, energy, etc.) can no longer be provided [at a reasonable cost] to a majority of the population by services under legal supervision’.1”
</p>

<br>

<p>
“Yves Cochet, ‘L’effondrement, catabolique ou catastrophique?’, Institut Momentum, 27 May 2011”
</p>

<br>

<p>
“Scientific publications that envisage global catastrophes and an increasing probability of collapse are becoming more numerous and better supported by the evidence. The Royal Society published an article by Paul and Anne Ehrlich on this subject in 2013, leaving little doubt about the outcome”
</p>

<p>
“Paul R. Ehrlich and Anne H. Ehrlich, ‘Can a collapse of global civilization be avoided?’, Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B 280(1754), 2013: 20122845.”
</p>

<br>

<p>
“And yet, in media and intellectual circles, the question of collapse is not taken seriously. The notorious computer bug that threatened to strike in 2000, and the ‘Mayan event’ of 21 December 2012, put paid to the possibility of any serious and factual argument. Anyone who publicly mentions a ‘collapse’ is seen as announcing the Apocalypse, and relegated to the narrow category of those ‘credulous believers’ in the ‘irrational’ who have ‘always existed’. End of story. Time to change the subject!”
</p>

<br>

<p>
“The birth of ‘collapsology’<br>
Despite the high quality of some of the philosophical reflections on this topic,5 the debate on collapse (or ‘the end of a world’) fails because of the absence of factual arguments. It is stuck in imaginary or philosophical speculation without any real factual grounding. The books dealing with collapse are usually too specialized, restricted by their point of view or discipline (archaeology, economics, ecology, etc.), while more systematic discussions are full of gaps.”
</p>

<br>

<p>
“For example, Jean-Pierre Dupuy, Pour un catastrophisme eéclairé: quand l’impossible est certain (Paris: Seuil, 2002); Hicham-Stéphane Hafeissa, La Fin du monde et de l’humanité. Essai de généalogie du discours écologique (Paris: PUF, 2014); Patrick Viveret, Du bon usage de la fin d’un monde (Paris: Les Liens qui Libèrent, 2012); Michaël Foessel, Après la fin du monde. Critique de la raison apocalyptique (Paris: Seuil, 2012).”
</p>

<br>

<p>
“Jared Diamond’s bestseller Collapse, for example, sticks to the archaeology, ecology and biogeography of ancient civilizations and does not address some of the essential questions of the current situation.6”
</p>

<br>

<p>
“Not only do we lack any real inventory – or better, any systematic analysis – of the planet’s economic and biophysical situation, but above all we lack an overview of what a collapse might look like, how it might be triggered and what it would imply in psychological, sociological and political terms for the present generations. We lack any real applied, transdisciplinary science of collapse.”
</p>

<br>

<p>
“We here propose, by drawing on information from many scattered works published across the world, to create the basics of what, with a certain self-deprecating irony, we have called ‘collapsology’ (from the Latin collapsus, ‘a fallen mass’). The goal is not to indulge in the mere scientific pleasure of accumulating knowledge but rather to shed light on what is happening and might happen to us, in other words, to give meaning to events.”
</p>

<br>

<p>
“Immersing ourselves in the word ‘collapse’, understanding its subtleties and nuances, distinguishing between fact and fantasy – these are some of the objectives of collapsology. We need to take this notion apart and conjugate it in different tenses to give it texture, detail, and nuance: we need, in short, to make of it a living and fully operational concept. Whether we are thinking of Mayan civilization, the Roman Empire or more recently the USSR, history shows us that there are varying degrees of collapse, and that, even if there are constants, each case is unique.”
</p>

<p>
.<br>
“It’s a book that attempts lucidly to set out the facts, to ask relevant questions, and to assemble a toolbox which will make it possible to grasp the subject other than through Hollywood disaster movies, the Mayan calendar or ‘techno-bliss”

“As early as 1907, the philosopher Henri Bergson, with extraordinary prophetic insight, wrote:
</p>

<p>
A century has elapsed since the invention of the steam-engine, and we are only just beginning to feel the depths of the shock it gave us. But the revolution it has effected in industry has nevertheless upset human relations altogether. New ideas are arising, new feelings are on the way to flower. In thousands of years, when, seen from the distance, only the broad lines of the present age will still be visible, our wars and our revolutions will count for little, even supposing they are remembered at all; but the steam-engine, and the procession of inventions of every kind that accompanied it, will perhaps be spoken of as we speak of the bronze or of the chipped stone of prehistoric times: it will serve to define an age”

</p>

<br>

<p>
“The <b>age of heat engines and the technosciences replaced the age of agrarian and artisanal societies</b>. The appearance of fast and cheap transportation opened up new routes for commerce, and shrank distances. In the industrialized world, the hellish rhythms of automatized production lines became widespread and, gradually, overall material comfort levels increased. Decisive progress in public hygiene, food and medicine increased lifespan and reduced mortality rates considerably. World population, which had doubled about every thousand years over the last eight millennia, doubled in just one century. From one billion people in 1830, it grew to two billion in 1930. Then things really speeded up”
</p>

<br>

<p>
“During the twentieth century, energy consumption increased tenfold, the extraction of industrial minerals by a factor of 27, and that of building materials by a factor of 34”
</p>

</p>

<br>

<p>
“This huge acceleration can also be seen on the social level. The German philosopher and sociologist Hartmut Rosa describes three dimensions of this social acceleration.10 The first is technical acceleration: ‘the increase in travelling and communication speeds, indeed, lies behind that highly characteristic experience of our times, the “shrinking of space”: distances in space appear to be shrinking as we can cross them more quickly and easily”
</p>

<br>

<p>
“Hartmut Rosa, Social Acceleration: A New Theory of Modernity, trans. Jonathan Trejo-Mathys (New York: Columbia University Press, 2013).”
</p>

<br>

<p>
“Hartmut Rosa, ‘Accélération et dépression. Réflexions sur le rapport au temps de notre époque’, Rhizome 43, 2012: 4–13.”
</p>

<br>

<p>
“The second is the acceleration in social change: our habits and our patterns of relationship are becoming transformed ever more quickly. For example, it is clear ‘that our neighbours move in and then move out ever more frequently, that our life partners (or partners for parts of our lives), as well as our jobs, have ever shorter “half-lives”, and that fashions, car models and musical styles succeed one another with increasing rapidity.’ We are witnessing a veritable ‘shrinking of the present’.”
</p>

<br>

<p>
“The third acceleration is the acceleration in the rhythms of our lives: in reaction to technical and social acceleration, we try to live faster. We fill our timetables ever more efficiently; we strive to avoid ‘wasting’ this precious time and, strangely, the number of things we need (and want) to do seems to grow indefinitely. ‘The acute “shortage of time” has become a permanent state of modern societies.”
</p>

<br>

<p>
“The result? Happiness eludes us, we suffer burn-out, depression becomes endemic. And the height of progress is that this social acceleration that we relentlessly manufacture/suffer no longer aims to improve our standard of living, it just serves to maintain the status quo.”
</p>

<br>

<p>
“It may be simple or even simplistic, but the metaphor of the car has the advantage of clearly distinguishing between the different ‘problems’ (call them ‘crises’) that we face. It suggests that there are two types of limit, or more precisely that there are limits on the one hand and boundaries on the other. The former cannot be crossed because they come up against the laws of thermodynamics: that’s the problem of the fuel tank. The second can be crossed but they are no less insidious because they are invisible, and we realize that we are crossing them only when it is too late. This is the problem of speed and keeping the vehicle on course.”
</p>

<br>

<p>
“The limits of our civilization are imposed by the quantities of so-called ‘stock’ resources, which are by definition nonrenewable (fossil fuels and ores), and ‘flow’ resources (water, wood, food, etc.): these are renewable but we are exhausting them far too quickly for them to have time to regenerate. However much the engine may gain in efficiency, there will always come a time when it can no longer work for lack of fuel”
</p>

<br>

<p>
“The boundaries of our civilization represent thresholds that cannot be crossed on pain of destabilizing and destroying the systems that keep it alive: for example, the climate, the major cycles of the Earth system, and ecosystems (which include all non-human living things). If the vehicle goes too fast, we can no longer perceive the details of the road, and this increases the risk of an accident (see chapter 3). We”
</p>

<br>

<p>
“These crises are of profoundly different natures, but they all have the same common denominator: the car’s acceleration. In addition, each of the limits and boundaries is all by itself capable of seriously destabilizing civilization. The problem, in our case, is that we are running up against several limits simultaneously and we have already crossed several boundaries!”
</p>

<br>

<p>
“The car is our society, our thermo-industrial civilization. We’ve climbed aboard and set off, our satnavs set for a sunny destination. No stop-offs are planned. Sitting comfortably in the passenger seat, we forget about speed, we ignore the living creatures we run over, the tremendous energy being expended and the amount of exhaust we are leaving behind us.”

<p>
“A peak is the moment when the extraction rate of a resource reaches an upper limit before declining inexorably. This is more than a theory, it’s a kind of geological principle: to begin with, extractable resources are easy to access; production explodes, then stagnates and finally declines when the only raw material left is not easy to access, thus describing a bell curve (see Figure 2.1). The top of the curve, the peak moment, does not mean the resource has been depleted but rather signals the beginning of its decline.”

“In fact, drilling companies in this domain mostly produce dreadful financial results. According to a report from the American energy department, the combined assets of 127 companies that drill for shale oil and gas in the United States show a deficit of 106 billion dollars for the fiscal year 2013—14,20 a deficit which they have hastened to fill by opening up new credit lines. But to attract more investment and show financial analysts a positive result, they have had to sell 73 billion dollars’ worth of assets. The result has been exploding debts and an increasing lack of capacity to generate the revenue necessary to repay them.21”

“In an attempt to artificially inflate the growth and competitiveness of the United States, the Federal Reserve Bank allowed oil companies to borrow at extremely low interest rates, thereby manufacturing a time bomb: the slightest rise in interest rates would push the most fragile companies to the edge of bankruptcy.

“very optimistic estimates – from the International Energy Agency indicate that the oil sands of Canada and Venezuela will each provide five million barrels per day in 2030, which represents less than 6 per cent of total fuel production by this date (projected).27 So, even in the best-case scenario, it is impossible to compensate for the decline of conventional fuels in this way.”

“The principle of energy use is roughly the following: we first allocate all the energy surplus we have to the tasks essential for our survival, such as food production, building and heating our habitats, making our clothes, and running health systems in the cities. Then we split the remaining balance between the systems of justice, national security, defence, social security, health and education. Finally, if we have any energy surplus left, we use it for our entertainment (tourism, cinema, etc.).”

“Two research teams on different methods have recently modelled the complex relationship between EROI and production costs (price per barrel).56 Their conclusions are the same: when the EROI of fossil fuel dips below 10:1, prices rise in a non-linear way, in other words, exponentially”

“Knowing that about two-thirds of the growth in the years 1945–75 was due to the burning of fossil fuels – the remainder being the product of labour and investment58 – we can deduce that the inexorable decline of the EROI for fossil fuel will result in a huge shortfall that will make it impossible to keep the promise of economic growth”

“The problem we are encountering now is that once resource costs get too high, the debt-based system no longer works. A new debt-based financial system likely won’t work any better than the old one’.61 A debt system has a bulimic need for growth and thus energy. But the opposite is also true: our energy system ‘shoots up’ on debts. Thus the belt drive works both ways: a decline in oil production pushes our economies towards recession; conversely, economic recessions accelerate the decline in energy production.62”

[…] But if these huge changes do occur it seems likely that few of the teeming billions now alive will survive”

“the circulation of ocean currents could change, as it has done in the past, creating a risk of anoxia (lack of oxygen) in the depths of the ocean. If the anoxic layer reaches the surface of the oceans, where the light enters, we would then witness the proliferation of bacteria producing hydrogen sulphide, a gas known to destroy the ozone layer and make the atmosphere unbreathable. These ‘Canfield Oceans’, which have occurred on Earth in the past, would annihilate most marine and terrestrial life. Although this is only a hypothesis for the moment, it is still taken very seriously by some scientists. According to Dennis Bushnell, director of research at NASA, it is even conceivable that this might happen before 2100.”

“Very recently, a series of disturbing studies has darkened the picture even more, highlighting the extinction of ecological interactions. When a species dies, it never dies alone: it usually takes some of its neighbours with it without anyone noticing. Extinctions are like shocks that spread across the food web, affecting predators and prey of the ‘endangered’ species (vertically) and impacting indirectly on other species indirectly related to the latter (horizontally).37 For example, the extermination of sea otters causes a proliferation of sea urchins (their prey), which transforms the seabed into deserts, which in turn impacts on other food chains and other predators.”

</p>

<br>

<p>
“Allowing a species to die out deprives others of valuable and even vital resources. We are discovering, for example, that the collapse of the populations of some pollinators can cause the widespread collapse of all the pollinators of an ecosystem and thus have a serious impact on the plants that depend on it, i.e., the agricultural yields.38”
</p>

<br>

<p>
“The shock wave can also strike us with unexpected speed. A study published in 2013 showed that the disappearance of ecological interactions (‘functional extinctions’) precedes the extinctions of populations. In other words, a species (the otter, for example) is already losing ‘connections’ with its neighbours as soon as decline sets in, entailing the disappearance (in 80 per cent of cases) of other species around it well before it has died out itself. These indirect and silent extinctions can begin very early, even before the population of the endangered species has lost a third of its total population (whereas it is not officially declared an endangered species until its decline has reached a figure of 30 per cent).”
</p>

<br>

<p>
“After this point – paradoxically – the most endangered species are not the ones we imagine but those that are indirectly related to those we think are most endangered. Even ecologists, long aware of these effects, have been surprised by the extent of such ‘domino effects’. What are now known as co-extinctions are potentially the most numerous,40 but they are unpredictable, and we do not observe them until it’s too late. That is one possible explanation for the catastrophic extent of the destruction of biodiversity through human activity.”

“When it comes to tropical forests, due to poaching and excessive hunting, they are ‘empty of wildlife’, observes Richard Corlett of Xishuangbanna Tropical Botanical Garden in Menglun (China). This is a reality that we can observe in most of the lush tropical forests of the world, in Asia, Africa and Latin America. In Borneo, after thirty years of measurements in the forest of Lambir, the ecologist Rhett Harrison and his team from the World Agroforestry Centre in Kunming (China) have been able to closely observe this ‘defaunation’: the animals are no longer there, there is nothing left. ‘There is deafening silence,’ notes Carlos Peres of the University of East Anglia.57”

For ecosystems, it’s (almost) the same. For a long time, it was believed that nature responded to disruptions in a gradual and proportionate manner. In reality, ecosystems also function as switches. Those which undergo regular disruptions (hunting, fishing, pollution, droughts, etc.) do not immediately show any apparent signs of wear, but gradually – and imperceptibly – lose their capacity to recover (i.e., they lose their so-called ‘resilience’) until reaching a tipping point, an invisible threshold beyond which the ecosystem collapses in a brutal and unpredictable way.

The gradual decrease in the number of large fish causes, at a particular moment, a domino effect throughout the food web which in the end leads to a very sudden and widespread proliferation of microalgae. This new state is very stable and difficult to reverse. The problem is that nobody had anticipated this invasion of algae, and no one could (until recently) predict it.”

”we find ourselves in an absurd situation where the old typewriters have disappeared but where everyone still uses the old technical system that came with them, though it is less efficient for our own times.<br>
In a completely different field, it has now been clearly demonstrated that alternative farming systems, such as agroecology, permaculture and bio-intensive micro-agriculture,2 can produce – with much less energy – yields per hectare comparable with or even superior to industrial agriculture over smaller surfaces, while restoring soils and ecosystems by reducing the impact on the climate and by restructuring peasant communities.3 The Grupo de Agricultura Orgánica (GAO) of Cuba received the alternative Nobel Prize (Right Livelihood Award) in 1999 for demonstrating this in a concrete, large-scale way.4”

<p>
”The answer lies in the very structure of our system of innovation. In fact, when a new and more efficient technology makes its appearance, it does not automatically become the norm – far from it. Indeed, it is often very difficult to change systems because of a phenomenon that historians and sociologists of innovation call sociotechnical ‘lock-in’.”
</p>

<br>

<p>
”How a system becomes locked in<br>
Let’s take two other examples, the electric system and car transport.7 In the first case, when one or several thermal electric power plants are installed in a region, this triggers a self-reinforcing cycle. The government, through economic incentives or favourable legislation, perpetuates the system of electricity production by allowing investors to develop it and therefore predict the generation of later and more efficient power plants. Gradually, the growth of this technical system generates economies of scale and lower costs which, in turn, increase the availability of the system for a greater number of users. In so doing, the electric system becomes part of consumers’ habits, and the price of electricity, which has become affordable, promotes not only its expansion but also fosters a growing consumption of energy.”
</p>

<br>

<p>
”Then this sociotechnical system becomes widespread and gives rise to a multitude of secondary innovations that improve it and consolidate it. Finally, as demand grows, the government take measures favourable to its expansion and so on, thus increasing the dominance of the electric system. Lock-in appears when new technical niches, for example alternative and more efficient energy systems, can no longer emerge because the dominant energy system leaves no space for diversity.”
</p>

<br>

<p>
”For car transport, a similar cycle has been established. By promoting ever-denser road infrastructures, governments are increasing the use already made of them by drivers (because they can always go farther and faster), and allow new users to benefit from these infrastructures. The increasing use of the road system promotes investment and public support. Tax revenue grows steadily, allowing the system to expand and even to destroy other more efficient transport systems, as in the United States with the destruction of the tram system in the early twentieth century by General Motors, Standard Oil and Firestone, with the help of the government.8”
</p>

<br>

<p>
”The self-referential side of this process is fundamental. The more this dominant system becomes entrenched, the more it has the means to maintain its dominance. It swallows up all the available resources and ‘mechanically’ prevents the emergence of alternatives, whereas it is precisely in its early stages that an innovation needs support and investment. <b>In other words, the ‘small shoots’ are not able to compete with the big tree that provides them with shade.</b> The tragedy is that, by preventing small systems on the margins from blossoming, we deprive ourselves of potential solutions for the future.”
</p>

<br>

<p>
”<b>Lock-in mechanisms are numerous and very various</b>. First, there are the purely technical aspects. For example, a dominant system can decide on the compatibility (or not) of objects introduced to the market by small emerging competitors, as is often the case in the field of computing.<br>
There are also psychological aspects. For example, a research team from the University of Indiana has shown that <b>investments in innovative technology design depended more on the trajectories of the past than on desires for the future</b>.9 Investors are not as reckless as we might think: they tend to prefer investing in what already works and what engineers can improve, rather than in an unknown system that has not yet won its spurs. This could explain, incidentally, why we find it so difficult to try out new and truly innovative political systems”

<p>
”9. M. A. Janssen and M. Scheffer, ‘Overexploitation of renewable resources by ancient societies and the role of sunk-cost effects’, Ecology and Society 9(1), 2004: 6”
</p>

<br>

<p>
”In the same spirit, <b>one very important psychological obstacle is related to the inertia of individual behaviour and the reluctance of individuals to change</b>. <b>When a system is implanted, it creates habits that we have trouble getting rid of:</b> plastic bags in supermarkets, the 70 mph maximum speed limit on motorways, and so on.”
</p>

<br>

<p>
”There are also institutional mechanisms, such as legal and regulatory frameworks, that prevent the emergence of new ‘sociotechnical niches’: these include the regulation of agricultural pesticides, blocking the development of natural products, and the seed laws that stifle innovative seed techniques in peasant communities. Then there is the difficulty governments have in abandoning major grant programmes. At the global level, for example, the total grants awarded to fossil fuels came to US$550 billion in 2013 (against US$120 billion for renewable energies).10 The institutional inertia of a system is also reflected in the construction of large ecologically destructive and economically useless projects, where huge investments are committed on the basis of decisions dating back to a time when conditions (economic, social and environmental) were not the same as today. Finally, another institutional lock-in mechanism is simply the existence of very heavy infrastructures related to a source of energy.”
</p>

<br>

<p>
”But, some will retort, isn’t the raison d’être of an institution precisely to preserve an accumulated heritage, a sociotechnical trajectory, a certain social order? Certainly: but the problem is that it is precisely the institutions dedicated to innovation (public and private research) which are monopolized by the dominant sociotechnical system. In the agronomic sciences, for example, a PhD student in agroecology will find his or her path strewn with far more obstacles and yielding far fewer credits than a PhD student in agrochemistry or genetic engineering12 – let alone the fact that it will be much harder to publish in ‘prestigious’ scientific journals”
</p>

<br>

<p>
”This leads Jean Gadrey, former professor of economics at the University of Lille, to protest: ‘Try entrusting [the agriculture of the future] to an academy of “best experts” at the INRA [the French National Institute for Agricultural Research] where, out of nine thousand positions, there are only thirty-five jobs in full-time equivalent posts in research on organic farming!’13”

Vanloqueren and P. V. Baret, ‘Why are ecological, low-input, multi-resistant wheat cultivars slow to develop commercially? A Belgian agricultural “lock-in” case study’, Ecological Economics 66(2), 2008: 436–46”
</p>

<br>

<p>
”Lock-in mechanisms can also be identified in the principles of collective action. For example, citizens involved in the fight against global heating and in building a ‘post-carbon’ world can be counted in the tens of millions (we can see this in consciousness-raising campaigns, demonstrations, petitions and debates), but they are scattered and uncoordinated (not to mention the fact that, like everyone, they use fossil fuels to live). Conversely, far fewer people are engaged in producing energy from fossil fuels. The Total group, for example, has a hundred thousand employees (some of whom are probably convinced that we must fight against global heating) who are much better organized and can draw on considerable funds (a gross figure of 22.4 billion euros’ worth of investment in 2013). In short, an established technical system provides itself with the means to resist change.”
</p>

<br>

<p>
”Let’s not be naive. The lock-in is not just ‘mechanical’, it is also the result of intense lobbying campaigns.”
</p>

<br>

<p>
”These campaigns can even transgress the legal framework. In 1968, General Electric practised aggressive marketing to impose this same type of heating on real-estate developers, ‘even threatening the promoters that they would not connect their housing lots if they supplied any other sources of energy’.14 The development of solar energy in the United States in those years was therefore stifled even though it constituted a better technical solution. In the same way, to push the peasant world into the system of pesticides (the so-called ‘green revolution’), agro-chemical firms had to deploy considerable energy and spend insane amounts of money,15”
</p>

<br>

<p>
”Indeed, over time, societies gradually turn towards natural resources that become increasingly expensive as they are more difficult to exploit (the easiest being exhausted first), thereby reducing their energy benefits at the very same time as they are increasing their bureaucracy, social control spending at home and military budgets simply in order to maintain the status quo. Locked in by all this complexity, the metabolism of a society reaches a threshold of diminishing returns that makes it more and more vulnerable to collapse”
</p>

<br>

<p>
”By becoming globalized, our industrial society has reached extreme levels of complexity; indeed, as we saw earlier, it is entering a phase of diminishing returns. But above all, it has dangerously extended its sociotechnical lock-ins. Indeed, once a system is established in a region or a country, it becomes economically very competitive or even technically efficient and spreads rapidly to other countries through knock-on effects. The effectiveness of the systems in place then makes it difficult to break out of this paradigm, especially when competition between all countries becomes the rule. This ‘global lock-in’19 can be illustrated by three examples: the financial system; the energy system based on carbon; and growth.”

”<b>Locking in growth follows the same logic.

Not only do these systems prevent any transition, they cannot even afford to let themselves be tampered with in case they collapse. Since the system is self-referential, it is obvious that we will not be able to find solutions within the dominant system. We must cultivate innovations on the margins. That’s the whole purpose of a transition. But are there any margins left?”

”To sum up, we have very quickly climbed the ladder of technical progress and complexity in what could be considered a self-perpetuating headlong flight. Today, while the height of the ladder of progress may make us feel giddy, many people are realizing – with horror – that its bottom rungs have disappeared and that the ascent is continuing inexorably nonetheless. It’s no longer possible to stop this upwards movement and come down quietly to find a less complex lifestyle on terra firma – unless we jump off the ladder, which will involve a shock for the person jumping or indeed trigger a major systemic shock if lots of people fall off the ladder at the same time.26 Those who understand this are filled with anxiety that the further their ascent continues, the more painful will be their fall.”

”For physicist Yaneer Bar-Yam, research scientist at the MIT Media Laboratory and director of the New England Complex Systems Institute in Cambridge, Massachusetts, ‘A networked society behaves like a multicellular organism’.2 Most of the organs are vital; you can’t amputate a single part without risking the death of the whole organism. What Bar-Yam discovered was that <b>the more complex these systems are, the more vital each organ becomes for the whole organism.</b> At the global level, therefore, all the sectors and all the regions of our globalized civilization have become interdependent to the point where one of them cannot suffer from a collapse without making the whole metaorganism vulnerable. In other words, our living conditions at this precise time and in this precise place depend on what happened a short time ago in many places on Earth. This suggests that, as Bar-Yam points out, ‘[industrial] civilization is very vulnerable’.3”

”There are three main categories of risk that threaten the stability of a complex system: threshold effects (‘all or nothing’ phenomena), domino effects (or contagion effects), and the inability of the system to recover its balance after a shock (the phenomenon of hysteresis).4 As we have seen, these risks are present in the natural systems on which we depend but they also exist in our own systems, as we will see for finance, supply chains and the physical infrastructures that shape our societies.”

”the international financial system has become a complex network of debts and obligations that connects the balance sheets of a large number of intermediaries.5 We can measure this complexification by the growing body of regulations that have had to be set up to manage it. For example, the Basel Accords, which aim to guarantee a minimum level of equity in order to ensure the financial soundness of the banks, contained 30 pages in 1988 (Basel I), 347 in 2004 (Basel II), and 616 in 2010 (Basel III). The documents necessary to implement these agreements between signatory countries, for example, the United States, ran to 18 pages in 1998 and now contain about 30,000 pages!6”

<p>
”The system has also gained in speed and sophistication. Thanks to high frequency trading, buying and selling orders can be effected automatically at speeds of the order of a millionth of a second using ever more powerful computers.7 Operators have also innovated by developing new financial products, derivatives (the credit default swap, or CDS, and collateralized debt obligation, or CDO), the volume of which has soared. According to the statistics of the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), the derivatives market rose to 710,000 billion in December 2013,8 approximately ten times the size of world GDP”
</p>

<br>

<p>
”The problem is that the concentration of actors, the complexity and speed of the financial system and the growing gap between regulation and traders’ ‘innovations’ have made the financial system very fragile.9 Shocks can now spread very rapidly to the whole network.10 But also, complexity can itself trigger a crisis: when the economic conditions deteriorate (due to the bankruptcy of customers or a reduction in the market value of the assets they hold), banks find it so difficult to evaluate all their connections with other banks that a general mistrust sets in and provokes a fire sale, which ends with a freeze on transactions.11 This is what happened in 2008.<br>
Worse still, to avoid an economic collapse after this last crisis, governments have taken so-called ‘unconventional’ measures. Panic-stricken by the extent of the crisis, the central banks proceeded to quantitative easing, the modern equivalent of printing banknotes”

”Supply chains on the razor’s edge<br>
Over the last decades, the real economy has also become tightly interconnected through the establishment of a huge network of supply chains that facilitates the continuous flow of goods and services, from producers to consumers. Today, companies operate ‘internationally’: to maximize profits, they relocate and subcontract everything they can. Their new management practices focus on efficiency (the hunt for ‘hidden costs’) and favour just-in-time supplies to avoid keeping stocks when they become too expensive. The last vital stocks of oil and food still owned by states are only enough to hold out for a few days or even a few weeks. In the case of oil, for example, France has the obligation to stock at least 90 days’ worth of net imports.16”
</p>

<br>

<p>
”By increasing the length and connectivity of these supply chains, and reducing stocks to nil, the global economic system has gained in efficiency what it has lost in resilience. As for finance, the least disruption can now cause considerable damage and spread like wildfire through the whole economy. The example of the 2011 floods in Thailand speaks volumes. Following heavy rains and four intense tropical storms, many Thai companies, from agriculture to computer and microchip manufacture, were affected by the floods. In this great rice-producing country, the annual output collapsed by 20 per cent; the worldwide production of hard drives dropped by 28 per cent, which made prices soar; the production of computers and digital photo and video recorders stopped. Rising water also devastated the Honda, Nissan and Toyota factories, which all had to stop production. In 2012, the World Economic Forum pointed out that this was all due to the fact that ‘the expansion in global supply chains has greatly increased the possibility of production disruption from such disasters’.17”

”Some researchers have described how globalized supply chains contributed to the collapse of world trade in the 2008 crisis.21 Others have developed macroeconomic models to try and understand these knock-on mechanisms.22 They are discovering that, like the global financial situation, knock-on effects in the supply networks can now be compared to the domino effects of trophic chains (which we discussed in chapter 2 on biodiversity).23 A shock such as the insolvency of a supplier spreads vertically and then horizontally as it destabilizes competitors. To crown it all, supply chains are all the more fragile as they depend on the good health of the financial system that provides the credit lines necessary to any economic activity.”

The next day, people rushed into supermarkets and grocery stores to stock up on food. A day later, 90 per cent of service stations were out of fuel and the National Health Service began to cancel non-essential surgical operations. Royal Mail postal deliveries stopped and schools in many towns and villages closed their doors.

”What will be the spark?<br>
So far, we have seen that these systemic risks took the shape of limited losses and temporary blockages at very localized spots and specific times. The question now is whether a disruption in the financial system, supply chains or infrastructures can spread to the entire global economy and bring about its collapse.<br>
According to David Korowicz, a systemic risk specialist, the answer is yes, and the spark could come from two places.34 The first is the oil peak, which would jeopardize our monetary system of fractional reserves (based on debt), as we saw in chapter 2. The second is an overall imbalance in the financial system. In both cases, the global economic collapse would first involve a phase of generalized loss of confidence, itself caused by the insolvency of states and banks.<br>
To support this, Korowicz describes a scenario of knock-on effects, starting with the disordered bankruptcy of a state in the euro area. This ‘crisis’ would sow panic in the banking sector country by country and then affect whole economies, in other words all sectors of activity, eventually mutating into food shortages after a few days.

”In another vein, a severe pandemic could also be the cause of a major collapse.35 For this, there is no need for a virus that would wipe out 99 per cent of humankind: just a small percentage would suffice. Indeed, when a society becomes more complex, the specialization of tasks intensifies, producing key functions without which society cannot manage. Examples include road hauliers who supply the country with fuel; certain technical jobs in nuclear power plants; and engineers who maintain computer hubs. For Bar-Yam, ‘One of the most profound results of complex systems research is that when systems are highly complex, individuals matter.’36”

”According to Jon Lay, who heads a global emergency team at Exxon Mobil which simulated the effects of a return of the 1918 flu pandemic, ‘We think that if we can make people feel safe about coming to work, we’ll have about 25 per cent staff absences if we get a flu pandemic like the one in 1918.’37 In this case, if everything is done to preserve important jobs, there will be no serious consequences. ‘If we have 50 per cent absences, it’s a different story.’ And if we include not just the sick but those who stay at home because they are afraid of the pandemic, the domino effects could be catastrophic. After a few days, the whole system might implode. In 2006, economists simulated the effects of the 1918 flu pandemic on today’s world. The result: 142 million deaths worldwide, and an economic recession that would lop 12.6 per cent off global GDP.38 In this scenario, the mortality rate was 3 per cent (of infected people). However, for the H5N1 virus or for Ebola, the rate can exceed 50–60 per cent.”

”Moreover, it seems that to date few people have become aware of the systemic aspect of things, and governments are turning out to be particularly inefficient at finding solutions.39 For their part, ‘international institutions are concentrating mainly on simple problems, ignoring the interactions of the entire system. Fighting against climate change through forest plantations, for example, can destroy the ecosystems targeted by the Convention on Biodiversity of the United Nations. [Or else] the promotion of biofuels can accelerate deforestation and erode the food security of poor countries’.40”

”When a civilization becomes ‘uprooted’ – in other words, when a majority of its inhabitants no longer have a direct link with the Earth system (earth, water, wood, animals, plants, etc.) – the population becomes entirely dependent on the artificial structure that maintains it in this state. If this ever more powerful but vulnerable structure collapses, it’s the survival of the entire population that may be endangered”
</p>

<br>

<p>
”To maintain itself and avoid financial disorder and social unrest, our industrial civilization is forced to accelerate, to become more complex and to consume ever more energy. Its dazzling expansion has been nurtured by the exceptional availability (though this will not last long) of fossil fuels that are very energy efficient, coupled with a growth economy and highly unstable levels of debt. But the growth of our industrial civilization, today constrained by geophysical and economic limits, has reached a phase of decreasing returns. Technology, which has long served to push these limits back, is less and less able to ensure this acceleration and ‘locks in’ this unsustainable trajectory by preventing the development of new alternatives.”
</p>

<br>

<p>
”The paradox that characterizes our era – and probably all eras when civilizations came up against limits and crossed boundaries – is that the more powerful our civilization grows, the more vulnerable it becomes. The modern globalized political, social and economic system, which provides half of humankind with life, has seriously depleted the resources and disrupted the systems on which it relied – the climate and ecosystems – to such an extent that it has dangerously undermined the conditions that formerly allowed it to expand and guarantee its stability and survival.”
</p>

<br>

<p>
”To preserve ourselves from serious disruptions to the climate and the ecosystems (the disruptions that threaten the species), we need to turn off the engine. The only route to follow if we are to find a safe space for ourselves, then, is to stop in its tracks the production and consumption of fossil fuels, as these lead to economic and probably political and social collapse, and ultimately to the end of thermo-industrial civilization”
</p>

<p>
”Today, we are sure of four things: (1) the physical growth of our societies will come to a halt in the near future; (2) we have irreversibly damaged the entire Earth system (at least on the geological scale of human beings); (3) we are moving towards a very unstable, ‘non-linear’ future, where major disruptions (internal and external) will be the norm; and (4) we are now potentially subject to global systemic collapses.”

”The example of the Ebola virus is interesting (in the following, the crises are in brackets): forest destruction (biodiversity) favoured the spread of the virus (health) but the number of people killed or rendered unfit for work and the measures to contain the disease have slowed down economic activity (economy) and seriously disrupted the supply networks (infrastructure) and harvests (food). The result is that less than six months after the epidemic broke out, more than a million people are threatened by hunger in West Africa1 and the Guinean health service is severely weakened [infrastructure].2”

”From risk assessment to intuition<br>
To try to predict and avoid disasters or systemic shocks similar to 2008, some experts including insurers are developing tools for risk assessment and management.

Most societies clearly do not have adequate and sufficient resources to assess these risks.”
</p>

<br>

<p>
”If by chance all these risks can be identified, their evaluation and mitigation require a certain transparency and accountability on the part of institutions and decision makers. Now, this is increasingly difficult to obtain in highly complex systems because the unintended or unknown consequences of each person’s individual actions increase considerably (this is also valid at the level of a state or an enterprise). This is the moral hazard: we behave as if we were not ourselves exposed to the risk. Some agents refuse to accept responsibility for their decisions but, more importantly, although their actions may be considered to be rational in normal times, they can lead to an inevitable collective failure.”<br>

”Worse, there are insurmountable theoretical obstacles. Science does not have the tools to predict everything, and will never have them, as there are events that it is impossible to predict – the famous ‘black swans’.6 As the philosopher, mathematician and former trader Nassim Nicholas Taleb explains, classical methods of risk assessment are of little relevance to the forecasting of rare events or the behaviour of complex systems. Devised by Bertrand Russell and taken up by Taleb, the celebrated ‘inductivist turkey problem’ illustrates this perfectly. For turkeys on a turkey farm, everything is the best in the best of all possible worlds: the breeder comes every day to scatter grain for them, and the temperature is always comfortable. The turkeys live in a world of growth and abundance … until Christmas Eve!”

”The global economy survived the 2008 crisis. We can infer that the system is hyper-resilient, or that it has become considerably weaker, but we cannot prove that it will collapse or not collapse. According to one distinction made in 1921 by two economists, Knight and Keynes,7 risks can be given a certain probability, whereas uncertainty can’t. Uncertainty is the territory of the black swans; it is not quantifiable. You can’t chart your way through it with Gauss curves and other risk-management tools. Moreover, confined within their disciplines, risk specialists see that ‘for each of the risks they focus on, it is unlikely that the future holds a major tragedy in store for us’.8”
</p>

<br>

<p>
”Now, our society doesn’t like uncertainty. It uses it as an obvious pretext for doing nothing, and society’s functioning rests on its ability to predict future events. When this ability evaporates, we seem disoriented and lose the ability to come up with real projects.<br>
So how are we to manage black swans? How are we to ‘manage’ the next ‘Fukushima’? We cannot really do so. Instead, we need to let go and move from the ‘observe, analyse, command and control’ mode to a ‘probe, act, sense, adjust’ mode.9 Open up reason to intuition. In collapsology, it is intuition – nurtured by solid knowledge – which will be paramount. All the information contained in this book, however objective it might be, does not therefore constitute formal proof that a major collapse will take place soon, it merely allows you to increase your knowledge so you can refine your intuition and finally act with conviction.”

”The paradoxes of collapse<br>
The reflections of the philosopher Jean-Pierre Dupuy are of great use in trying to understand the temporality of a collapse. After the attacks of 11 September 2001, something strange happened in the imaginations of people living in rich countries. Something clicked. ‘The worst horror is now possible, as many people have been saying.’ But, continues Dupuy, ‘if it is becoming possible, it is because it was not possible before. And yet – so common sense (?) objects – if it has occurred, it must have been possible.’ So we have experienced, as it were, an ‘irruption of the possible into the impossible’. Before, it existed only in the minds of a few novelists. After, it has passed from the world of the imagination into the real world.<br>
The philosopher Henri Bergson saw the same phenomenon in a work of art that, when it still does not exist, cannot be imaginable (otherwise it would have been created before). Thus the possibility of the artwork is created at the same time as the work. The time of catastrophes, explains Dupuy, involves this ‘inverse temporality’: the work, or the catastrophe, only becomes possible retrospectively. ‘That’s the source of our problem[…]”

”To solve this problem, Hans Jonas, in 1979, suggested that we listen more to prophecies of misfortune than to prophecies of happiness11 in situations which have a catastrophic potential. In the same vein, Dupuy proposes a posture – which he calls enlightened catastrophism – to chart a way through the uncertainty of disasters. For him, increasing threats are not to be viewed as fateful probabilities or risks but as certainties. If we view them as certainties, we will be better able to avoid them. ‘Unhappiness is our destiny, but it is a destiny only because human beings do not recognize in it the consequences of their own actions. Above all, it is a destiny we can choose to ward off.’12 Collapse is certain, and that is why it is not tragic. For, in saying that, we have just opened the possibility of avoiding its catastrophic consequences.”
</p>

<br>

<p>
”There is another temporal curiosity mentioned by Bergson, namely the fact that after the occurrence of a catastrophic event, this is not experienced as catastrophic but as banal. And Dupuy comments:<br>
The terrible thing about a catastrophe is that not only do we not believe it will happen even though we have every reason to know that it will happen, but once it has happened, it appears to be part of the normal order of things. Its reality makes it banal. It was not considered possible before it actually occurred; after, it is integrated without further ado into the ‘ontological furniture’ of the world, to speak the jargon of the philosophers.13”
</p>

<p>
”So a collapse could become our new normal, thus gradually losing its exceptional, i.e., catastrophic character. From then on, there is every likelihood that we will be able to describe the collapse of our civilization only when it is far too late, through the work of historians or archaeologists. And it is certain that these scholars will not agree on how to interpret this event.<br>
One last paradox: if, conversely, we predict a collapse too early – i.e., now – and too authoritatively, for example through an official speech given by a head of state, it then becomes possible to instil panic into the markets (or the populations) and create a self-fulfilling prophecy. This then raises the following strategic question: can all of us together prepare for it without triggering it? Should we talk about it in public? Can we do so?”

”The ‘noise’ of a system about to collapse<br>
One of the most frequently observed characteristics of a system ‘on the edge of the abyss’ is that it takes longer to recover from a small disruption. Its recovery time after a shock lengthens – in other words, its resilience decreases”
</p>

<p>
”Researchers call this ‘critical slowing down’, identifiable by complex mathematical indices based on series of temporary data (autocorrelation, dissymmetry, variance, etc.) which reveal a system’s state of fragility and therefore the possibility that it is about to reach a tipping point”
</p>

<br>

<p>
”in 2010, two researchers from the Universities of Georgia and South Carolina exposed populations of daphnia (zooplankton) to increasingly damaged conditions (a reduction in food availability) and clearly observed warning signals of population collapse: a critical slowdown in population dynamics appeared up to eight generations before the population collapse.2 Since then, similar findings have been observed for populations of yeast, cyanobacteria and aquatic ecosystems, but only in artificial and controlled conditions.3 In 2014, a team of British climatologists was even able to identify the warning signals that preceded the collapse of the Atlantic Ocean current over the course of the last million years, an event that, if it took place today, would drastically change our climate.4 But researchers still can’t say precisely whether these signals are currently being produced.”
</p>

<br>

<p>
”For the climate, for example, it has been observed that, at the end of a period of glaciation, temperature variations start going haywire and flickering before abruptly tipping over into a hot period.5 This subtle index also works for lake ecosystems6 but, although very reliable (it really does harbinger catastrophic changes), it only appears when it’s too late to avoid such changes.”
</p>

<br>

<p>
”In 2012, the discipline of warning signals benefited from major advances made by specialists in interaction networks, who are starting to clearly define the behaviour of very heterogeneous complex networks subjected to disruption.8 For example, in a flowering meadow, imagine the immense web of relations between all species of pollinators (bees, flies, butterflies, etc.) and all pollinated plant species, where some species are specialists (in one flower) and others are generalists”
</p>

<br>

<p>
”M. Scheffer et al., ‘Anticipating Critical Transitions,’ Science 338(6105), 2012: 344–8”
</p>

<p>
”More generally, it has been shown that complex networks are very sensitive to two factors: heterogeneity; and connectivity between their constituent elements9 (see Figure 7.1). A heterogeneous and modular network (weakly connected, with independent parts) will withstand shocks by adapting. It will suffer only local losses and will gradually become more and more damaged. On the other hand, a homogeneous and highly connected network initially resists change because local losses are absorbed through the connectivity between elements. But, then, if the disruptions continue, it will be subject to domino effects and therefore catastrophic changes. In reality, the apparent resilience of these homogeneous and connected systems is misleading as it hides a growing fragility. Like the oak, these systems are very resistant but break when the pressure is too great. Conversely, heterogeneous and modular systems are resilient; they bend but do not break. Like the reed, they adapt”
</p>

<p>
”These discoveries are fundamental when it comes to designing more resilient social systems, especially for finance and the economy. But even if the theory of networks adds greatly to our understanding of economic and social networks, there are still many obstacles to overcome before we can find reliable warning signals in them. Current indicators are not enough to predict the tipping points of social systems, given their complexity. Thus attempts to develop warning signals have for the moment failed, or no consensus on them has been reached.11 Of course, we still have relevant indicators based on economic fundamentals when the situation is ‘normal’ but, as thresholds approach, it becomes impossible to evaluate anything. Some people have looked for critical slowing-down signs for financial systems but have not found any. Instead, they have found other indices that are not yet generalizable.12 In short, for financial crises, the study of warning signals gives us a better grasp of how they work but does not make them any more predictable”

”There will always be uncertainty<br>
Science may make fantastic progress, but science will always come up against epistemological limits.13 In this race against the clock we will always be running late,14 as detecting a warning sign does not guarantee that the system has not already tipped over into another state.”

“in addition to the problems caused by exposure to high doses, there is the problem of chronic exposure at very low doses, potentially affecting almost everyone on Earth. In agriculture, when manure is spread, more than 90 per cent of the product is unabsorbed by plants and ends up in the soil where some may persist for many years, contaminating waters and migrating to untreated areas.82 Residues of insecticides (especially neonicotinoids, at present) cause collapses in insect populations, including bees,83 but also damage to vertebrates84 and finally to wildlife and agriculture.85”

“There are many ‘boundaries’ and we cannot discuss all of them in detail. This is not our aim. The idea we need to take away from this overview is that we are surrounded by boundaries. Whether we are talking about climate, other species, pollution or the availability of water, crossing any of these boundaries seriously affects the health and the economy of many human populations, including the populations of industrialized countries. Worse, the disruption of any one of the systems (the climate, for example) causes upheavals in the others (biodiversity, natural cycles, the economy, etc.), which in turn impact on others”

“Boundaries show us one thing: the great industrial machine, though remarkably efficient, becomes paradoxically ever more vulnerable as it grows and gains in power.”

Ch 8 What Do the Mathematical Models Say?
</p>

<p>
In his book How the Rich are Destroying the Earth,2 Hervé Kempf showed the close ties between inequality and consumption. The increase in economic disparities triggers an overall acceleration of consumption through a sociological phenomenon called ‘conspicuous consumption’, described for the first time by the sociologist Thorstein Veblen: every social class tends to do everything (and in particular to consume) so as to resemble the social class just above it. The poor strive to resemble the middle classes, and the latter seek to assume the attributes of the rich, who do everything to show that they are among the ‘seriously rich’. This phenomenon is so powerful that consumption can, in rich societies, become inseparable from the construction of personal identity. Stuck in a model of competition, the society sinks into this infernal spiral of consumption and depletion of resources.
</p>

<p>
The HANDY model is all the more relevant as our society is currently displaying all the symptoms of the inegalitarian society that consumes a great deal of resources as described in the model. Since the 1980s, inequalities have exploded. The problem is that we now have evidence that economic inequalities are very toxic to our society.
