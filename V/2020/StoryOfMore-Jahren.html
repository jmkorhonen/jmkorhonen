<p>
The poets of Babylon—Mesopotamia’s largest city—told how, soon after the advent of procreation, “the world teemed, the people multiplied, the world bellowed like a wild bull.” This drove the gods, deprived of sleep by the din of civilization, to cull human numbers by way of famine and disease, over and over again. These poems were written in about 1800 B.C., just as world population hit somewhere near one hundred million people. During the one thousand years that followed, global population doubled.

 Aristotle believed that politicians should decide “of what numbers and of what sort of people” a country should contain. Because “too large a multitude are incapable” of keeping themselves in good order, Aristotle recommended a suite of regulations on marriage, mainly directed toward controlling women’s behavior. Within his treatise Politics, he specified that women should not marry too early (“for women

<p>
A medieval abbot named Suger is credited as the founder of Gothic architecture, but his actual goal was to raise money. He wanted to enlarge the Basilica of Saint-Denis in order to accommodate the drastic increase in penitents
</p>

<p>
He described a church entrance so crowded that it “forced women to run to the altar on the heads of men as on a pavement,” leaving miscellaneous faithful bloodied on the floor. Suger wrote this in 1148, when the world population was about one-half billion people. Within the next five hundred years, global population doubled yet
</p>

<p>
Fifty years after Malthus sounded the alarm, John Stuart Mill expanded Malthus’s food-security argument to include less tangible goods and services, wringing his hands over the broader economic “penalty attached to over-population.” He spelled out his idea of our collective zero-sum game within the Principles of Political Economy: “A greater number of people can not, in any given state of civilization, be collectively so well provided for as a smaller.” He insisted these things during 1848, just as world population approached 1.5 billion people. And within the next century, the global population doubled again.
</p>

<p>
There’s a pattern here that suggests the vocal disapprobation of overpopulation is not sufficient, in and of itself, to stanch population growth. One thing that these great thinkers never explored, however, is the correlation between the status of a woman within her society and the average number of children she bears within her lifetime.
</p>

<p>
Of the world’s ten countries with the lowest gender gap (that is, the least difference between male and female health, opportunity, and participation), seven are also considered high-income relative to the rest of the world. Conversely, six of the ten countries with the highest gender gap (that is, those with the most difference between male and female health, opportunity, and participation) fall into the low-income categories. Whether this suggests that wealth gives rise to, or is a product of, female health, opportunity, and participation is not clear; it could be a combination of both.
</p>

<p>
These data also imply that closing the gender gap around the world would likely result in something near replacement-level fertility: that is, a stable global population that neither increases nor decreases. This best-case scenario means that barring something awful—famine, plague, genocide, or forced control over reproduction—Earth will never again contain fewer than seven billion people. We must learn to live together if we want to live well.
</p>

<p>
An American economist named Henry George gravely opposed Malthusian doctrine on the grounds that it “shelters selfishness from question and from conscience.” The way he saw things, the true cause of poverty among the masses was “the rapacity of man” and not the inadequacy of nature.
</p>

<p>
Henry George was a humble and pious man; he had known poverty and lived modestly even after success. He believed that intelligence should both inspire sympathy and seek justice. George was ahead of his time in many ways, advocating for public transportation, labor unions, and a half-female Congress during the nineteenth century, but the public loved him. More than a hundred thousand mourners attended his funeral after he died in 1897. It also turns out that Henry George, out of all these important men, was the one who came the closest to being right about population growth.
</p>

<p>
<div style='padding-left: 90pt'>
 The doubling of global population that has occurred since the time of Henry George was accompanied by a tripling of grain production, a tripling in fish production, and a quadrupling in meat production.
</div>
</p>

<p>
Henry George was also right in that most of the want and suffering that we see in our world today originates not from Earth’s inability to provide but from our inability to share, as we’ll see so many times in later pages. It is because so many of us consume far beyond our needs that a great many more of us are left with almost nothing.
</p>

<p>
the enormous consumption of food and fuel by just 10 percent of us is actively threatening Earth’s ability to produce the basics of life for the other 90 percent. Most political discussions of climate change are predicated on the hope that this may be reversible; the truth is that it may not.

If you have to look back more than eight generations to find a farmer, or a rancher, or a trapper, then you and your lineage are extremely rare and conspicuously urbane. In 1817, only 3 percent of the global population lived in any kind of a city. Now, just two hundred years later, about half of the people on planet Earth reside in cities
</p>

<p>
A high density of people translates into the possibility of concentrated human labor: Henry George was right, back in 1881, when he wrote that as new people arrive, “the hands they bring with them can in the natural order of things produce more.” The history of cities dating back to ancient Alexandria reveals libraries, construction projects, transportation systems, bazaars, hospitals, bureaucracies, judiciaries, and myriad other enterprises that could never have been endeavored within low-density population settings. Cities always have been, and always will be, places where people come together in an attempt to divide and multiply their labor.

half century, just over one billion people either moved into, or were born into, a city that already contained more than one million people. I was one of the multitude who migrated into the city, and we all did it for more or less the same reason: in hopes of finding opportunities that we did not see at home.

Today, the farm fields of my home county produce over three times more food than they did when I was born in 1969. Likewise, the farm fields of planet Earth produce three times more food than they did in 1969. A planet that once produced one billion tons of cereal each year now produces three billion tons. More amazing still is that the amount of land under cultivation has not significantly increased in America over that same time period, nor has it much increased all over the world.
</p>

<p>
After the introduction of these transgenic crops during the 1990s, the global yields of corn and soybeans increased by at least another 30 percent and are now more than quadruple what they were at the beginning of the twentieth century.<br>

 Every year, more and more GMO crops are being adopted around the world. Is it prudent that the literal seeds of global food production should rest in the hands of fewer than five American companies, to sell or withhold as they see fit?

In 1998, there was just one recognized species of glyphosate-resistant weed; today there are more than fifteen. Pesticides, like all antibiotic substances, become less potent as their targets evolve tolerance to the toxin that they employ, and so emerges the age-old feedback: the more we rely upon them, the less effective they become.

Thanks to the stunning work of a few thousand dedicated scientists, every single cow, pig, and chicken slaughtered the world over is, on average, between 20 and 40 percent bigger than it was in 1969. More meat from less biology is the unlikely prize conferred by the convergence of a bewildering assortment of seemingly contradictory characteristics, including quick maturation, high fertility, and low metabolism.
</p>

<p>
During the 1950s, a calf commonly passed the one-hundred-pound mark during its third month of life; today, they routinely break two hundred pounds in just fifty days. Today’s milk cow produces more than six gallons of milk each day, which is both double the amount of fifty years ago and a statistic that can only be fully appreciated by someone who has spent time breastfeeding another being.<br>

It took me some time to convince my journalist friend that when her Ukrainian host stopped his car beside that paddock, he wasn’t doing it in order to show her an animal. He was showing her three years of hard work.<br>
<div style='padding-left: 90pt'>
 There’s no such thing as a low-maintenance farm. A healthy steer, ready for slaughter, first gestated inside a heifer that required extra feed and tending for the 280 days of its pregnancy. After the calf was born, it required gelding, and after that came eighteen months of hauling hay, shoveling manure, moving pasture, fixing fences, watering, deworming, and—at the end—fattening. When my friend’s guide chose his sister’s wedding feast as the destination for all that meat, he was also gifting her the years of labor that he had performed in order to bring that steer up to the knife.

<p>
A full 30 percent of the fresh water used by humans on planet Earth is spent in the production, maintenance, and slaughter of meat animals. The twenty-five billion cows, pigs, and chickens that live in captivity while waiting to be slaughtered are given medicine in vast amounts. As of 1990, two-thirds of the antibiotics used in the United States are fed to meat animals, ostensibly to promote growth and decrease mortality, though studies have shown that they don’t work for

<p>
In the world today, a billion tons of grain are eaten by humans while at the same time, a different billion tons of grain are offered to animals as feed. From all this feed, we get about one hundred million tons of meat and three hundred million tons of feces.
</p>

<p>
Even inside these contraptions, six pounds of grain fed to an animal results in only one pound of meat that may be harvested, as a rule.
</p>

<p>
 the thirty-six countries of the OECD (including North America, Europe, Israel, Australia, New Zealand, and Japan) together decreased their meat consumption by half, the world’s food-grain supply would get bumped up by almost 40 percent. Or to put it another way: If the entire OECD adopted the habit of just one meatless day per week, an extra 120 million tons of grain would be available to feed the hungry this very

<p>
Starvation is caused by our failure to share what we produce, not by the earth’s ability to provide. Even with meat production siphoning off one-third of the world’s edible grain supply, we still produce twenty-nine hundred calories of food for every one of the seven and a half billion people on Earth, every single day—that’s more than enough to supply the per capita energy requirements for a healthy life, as set forth by the USDA.<br>

Humanity has been in this exact jam before, back in 1950 when it became clear that the global population would eventually exceed four billion, and we wriggled out of it by vastly increasing yields. Now we find ourselves staring down the barrel of a long century having already played that ace. Science fiction notwithstanding, there is only so much corn that can be hung from a stalk and only so much meat that can be balanced on a backbone—we are running up against the biological limits of what our food can be. Sooner or later we will have to reconsider the fact that every year, we actively waste 90 percent of the grain we feed to animals, in exchange for a little meat and a lot of manure.
</p>

<p>
All is fish that cometh to net.<br>
<div style='padding-left: 120pt'>
 —Sixteenth-century English proverb
</div>
</p>

<p>
Today’s fleet, equipped with state-of-the-art Global Positioning Systems and underwater sensing equipment, captures the same amount of fish as did the fleet of fifty years ago but uses only one-third as many people and a lot fewer boats while doing so. In its own way, Norway’s fishing industry was even more amazing back in 1970, when forty-three thousand Norwegians were bringing in 4 percent of the world’s fish without the benefit of modern machinery or satellite-assisted navigation.
</p>

<br>

<p>
When I was a kid in the 1970s, the global annual production of Atlantic salmon was consistently about thirteen thousand tons per year. Today, global production is getting close to three million tons—which means that production has increased by more than 20,000 percent. When I was growing up, salmon was fancy-dancy cuisine compared with cod or pollack or almost any whitefish. My relatives didn’t serve salmon very often, and when they did, we had to eat all of it—even the skin (yuck). Nowadays you can buy salmon at McDonald’s (at least in Singapore). What happened?
</p>

<p>
Thus 1990 marked a major shift in fishing all around the globe, not just in Norway. Between 1990 and today, global seafood production has doubled, but the amount of fish pulled from the ocean has not changed. More than half of the fish eaten worldwide is now produced through aquaculture. This forms an important contribution to the spectacular increase in our ability to produce food during the last fifty years: it is the fishing counterpart to the increase in crop yields and meat production that we saw in chapters 5 and 6.<br>
<div style='padding-left: 90pt'>
 In 1969, the people of planet Earth ate about forty million tons of seafood, 85 percent of it as fish. Today, the total amount of seafood eaten each year is three times higher, but much more of it is now consumed as shrimp, crab, oysters, and other delicacies that were six times less common in the supermarket fifty years ago. The majority of these foods come from aquaculture;
</div>
</p>

<p>
This great shift in how we acquire fish has not only changed what we can eat from the ocean, it also threatens to change what can live in the ocean. The relatively short digestive tract within fish means they require food that is very high in protein, compared with animals that live on land. To supply this protein, aquaculture facilities use a feed made from smaller fish that have been cooked, pressed, dried, and ground into meal. All of these small fish come from the open ocean.<br>
<div style='padding-left: 90pt'>
 To get one pound of salmon, you need three pounds of fish meal. To get a pound of fish meal, you need to grind up five pounds of fish. Thus, each pound of cage-raised salmon “costs” fifteen pounds of fish from the ocean. At present, about one-third of the total catch fished out of the ocean is ground up into fish meal and then fed to fish that live in pens.
</div>
</p>

<p>
The most optimistic aquaculture experts reckon that it is probably sustainable to pull about thirty million tons of forager fish out of the ocean each year without collapsing the food chain. Right now, we’re at about 75 percent of that figure. The United Nations estimates that humanity will want to consume an additional twenty million tons of fish, over and above today’s level, by the year 2030. If we produce these fish by aquaculture at today’s rate of efficiency, we’ll need to be pulling something like twenty-eight million tons of forager fish from the ocean
</p>

<p>
The global increase in seaweed production due to the advent of industrial-scale aquaculture during the last forty-odd years is even more spectacular than that for fish. In 1969, just under two million tons of seaweed were harvested and marketed from the world’s oceans; today, that number is closer to twenty-five million tons.
</p>

<p>
Seaweed is used to produce “hydrocolloids”: very large molecules that dissolve in water to make a viscous solution. There are three main types: alginate, agar, and carrageenan; all are low-calorie carbohydrates that can be used to thicken almost any solution. Today, more often than not, when we purchase ice cream, whipped cream, and salad dressing, they were made using recipes that rely upon extracts of soy and seaweed to approximate the properties we associate with milk, eggs, and cream.
</p>

<br>

<p>
Seaweed hydrocolloids are partially responsible for something that is everywhere now but used to be rare when I was a kid: a package of food that can sit for years and wait for someone to eat it—and when it is finally opened, it is exactly as palatable as it was on the day it was sealed shut. As a result, candy, cakes, pies, and doughnuts are rarely more than a few hundred meters away from us thanks to convenience stores and vending machines. But there’s another chemical, invented in 1969, that has since swamped the way we eat and, especially, the way we drink.

<p>
The development of high-fructose corn syrup will have no significant impact on either world sweetener consumption or on world trade in sugar.<br>
<div style='padding-left: 120pt'>
 —Journal of Agricultural Economics (1978
</div>
</p>

<p>
When women began to work outside the home, the hours available for meeting domestic demands dwindled, and time-consuming activities such as baking got cut under the sensible rationale that they had mostly yielded treats, after all. Accordingly, the record of white sugar purchased per household shows a plummeting trend between 1950 and 1975. Across that same time period, however, the total amount of sugar that the average American consumed each day increased.
</p>

<p>
Table sugar forms when two chemicals join together like a butterfly, one wing made of glucose and the other wing made of fructose. This butterfly, purified from sugar cane or sugar beet plants, is what Americans brought home in five-pound bags during the 1950s and regarded as a staple for their larders, but today it is no longer the dominant sugar of the American
</p>

<p>
In 1972, a horrible drought parched the vast farm fields of what is now Russia; its breadbasket region, Ukraine, was particularly hard-hit. Normal precipitation did not resume for years, and sugar-beet harvests suffered tremendously. To offset these shortages, the U.S.S.R. sought to import both grain and sugar from the outside world and entered the global marketplace for the first time in decades.<br>
<div style='padding-left: 90pt'>
 On the heels of the drought in Russia, Hurricane Carmen blazed through the tropics, seven thousand miles away. She pummeled her way across the Caribbean Sea and into the Gulf of Mexico, devastating the sugarcane fields of Puerto Rico and Louisiana. During the years that followed, low global supply met with high global demand, and Americans witnessed a horrifying spike in table sugar prices. Behind the scenes of this chaos, American exports of a seemingly unrelated commodity quietly doubled in value. That commodity was cornstarch.
</div>
</p>

<p>
Cornstarch is a chemical with a very simple structure, hundreds of repeating molecules, all in a line, like a string of paper angels for a Christmas tree. In the 1960s, Japanese food scientists perfected a method to slice cornstarch into its individual units, and a second method to twist glucose molecules into fructose. Interestingly, the end product was a syrupy sugar, not a crystalline one—a syrup containing extra fructose relative to table sugar. They named this product high-fructose corn syrup, more simply known as HFCS.
</p>

<p>
<div style='padding-left: 90pt'>
 Flustered by the 1974 sugar shortage, America turned full throttle to producing HFCS from corn, a crop that it had always grown in great abundance. It didn’t take many years for America to become the world’s largest producer of HFCS; by 1982, the United States was exporting more than a thousand tons per year. HFCS began to displace table sugar consumption, and today, one out of every three calories from sugar in the American diet is consumed as HFCS.
</div>
</p>

<p>
<div style='padding-left: 30pt'>
 The truth is that HFCS is superior to table sugar for many purposes. Crystalline sugar has a nasty habit of hydrolyzing when mixed with acids, which is a fancy way to say that it tastes funny and turns brown. Not only is HFCS free from this trait, it’s also hygroscopic, which means that it holds moisture, thus helping to maintain the appearance of freshness over time—perfect for packaged treats that must wait for months, or even years, to be selected from a gas station shelf or the inside of a vending machine.
</div>
<div style='padding-left: 90pt'>
 Most important, HFCS is a ready-to-dissolve liquid, making it an ideal sweetener for beverage manufacture. As the benefits of HFCS took hold, its production skyrocketed, and the amount of American corn set aside each year for milling into starch increased dramatically. In 2001, Americans were manufacturing more than nine million tons of HFCS per year from cornstarch and consuming 95 percent of it as convenience foods and sweetened beverages.
</div>
</p>

<p>
There are good arguments on both sides: HFCS has effectively loaded the American diet with fructose, and high rates of fructose intake have been shown to disrupt fat and insulin metabolism in animals. On the other hand, as HFCS intake increased, physical activity did not increase, leading to a simple excess of calories.

<p>
About 10 percent (by mass) of the food that you eat exits your body as solid waste. It has been thoroughly transformed, of course, and contains a large number of bacteria that did you a huge favor by helping you to digest what you ate. Living well requires a massive population of these bacteria in your gut, but you’ll get very sick if even a small population gets near your mouth. The average adult produces about two pounds of feces and four gallons of urine each week, and all of it must be transported far away from the point of production and rendered innocuous more or less immediately.
</p>

<p>
It’s true that the total population of Philadelphia hasn’t changed much since 1980, but on average, Americans eat 15 percent more food each day, which translates into 15 percent more…well, you get my drift.
</p>

<p>
As far as sewers go, however, even the worst ones in America are superior to the global average. Back in chapter 2, I first exposed you to the fact that global population has doubled since 1969. This also means that the amount of human waste produced on planet Earth has more than doubled, given that food consumption has increased greatly within many regions. Our ability to deal with this waste has not kept up, and today, a larger number of people than ever before live within conditions of inadequate sanitation.<br>
<div style='padding-left: 90pt'>
 At present, more than two billion people on planet Earth have no access to any system that would remove and sanitize the human excrement produced where they live. Similarly, about one billion people live without access to drinking water that has been fully purified of sewage.
</div>
</p>

<p>
large fraction of the world has yet to share in even the most rudimentary benefits conferred during our decades-long global pursuit of more.
</p>

<p>
<div style='padding-left: 90pt'>
 Any analysis of rotting waste quickly broadens to include refuse far beyond human excrement. In addition to their massive output of human waste, the homes, schools, businesses, and hospitals of the United States, all taken together, generate about eighty million tons of organic waste each year in the form of discarded fruits and vegetables, other food scraps, and garden clippings. The total for all of the OECD countries is about 150 million tons per year, and the total for all the other people on Earth, combined, is close to four hundred million tons per year.

The more we eat, the more we waste: in 1970, each American wasted one-third pound of food each day, on average. Today, that figure is two-thirds of a pound. Twenty percent of what American families send to the landfill each day is, or recently was, perfectly edible food.

 I am honestly unsure whether to feel more depressed or hopeful about it, but the magnitude of our global waste is in many ways equal to our need. The amount of total grain that is wasted is close to the annual food supply of grain available in India. The amount of fruits and vegetables that is wasted each year exceeds the annual food supply of fruits and vegetables for the entire continent of Africa. We live in an age when we can order a pair of tennis shoes from a warehouse on the other side of the planet and have them shipped to a single address in less than twenty-four hours; don’t tell me that a global food redistribution is impossible.

That half-eaten meal in the garbage—why did we plow that field? Why did we plant those seeds, and water them, and fertilize the soil, and thwart the weeds? Why did we drive the harvester, run the thresher, fill the silo? Why did we deliver the calf from the cow? Herd it to the feedlot? Carry it in pieces from the conveyor belt? Why do we fix the refrigerators, and design the labels, and calculate the vitamin C content, and pave the roads, and change the carburetors so that we can drive,

We spend our lives on these labors—we wake in the morning and leave our homes and we work, work, work, to keep the great global chain of procurement in place. Then we throw 40 percent of everything we just accomplished into the garbage.<br>

 We can never get those hours back. Our children grow up, our bodies wane, and death comes to claim some of those we love. All the while, we spend our days making things for the purpose of discarding them. When we cast food into the landfill, we are losing more than calories: we are throwing away one another’s lives. It is the ultimate demonstration of how our relentless pursuit of more has landed us, empty and exhausted, squarely in the middle of less.

 like to talk about boiling water in my classroom, because it’s something familiar, and the best lessons always start from shared experience. “Suppose you want a cup of tea,” I posit, “how many different ways are there to heat the water?” I make a list on the board as I call on each raised hand. An electric kettle, a gas stove, and a microwave are suggested right away, but I ask for still more. A driftwood campfire, offers somebody, and then someone else mentions a coal-fed barbecue. When I taught in Hawaii, students often speculated that there should be some way to usefully boil water by exposing it to hot lava; others knew that you can focus a sunbeam to start a fire and asked whether the heat could be used to warm something but not burn it.
</p>

<br>

<p>
Many ways to skin the same cat,” I end the lesson, pointing to our list, “many different strategies for obtaining the same result.” I close with the moral of the story: “The requirements for each technique are different—electricity, gas, wood, coal, sun—but the result is the same: energy for boiling water.

President Jimmy Carter ordered us to turn down the thermostat and put a sweater on, just as he did at the White House. After Ronald Reagan moved in, energy efficiency—not conservation—became the name of the game. During the decades that followed, our labor-saving machines (particularly cars, as we’ll see in chapter 11) were successfully engineered to produce more work from less fuel. Since then, we have aggressively offset what could have led to a global decrease in energy consumption by vastly increasing the level of energy use within almost every sphere of our daily lives.

 They usually compile at least ten entries before their breakfast ends: flipping on the light switch, using a hair dryer, plugging in the toaster and the coffee maker, and so on. But many of them have given up by dinner, overwhelmed trying to document the barrage of tasks that fill their days at school, at work, and on errands. There’s plenty of items that they miss: the streetlights at which they stop and go, the water heater that warms their shower, and the array of battery-assisted devices including not just phones and laptops but everything from the clock on the wall to the speedometer on the dashboard.

Thirty years ago, there were more than one billion people on planet Earth who had no access to electricity. Today, there are still more than one billion people on planet Earth who have no access to electricity. Because the global population has increased by 40 percent over that same time period, the total percentage of people living in poverty has decreased significantly. Nevertheless, the population that suffers from want is still very large; one out of ten people on planet Earth lives in abject poverty.
</p>

<p>
In contrast, the labor of the one billion people living in sub-Saharan Africa is valued at under $2 trillion. This translates into 13 percent of the world’s population producing just 2 percent of the world’s value. Half a century ago, when I was born, the labor of sub-Saharan Africa was also valued at just 2 percent of the world’s total.<br>
<div style='padding-left: 90pt'>
 A different kind of trouble has beset the citizens of India, yet another billion people. Since I was born in 1969, the total value of the goods and services produced each year in India has exploded: it has increased by more than 1,000 percent, while the population of India has only doubled. Despite this explosion in market value, the key indicators of poverty have changed very little in India. Thirty years ago, one out of every five people living without clean water and one out of every three people living without a sanitary sewer system lived in India; today, those figures are still the same.
</div>
</p>

<p>
there are hundreds of millions of Indian citizens who have yet to receive any benefit from the global wealth that is pouring into India.<br>
<div style='padding-left: 90pt'>
 India and sub-Saharan Africa are similar, in that both regions consume very little of the world’s energy. Together, they make up one-third of the world’s population but consume less than 10 percent of the world’s electricity. The vast majority of the world’s people with no access to electricity live in India and sub-Saharan Africa. If you had to light a fire every time you needed to cook or clean, and there was no lamp to switch on after the sun went down, how would you go to school or study? It is perhaps not surprising that most adult women who never learned to read also live in India and sub-Saharan Africa.
</div>

<p>
This extreme imbalance in energy consumption inspires a simple sort of algebra: if all the fuel and electricity in use today were redistributed equally to each of the seven-plus billion people on planet Earth, each person’s energy use could be equal to the average consumed by people living in Switzerland during the 1960s. I’ve seen pictures of Switzerland that were taken in the sixties, and you know what? It doesn’t look so bad. People standing around in train stations wearing thick wool coats or sitting at small tables drinking from tiny coffee cups. What we saw in chapter 6 with food, we now see with energy: all of the want and suffering in the world—all of it—arises not from the earth’s inability to produce but from our inability to share.
</p>

<p>
What was only a faint drumbeat as I began to research this book now rings in my head like a mantra: Use Less and Share More. As we’ll see in chapter 13, there is no magical technology coming to save us from ourselves. Curbing consumption will be the ultimate trial of the twenty-first century. Using less and sharing more is the biggest challenge our generation will ever face.

If, instead of flying, all two hundred of us escaped from the plane into two hundred separate cars and drove, individually, from New Jersey to Minnesota, we would have collectively burned 40 percent less fuel than we ended up using for that one plane by flying all together. If instead of using separate cars we had boarded a single passenger train, the total journey would have required only half as much fuel as was required for the gas-guzzling airplane that saved each one of us fourteen hours of travel time.

Routinely traveling very long distances has somehow become an ordinary thing, even though it was inconceivable to our grandparents. In 1970, the world’s airlines carried just over three hundred million people each year, and almost 90 percent of these flights departed from, or landed in, OECD countries. Today, a global fleet of twenty-five thousand airplanes touches down thirty-five million times each year onto the runways of the world’s forty thousand airports. In doing so, these planes move almost four billion passengers away from home and back again. Ten times the number of people will be long-hauled by airplane this year compared with 1970, so that we can work or play against a change of scenery, at least for a little while.

 High-speed rail—that is, passenger trains that exceed speeds of 120 miles per hour—is the only industry able to compete with the airlines for long-distance travel, but consumers tend to choose flying when the extra time necessary for land travel exceeds thirty minutes.

The statement above is not quite fair, not only because railway options do not exist everywhere but also because many of the railroads that do exist are in serious decline. Trains are being decommissioned en masse: the total number of locomotives in the world has been slashed by 17 percent in the last twenty years, even as population increased by almost 20 percent. In most countries (with the exception of China), the amount of train track available has not changed meaningfully during the last forty years, which means that as the world’s cities have grown, our ability to move within and between them by rail has not.

 Perhaps more important, the global workforce that maintains and operates our railroads has been gutted: in the last twenty years, one out of every four of the world’s railroad jobs has been eliminated, mostly during the course of privatization. The United States, which has never enjoyed a vigorous passenger railroad system outside of the New York–DC corridor, has declined substantially: since 1991, one out of every seven railroad jobs has been eliminated. The United Kingdom’s railroads have fared worse, in that one out of every three railroad jobs disappeared over that same period; and Spain has decimated its railroads, having eliminated four out of every five railroad jobs in the last thirty years.

America’s auto engineers redesigned the passenger car toward alleviating this dependence, and by 1980, the average car engine was 50 percent more efficient and got about twenty miles per gallon, mostly because the cars themselves were, on average, 20 percent lighter than they had been just five years earlier (it takes less fuel to move less metal).
</p>

<p>
<div style='padding-left: 90pt'>
 Combustion engines were greatly improved during the 1970s, and massive benefits emerged from the car industry’s quixotic quest for perfect fuel efficiency. Airplanes were made 40 percent more fuel efficient between 1970 and 1980, and after oil prices descended to their previous levels, airlines expanded vigorously to welcome an ever-broadening swath of America on board for long-distance travel.

Today’s automobiles average about 230 horsepower—more than ten times the poor old Model T and more than double the average of the 1980s. The average weight of American automobiles rose sharply as families put minivans and SUVs and pickup trucks into daily commuter use. By the year 2000, the highways were filled with vehicles every bit as heavy as the Lincoln Continentals and Ford Gran Torinos of the seventies, and at twenty-three miles per gallon, average fuel efficiency was actually lower than it had been twenty years earlier.

Americans bought still more cars and kept driving them, and today they travel twice as far by car each year as they did in 1970.

This was called the Panthalassa Sea, and I am certain that the creatures swimming in it believed their watery world to be the entire Universe, extending forever in every direction. The creatures of the Panthalassa were different from the ones we recognize in our oceans: jawless fish writhed in great schools, their wormy bodies streaming behind them as they searched for places to attach. Innumerable cartilage forms swam, forever in motion, their gill slits pumping as they moved. Spiral-shelled squids jetted back and forth, contracting and squirting their way along. Sea lilies swayed, tethered to the bottom by their roots, their animal petals filter feeding on the small and weak that floated by.

<p>
The Forest of Ruhr grew lush for millions of years; it was one of the earth’s first tropical rain forests. Eventually, it was buried under the accumulating sands of time. Crushed and rotted, the sludge descended into the deep, where heat and pressure transformed what had once been leaves and stems into black, blocky coal. All the while, the entire continent was pushed and pulled until its heaving journey stranded it far from home, on the other side of the globe.
</p>

<br>

<p>
The plant and animal corpses of the Forest of Ruhr, the Tethys Ocean, and the Panthalassa Sea now constitute the coal deposits of Germany, the petroleum crude oil of Saudi Arabia, and the natural gas deposits of North Dakota, respectively. The largest coal reserve in western Europe was once a tropical forest; the crude oil that gushes from the world’s most productive oil wells once lined a shallow ocean; the natural gas collected during today’s fracking boom once anchored a deep abyssal sea.

To some extent this is working, at least for Brazil, which is able to support itself while importing one-tenth the amount of oil imported by the United States. The United States, on the other hand, imports exactly as much oil as it did in the 1990s, before biofuel technologies really took off. Like most energy innovations of the last one hundred years, development of the corn-ethanol biofuel has simply been used to facilitate increased fuel consumption.
</p>

<p>
 the United States gave up fossil fuels cold turkey and relied 100 percent on biofuels, its current annual biofuel production would last about six days. The story is worse for the European Union: they’d last three days. Brazil could go a little longer—about three weeks, by my calculation. But none of these nations produce enough biofuel to do any more than just take the edge off of their fossil fuel dependency, though they are channeling a large portion of their national agriculture into the effort.

There’s really only one thing that all of Earth’s life-forms have in common: their insides burn. Every living organism, from the single-celled microbe to the cheerful daisy flower to the hundred-ton whale, is capable of burning plant tissues (yes, plants can burn their own tissues!). The human body is very good at burning plants: we harvest energy from the breakdown of sugars, proteins, and fats within the plants that we eat or within the animals that we eat (animals who ate plants, after all). We use this energy to fuel our bodies, to run, walk, talk, think, breathe, and everything else that we do.

Multiple schemes offer people an offset of the carbon dioxide produced when they fly by paying money for trees to be planted. This is an appealing concept—after all, who doesn’t like the idea of more forest?—but the numbers are not as favorable as you might think. First of all, the rewards are slow to kick in, as most seedlings take decades to grow into a respectable tree. Furthermore, trees don’t permanently incorporate much carbon dioxide into their tissues, as most of the leaves and needles that fall to the ground each year shrivel up and decay, releasing carbon dioxide right back up into the atmosphere. The most stable stash of fixed carbon dioxide in the forest is the tiny percentage of rotted plant material that makes it into the soil, and new soil takes hundreds to thousands of years to form. Planting trees will offset your energy use, but it won’t pay off during your lifetime and possibly not during your children’s lifetimes,
