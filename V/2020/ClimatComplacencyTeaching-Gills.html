<p>
Economics is "socialisation via education" (Daly &amp; Morgan 2019), with "framing" effects (Lakoff 2010)
</p>

<p>
"In this paper we want to draw attention to the systematic failure of mainstream economics to adequately incorporate the real consequences of economic activity. Economic activity involves material processes that affect the world on which our existence depends, and yet mainstream economics does not take this reality as its fundamental point of departure."
</p>

<p>

</p>

<h2>Mainstream econ theory key source of authority for environmental complacency</h2>

<br>

<p>
"...mainstream economic theory has been one of the main sources of authority responsible for climate action delay and environmental complacency, and this has been the case across the whole array of possible environmental problems, not just on emissions and climate change."
</p>

<p>
"...to an ecological economist an economy is a set of material processes, it involves thermodynamic consequences, entropy, waste creation, and basic bio-physical modification of the world around us (see Spash, 2017)."
</p>

<h2>Mainstream econ focuses on exchange values</h2>

<br>

<p>
"Fundamentally, to an ecological economist, the economy is embedded (as is society more broadly) in the material world, and the economy evolves as a sub-system in mutual relation with the material world on which it (and thus we) <i>depend</i>.
</p>

<p>
In mainstream economics, by contrast, the focus is determination of <i>exchange values</i> in an economic system of measured wealth creation (O'Neill, 2007). In mainstream economics, organizations provide goods and services according to production costs of labour and capital and in relation to subjective preferences of customers or consumers. Supply and demand are expressed in marginal relations and the two are resolved through convergence on prices some will pay and profits others will earn, based on what some will pay. This occurs in one market and generalizes to all markets. <b>According to such theory, when left to run unimpeded, the result is a system where 'price signals' and profit motives provide an engine of economic development and economic growth (presumably) to the benefit of all. This is the foundational premise, or ideological framing, by mainstream economics of the 'system.'</b> The 'system is focused on meeting subjective preferences and earning further profits in a competitive process that induces organizations to innovate, reduce costs, struggle for market share, and to identify new unexploited or currently non-existent markets, leading to technological progress and 'dynamic efficiency' (doing more in aggregate, but with 'less' and meeting more needs or wants: in an utilitarian virtuous circle. At a macro-level this 'system' is represented through a 'circular flow of income' with a focus on national income accounts and a set of standard metrics that measure how well a (national) economy is doing in terms of economic growth, according to the dictates of exchange values."
</p>

<h2>Environment reduced to resources used in solving problems of relative scarcity</h2>

<br>

<p>
<b>"The important point, however, is that the 'environment' in this schema is reduced to resources used in solving problems of </b><i>relative scarcity</i> <b>and allocation as an economy evolves (and this is mainly about valuations, costs, and 'substitution' choices between resources."</b> 
</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li>assumes that material processes are adequately accounted for through the exchange valuation system, i.e. what we pay</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>

</p>

<h2>Environmental issues are just a specialist sub-discipline that formulates solutions within the mainstream framework</h2>

<br>

<p>
<ul>
<li>"environmental issues" are therefore not seen as fundamental to the theorization of an economy, but just as an additional specialist sub-discipline for "environmental economists", whose job it has been to theorize "the environment" BUT, IMPORTANTLY, by adapting their concepts from within the framework of mainstream economics
<ul>
<li>therefore, the context in which problems are recognized and policy solutions are formulated flow FROM this mainstream framework
<ul>
<li>focus is on resource choice, substitution decisions, distortions to and failures in otherwise (presumably) efficient processes of exchange valuation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>ecological science remains marginal to the foundations of mainstream economics</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>Key point: despite an economy being fundamentally a material process, this is not a focus of mainstream economics</h2>

<br>

<p>
"The key point to take from the above is that despite an economy being fundamentally a <i>material process</i>, material processes and consequences are <i>not</i> what mainstream economics directly orients on. Moreover, there is no acknowledgement that economic expansion has <i>inherent</i> material limits dictated by the material world or actual existing planetary system. 
</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li>there is a tacit assumption that the economic system is without absolute limits</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
"As ecological economists argue, the lack of real biophysical planetary limits might have seemed like less of an omission when the world's population was small and there were only a few industrialized countries, and relatively few people living high consumption lives"<br>
<ul>
<li>thouygh classical political economy did speculate on limits of growth; see Dale 2020</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>...not interested in gravity!</h2>

<br>

<p>
"Today, however, when pointed out to them, it seems genuinely weird to non-economists that economics lacks <i>primary </i>and <i>universal</i> attention to the materiality of the economy and the actual material consequences of growth. This is the equivalent of finding out that cosmologists are not interested in gravity! (Daly &amp; Morgan 2019)"
</p>

<p>

</p>

<h2>Received framework and law-like conditions</h2>

<br>

<p>
"Standard introductory undergraduate economics textbooks tend to conform to the template pioneered and popularized by Paul Samuelson in his 1948 book Economics... As critics and authors of heterodox alternatives often note, mainstream economics textbooks are unusual in the social sciences... Most social science textbooks set out a series of issue areas and emphasize that there are enduring disputes and competing theories and perspectives. In other words, they recognize an open field of studies, characterized by contestation and debate, rather than a received framework presumably representing a scientific consensus regarding underlying law-like conditions."
</p>

<p>
"Indeed, some critics note that the aspiration and self-representation to reproduce the 'rigour' of the natural sciences is one of the defining characteristics as well as fundamental flaws characterizing mainstream economics."
</p>

<p>
5
</p>

<p>
"The point we want to emphasize here is what the textbook format conveys to a student: there is a fundamental analytical framework, or way of thinking like an economist, this can be applied successively to different subjects or issue areas. <b>The world may change but economics is comprehensive.</b> And not only this, it is a consistent, coherent and unified body of applied knowledge, providing the social science equivalent of an engineering manual. Economic theory may involve some policy disagreement, but this is mainly restricted to values, built into different choices or assumptions in the "normative" part of economics. Mainstream Economics is overwhelmingly presented to the student as a "positive" science through its quantifications."
</p>

<p>
"Moreover, as anyone who has been taught mainstream economics will also realize, there is a subtle socialization of perspective built into both the deductive method used for theory demonstration and the specific assumptions and axioms that tend to dominate. <b>Students are invited to think that people are (and so it is natural and morally appropriate to be) individualistic, self-interested, calculative instrumental optimizers. This will later influence how economists view the natural world (as objectified instrumentally positioned exploitable resources)."</b>
</p>

<p>
6
</p>

<p>
"It is in the context of the associations set out, that the general point we began with has its greatest <br>
force. We began by noting that mainstream economics does not take as its point of departure the materiality of an economy and its embedded consequences. So, if students are told that there is a unified analytical framework and toolkit, and that they are being taught how to think like economists, and that this is successively applicable to<br>
all aspects of an economy and possibly to all aspects of <br>
society, <b>then the overwhelming effect is to suggest</b><br>
<b>nothing is missing and all possible questions or doubts will be subsequently answered as and when the analytical framework is applied to those problems – whatever they are.</b> In broader social science contexts, this type of idea would be called a <b>‘totalizing concept’</b>. For example, ‘Globalization’ was presented as such a totalizing concept early in its intellectual ‘career’; and moreover as a received theory based on some type of presumed social scientific ‘consensus’, which however did not exist (see Amoore et al., 1997). In any case, the mainstream economics textbook combination of associations has socializing effects that work like misdirection in a magic trick: the glaring omission of materiality is masked. Hence, mainstream economics is an impediment (to alternatives) through its socializing effects."
