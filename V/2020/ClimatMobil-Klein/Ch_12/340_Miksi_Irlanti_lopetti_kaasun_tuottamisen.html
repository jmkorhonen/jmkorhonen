Angela Carter is a professor of political science who is studying jurisdictions that are instituting “keep it in the ground” policies and laws, seeking to understand the political conditions that have resulted in some political leaders turning away from the powerful oil and gas industry and consciously choosing to leave known reserves of fossil fuels where nature buried them away millions of years ago. Now a professor at University of Waterloo, Carter hails originally from Newfoundland, where her childhood experience of seeing the economic and social costs of the collapse of the cod fishery sparked her interest in how societies can escape the boom-and-bust roller coaster ride of economic dependence on a single resource sector. Carter’s home province hasn’t been giving her much hope these days, given the new climate denialism that prevails there. So Carter has shifted her gaze elsewhere, looking for inspiration, and has found it in the places where, in fits and starts, “keep it in the ground” policies are taking hold. 
</p>

<p>
Take, for example, the case of Ireland. 
</p>

<p>
Despite its known and potential fossil fuel reserves, Ireland is turning away from extracting them. In 2017, the Irish Parliament passed an anti-fracking bill. The next year, it passed a fossil fuel divestment bill, the first national government to do so.12 Also that year, the legislature began debating a Climate Emergency Measures Bill — a one-page piece of legislation that is “beautiful in its simplicity,” according to Carter — which states that, so long as global carbon in the atmosphere remains above 350 parts per million, Ireland will ban new offshore oil and gas drilling, effectively closing the door on the development of major new oil or gas projects. Irish Taoiseach (the term used for prime minister) Leo Varadkar and his Fine Gael party initially attempted to block the bill’s advancement, but then, under pressure from rising mobilization for climate action, in late September 2019, Varadkar announced at the UN Climate Summit that his government would be ending offshore oil exploration. Each new act — from anti-fracking to divestment, and now a “keep it in the ground” bill — builds upon the last. “These things are scaffolded on each other,” describes Carter. 
</p>

<p>
In 2016, the Irish government struck a citizens’ assembly tasked with exploring a number of contentious issues, including what policies the country should adopt to drive down GHG emissions and make Ireland a climate leader. In 2019, the citizens’ assembly issued its climate report with 13 strong policy recommendations.13 The assembly’s willingness to make such recommendations may give political cover to the politicians as they consider their next moves. 
</p>

<p>
There is a small oil and gas industry in Ireland — the Corrib offshore gas field will be producing for another 10 to 15 years — and the industry did indeed attempt to defend offshore drilling and block passage of the Climate Emergency Measures Bill. “Oil industry lobbying of parliamentarians increased seven-fold” in reaction to the bill, notes Carter. But the industry is not powerful (as it is in Canada). Ireland’s minority coalition government was another piece of the equation, giving the left parties and Green Party more influence. But conservative pro-business parties still dominate Ireland’s legislature. The key, in Carter’s view, was pressure from below, from local residents and social movements. 
</p>

<p>
The first notable law to pass, the anti-fracking bill, “originated from pressure by local communities, which happened to be in more conservative ridings, that did not want to risk their water being contaminated by fracking. They were concerned about property values and quality of life, really local issues,” recounts Carter. “There were some very politically savvy local people who had close political connections to the leading Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil conservative parties, which are by no means tree-hugger parties. So local citizens were able to effectively press their politicians to make sure fracking never happened in their region, and they scaled that up to a ban on fracking across the country.”
</p>

<p>
...
</p>

<p>
After they scored this win, recounts Carter, “some of the activists and organizers set their sights higher.” The momentum from this political win went into the push for the divestment bill, and later the Climate Emergency Measures Bill banning offshore development. This evolution of wins is similar to what has happened in Quebec. 
</p>

<p>
The role of students and youth has been fundamental. The divestment act grew out of student-led divestment campaigns at the university level. And in the more recent debates over the bill, the politicians, according to Carter, “really feel the pressure of the students, the school children at the gates of the legislature. They are really hearing that call. In fact, one of the Fianna Fáil [one of Ireland’s dominant conservative parties] members I spoke to in Dublin said his daughter is one of the school strikers. Mobilization for bold action to confront the climate crisis is now at the breakfast tables of political leaders who would otherwise ignore it.” Again, this echoes Vancouver’s recent experience with its climate emergency motions.
</p>

<p>
...
</p>

<p>
This widespread social mobilization has forced Irish politicians to act. Carter said that, “while the industry lobbying has certainly intensified, at the same time there has been an intensification of the Extinction Rebellion and climate strike movements, which has caught the attention of parliamentarians. Irish people generally have not been ones to protest in the streets, but suddenly school children and grandmas are coming out in weekly strikes all across the country. Politicians now realize they need to demonstrate real climate leadership.” 
</p>

<p>
Also key to the climate movement’s success in Ireland has been the role of Catholic faith leaders, and specifically Trócaire, “a Catholic organization that is well-regarded in Ireland. They do missionary work globally and they have made a commitment to acting on the climate crisis. In the countries in which they work in Africa, they see first-hand the impact of drought caused by climate change. They’ve connected those issues to Ireland’s role in the crisis, and are now pressing for change at home. This is the organization that has been behind the scenes, and sometimes very much in front, bringing together coalitions to get these bills passed,” said Carter.
