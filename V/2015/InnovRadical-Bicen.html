</ul>
</li>

</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li>start-ups are generally resource-constrained anyway, and the ones that compete in turbulent markets are even more resource-limited because market demand, competition and technology change rapidly and discontinuously (Eisenhardt, 1989; Shane, 2000; Katila and Shane, 2005)</li>
<li>despite topicality of resource limitation in boundary-less activities of firms, there has been limited research explaining the nature of resource-limited innovation
<ul>
<li>Katila &amp; Shane 2005, Weiss et al. 2011</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>that is termed "emerging literature"</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
The lack of systematic investigation on resource-limited innovation led us to an inductive study. 
</p>

<p>
<b>RQ: Given that the failure rate of radical innovation practices is very high in turbulent markets (Ghosh and Nanda, 2014), why do some new firms, despite whatever resource constraints they might face, have positive radical innovation outcomes, and not others? Why don't we see more companies like Udacity?</b>
</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li>findings show that <b>context matters in prioritizing resources</b> </li>
<li>"positive outlooking" firms seem to have a distinct capability to perceive resource limitations as innovation drivers</li>
<li>companies that have "lean innovation capability" use <span class="zim-tag">@design_thinking</span> as their main methodology</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Though design thinking has been heavily discussed in the business arena as a panacea for the economy, the academic literature has thus far been silent on the role of this emerging topic (e.g. Johansson-SkÃ¶ldberg et al. 2013; Seidel and Fixson, 2013; Liedtka, 2014)
</p>

<p>
<b>Contributions:</b><br>
<ul>
<li>contributes to organizational theory on resource allocation, where the debate is on how resource limitation can propel innovation outcomes</li>
<li>explores the conditions and contingency factors that may explain successful resource-limited radical innovation practices
<ul>
<li>contributes conceptually by presenting a conceptual model of resource-limited innovation</li>
<li>empirically, this study is one of the first attempts to understand resource-limited radical innovation practices in high-turbulent environments</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>contributes to capabilities literature, and also design thinking literature, where theoretical advancement is still in its infancy</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
280
</p>

<p>
To our knowledge, this is one of the first empirical studies where the role of design thinking as a methodology is examined and discussed in the context of radical innovation in high-turbulent markets. 
</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li>also contributes to entrepreneurial bricolage literature</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>Background</h2>

<br>

<p>
Schumpeter (1934) made his seminal argument that innovation is the stronghold of larger firms as only they can muster the resources required. Since then, many scholars have consistently argued that due to its obscure nature radical innovation requires an excess amount of resources, often called <span class="zim-tag">@slack</span> , needed to experiment with new ideas and strategies; otherwise, lack of resources will starve out radical innovation activities (e.g. March and Simon, 1958; Cyert and March, 1963; Amabile, 1997; Nohria and Gulati, 1997; Bradley et al., 2011).
</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li>Example: O'Brien (2003) argued that slack financial resources can facilitate investments in radical product innovations and protect organizations from potential depletion of resources, if such efforts fail.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Contrary to this "slack is good" argument, there have been studies showing that high slack leads to risk aversion and may breed complacency, which results in low exploration and increased motivation to focus on known strengths through exploitation (Penrose, 1959; Levinthal and March, 1993). It briefly notes that slack hampers the process of radical innovation (Voss et al., 2008; Ohly and Fritz, 2010; Troilo et al., 2013) and entrepreneurial success may be derived from "the pursuit of opportunity without regard to resources currently controlled" (Stevenson et al,. 1999:5). For example, George (2005) showed that many new firms performed better when resource demands exceeded resource availability by making the sparest allotment of resources work to one's advantage. Similarly, Sarasvathy's (2001) concept of effectuation highlights that new ventures adopt the logic of effectual reasoning where they start very small with the means that are closest at hand and move almost directly into action without elaborate planning. 
</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li>entrepreneurial <span class="zim-tag">@bricolage</span> theory explains and predicts why some new firms - that lack resource endowments for innovation - nevertheless manage to innovate
<ul>
<li>Baker et al. 2003; Baker and Nelson, 2005</li>
<li>first introduced by Levi-Strauss (1967)</li>
<li>Baker and Nelson (2005:334-6) showed that the presence of three simultaneous elements characterized bricolage:
<ul>
<li>making do: a "bias toward action and active engagement with problems and opportunities rather than lingering over questions of whether a workable outcome can be created from what is at hand"
<ul>
<li>considered fundamental to the process by which bricolage creates something within the constrained resources context</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>rather than acquiring resources in response to well-defined demands of the projects, firms with bricolage behavior possess a set of skills that may always be useful</li>
<li>"combination and re-use of resources for different applications than those for which they were originally intended"</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
281
</p>

<p>
Novel combinations of resources may serve as a mechanism driving the discovery of innovation in the form of new services (Schumpeter, 1934; Penrose, 1959), what Levi-Strauss (1967:17) called "brilliant unforeseen results."
</p>

<p>
When faced with resource constraints, Baker and Nelson (2005) note, firms have three alternatives: 
</p>

<p>
<ol type="1" start="1">
<li>They may seek to acquire types of resources that new challenges demand</li>
<li>they may avoid new challenges and take the paths of downsizing or disbanding</li>
<li>they may engage in bricolage by rendering novel services that arise from their ability and willingness to refuse to enact common limitations</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
Rather than worrying about whether they have the right tools, they are willing to experiment and try to find ways to accomplish goals (Baker et al. 2003; Garud and Karnoe 2003)
</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li>Penrose (1959) states in her seminal discussion on the nature of firms, that <b>different firms will discover and elicit different services and combinations of services from similar resource constraints</b></li>
<li>firms vary greatly in their "bricolage capabilities" (Baker and Nelson 2005:357), ie their ability to extract services from the resources available to them</li>
<li>this helps explain why only few firms choose bricolage when they face limited resources, and are successful at managing that process</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Caldwell and O'Reilly (2003) argue for the importance and timeliness of the discussion on resource-limited radical innovation</b> </li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
282
</p>

<p>
283
</p>

<h2>Context Matters</h2>

<br>

<p>
Prior research on a resource-based view has suggested that firm resources do not exist in isolation, but their value is influenced by the context in which the firms compete (e.g. Pfeffer and Salancik, 1978; Barney, 1991; Priem and Butler, 2001). Consistent with this view, open systems models also provide explanations on how contextual variations shape how firms perceive resources (e.g. Boulding, 1956; Scott, 1998; Pfeffer, 2003). These perspectives imply that the context in whcih a resource is applied will influence whether or not the resource is valuable for the firm's innovation efforts (e.g. Burt, 1992).

<h2>Lean Innovation Capability</h2>

<br>

<p>
<ul>
<li><span class="zim-tag">@bricolage</span> concept helps understand resource-limited innovation</li>
<li>bricolage research focuses on the organizational behaviours and processes that may allow resource-limited firms to exploit their potential for agility by making creative use of their limited resources (e.g. Senyard et al. 2014)</li>
<li>what leads to bricolage?</li>
<li>data here reveals three insights:
<ul>
<li>successful firms follow a non-traditional logic when they approach complex problems</li>
<li>they use the validity-driven approach</li>
<li>and focus on the overlapping spaces of three criteria:
<ul>
<li>latent needs</li>
<li>technological trends</li>
<li>business needs</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>in order to decide exactly what constraints they have and how to work with them.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Martin (2009) the logic of what could be, or <b>abductive reasoning</b> 
<ul>
<li>abductive reasoning <b>not</b> obsessed about finding what is right, like <b>declarative</b> reasoning</li>
<li>instead, it is mostly about what <b>could</b> or <b>might</b> be right</li>
<li>through <span class="zim-tag">@abductive</span> reasoning, the acquisition of knowledge is not an abstract exercise as it is with declarative reasoning, but it involves interaction with the context (Peirce, 1985)</li>
<li>in inductive reasoning, the aim is to prove through observation that something actually works</li>
<li>with deductive reasoning, one aims to prove through reasoning from principles that something must work</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
287
</p>

<p>
295
</p>

<p>
Our respondents preferred to work in resource-constrainted environments. As one of the founders in our sample said, "without constraints, breakthrough innovation does not<br>
296<br>
happen, and the best innovative offerings are often carried out within quite severe constraints."
</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li>consistent with the literature on creativity (e.g. Amabile, 1997)</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
<b>Definition of resources</b> from Hunt (2000): resources are tangible and intangible entities available to firms that enable them to produce market offerings that have value for some market segment(s). Hunt (2000) categorizes resources as financial (cash reserves and access to financial markets), physical (plant, raw materials and equipment), legal (trademarks and licensees), human (e.g. the skills and knowledge of individual employees, including their entrepreneurial skills), relational (e.g. relationships between competitors, suppliers, and customers), organizational (e.g. controls, routines, cultures, competences - including, importantly, a competence for entrepreneurship), and informational (e.g. knowledge about market segments, competitors and technology)
