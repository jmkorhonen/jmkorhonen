<li>introduces the topic of constraints and creativity</li>
<li>reports a preliminary study</li>
<li>sets a stage for the contributions in this special issue by identifying four central themes for further research</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li>creativity defined as "the generation of ideas that are both novel and useful" (Sternberg and Lubart 1999)</li>
<li>studies that argue constraints can hamper employee creativity:
<ul>
<li>Shalley, Zhou and Oldham 2004</li>
<li>Amabile et al. 2006</li>
<li>Zhou and Shalley 2008</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>studies that suggests constraints, particularly design constraints, often stimulate creativity rather than suppress it:
<ul>
<li>Costello &amp; Keane 200</li>
<li>Stokes 2001</li>
<li>Rietzschel et al. 2014</li>
<li>Rietzschel et al. 2014</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Constraints could stimulate creativity because they energize employee efforts, or because they reduce the complexity of a problem or task. <b>All in all, however, findings are mixed and inconclusive. </b>
</p>

<p>
185
</p>

<p>
The question is when these positive and negative effects occur.
</p>

<h1>Studies on Constraints to Creativity</h1>

<br>

<p>
<ul>
<li>key findings of studies addressing factors that influence employee creativity and contextual factors are that constraining and controlling work conditions is predominantly negatively associated with creativity</li>
<li>organizational constraints may take on various forms, including bureaucracy, and limiting the availability of resources such as money and time (Hlavacek and Thompson 1973; Amabile and Gryskiewicz, 1989)</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Overall, studies demonstrating the negative impact of organizational constraints largely focus (either explicitly or implicitly) on the role of autonomy, and the degree to which constraints thwart need fulfilment (Shalley, Zhou and Oldham, 2004). Thus, <b>the negative consequences of constraints are usually largely motivational: external constraints violate people's need for autonomy, which in turn diminishes intrinsic motivation, with inhibited creativity as a result. </b>
</p>

<p>
However, there is more to constraints than diminishing autonomy. For one thing, constraints can make a problem or task more manageable, and possibly even more interesting. When people are given free rein to solve a problem, they tend to be uncreative, and adopt existing methods that have worked in the past. 
</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li>reference to Ward's "path of least resistance": people tend to generate those ideas that are easiest to generate</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
A total lack of constraints might exacerbate this tendency, as it makes the task more complex and poses more information-processing demands (Simon, 1955; Branscombe and Cohen, 1991).
</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li>lack of constraints may also signal an absence of clear goals, leading to lowered effort and lower performance (Hirst et al. 2009)</li>
<li>when people are confronted with <b>certain kinds of constraints</b> they tend to come up with ingenious solutions (Finke 1990, Stokes 2001, Rietszcehl, Nijstad and Stroebe, 2014)</li>
<li>in these situations constraints seen as providing a challenge, and may reduce task complexity</li>
<li>may also entice employees to find a creative new way of circumventing obstacles and dealing with organizational impediments</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
<b>Design constraints take the form of boundaries that are set to a certain task or goal</b> (Stokes, 2001; Stokes and Harrison 2002), i.e. they determine how something can be done. 
</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li>innovation research and studies into organizational creativity tend to suggest constraints mainly harmful for creativity, while psychological research on creativity suggests they can be supportive as well</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Interactionist studies propose that organizational constraints and design constraints interact (Oldham and Cummings 1996; Burroughs and Mick, 2004; Baer and Oldham, 2006). An organizational constraints, for example a restricted budget, may have consequences for the design as certain features may get out of reach. On the other hand, shoestring budgets may be perceived as challenging and fuel creativity. This reasoning resonates also in several contributions in the field of organization studies. For example, Brown and Eisenhardt (1997) show that a limited structure is needed as well as freedom to improvise in order to achieve successful product innovation. <br>
<ul>
<li>Tatikonda and Rosenthal (2000) also show that for a successful innovation process a balance is needed between firmness (rules and regulations) and flexibility (autonomy and adequate resources)</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
186
</p>

<p>
... "constraints" is a complex and multifaceted construct: some constraints will exert different effects from others because they are fundamentally different in a relevant way - the difference between constraints that thwart need fulfilment and constraints that do not is a case in point<br>
<ul>
<li>creativity, too, is a multifaceted complex of behaviors and processes, not some monolithic construct</li>
</ul>
</p>

<br>

<p>
<ul>
<li>the authors distinguish between creative potential and practiced creativity, following DiLiello and Houghton (2006, 2008) and Binnewies et al (2007)
<ul>
<li><b>creative potential</b> is closely linked to self-efficacy, defined as "the belief [that] one has the ability to produce creative outcomes" (Tierney and Farmer 2002:1138)
<ul>
<li>i.e. whether employees think that they can be creative</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>practiced creativity</b> is defined as "the perceived opportunity to utilize creativity skills and abilities on the job (DiLiello and Houghton 2008:39)
<ul>
<li>differs from <b>output</b>, which is a performance measure</li>
<li>reflects the extent to which employees perceive themselves to be able to actually exploit their creative potential at work</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</p>

<br>

<p>
<ul>
<li>authors hypothesize, in line with innovation management and organizational creativity studies, that practised creativity is negatively related to constraints</li>
<li>constraining and controlling work conditions inhibit employees' exploiting their creativity</li>
<li>perhaps these should be called "impediments"?</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
187
</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li>hypothesis 2: the negative relationship between perceived constraining organizational factors and perceived practiced creativity is moderated by perceived supportive organizational factors in such a way that this negative relationship is weakened in the presence of supportive organizational factors</li>
<li>hypothesis 3: the degree to which employees perceive constraining organizational factors is positively related to employees' creative potential</li>
<li>hypothesis 4: the positive relationship between perceived constraining organizational factors and perceived potential creativity is mdoerated by perceived supportive organizational factors in such a way that this positive relationship is enhanced in the absence of supportive organizational factors (resources)
<ul>
<li><b>in essence, argues that although constraints may make employees FEEL more creative, constraints may prevent them from actually USING their creativity</b></li>
<li>a lack of organizational resources will even enhance the feeling of having creative abilities, whereas the presence of organizational resources enhances the feeling of being able to actually exploit creative potential at work
<ul>
<li>due to "big fish in small pond" or "frog-pond" effect</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2>Research Themes</h2>

<br>

<p>
<ul>
<li>recognized several general challenges and avenues for further research that broaden the study of the role of constraints for organizational creativity</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>Impact of Specific Constraints on Individual Creative Behavior</h3>

<br>

<p>
<ul>
<li>need to refine our understanding of what are constraints and how they affect creative behavior</li>
<li>behavioral psychologists suggest that constraints tend to generate variability in the way that people approach a problem and try to find a solution (Stokes, 2001; Stokes and Harrison, 2002)</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Creative imagination seems to work best when one is confronted with explicitly understood constraints (Kamoche and Pina e Cunha, 2001; Kelly and Leggo, 2008)<br>
<ul>
<li>studies in this line predominantly based on case studies in creative industries (e.g. Beautty and Ball, 2010a, 2010b) or on small-scale experiments in a laboratory setting (Moreau and Dahl, 2005; Sellier and Dahl, 2011)</li>
<li>refer mainly to mental constraints, i.e. artificial constraints adopted as scaffolding to generate creativity (McDonnell, 2011)
<ul>
<li>the workplace might pose constraints of a different nature</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Does the specific nature of constraints impact their effect on creativity?</b></li>
<li><b>Do we need to distinguish between different types of constraints?</b></li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
192
</p>

<h3>The Nature of the Creative Process</h3>

<br>

<p>
<ul>
<li>we need to further explore the nature of the creative process itself</li>
<li>existing studies typically regard creativity as an output variable, and do not take into account that creativity encompasses a <b>process</b> from initial idea to creative outcome</li>
<li>little known how and whether constraints differentially impact the various stages of the creative process</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>Nature of the Task at Hand</h3>

<br>

<p>
<b>A third challenge concerns the question how the relation between constraints and creativity might also depend on the nature of the tasks an employee has to perform.</b>
</p>

<p>
<span class="zim-tag">@HOXNOTE</span> even this, however, does not look at <b>technology</b>, only task!!
</p>

<p>
...
</p>

<p>
It may be the case, for example, that tasks involving incremental improvements ask for fewer (or other) constraints than tasks of a more radical nature. 
</p>

<p>
193
</p>

<h3>Organizational Factors that Constrain or Facilitate Creativity</h3>

<br>

<p>
A fourth challenge for future research concerns the relation between constraints and resources... As yet, it is not clear whether and how the impact of various facilitating factors differs from the impact of their negative twin, i.e. the constraining factors that indicate tha basence of certain facilitating factors
</p>

<br>

<p>
...
</p>

<p>
If there is one thing that the contributions to this special issue (and our own empirical work) show, it is that the relation between constraints and creativity is complex, fascinating, and as yet, understudied.
