<ul>
<li>experimental paper, but using actual industrial designers and tools they were familiar with</li>
<li>finds new generation CAD tools help avoid trade-offs between creativity (generativeness) and constraints (robustness of design) - in "design gap" phase where sketches are translated to drawings the first time</li>
</ul>

<p>
"What is not constrained is not creative" (Johnson-Laird, 1988)
</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li>Are designers doomed to sacrifice creativity when integrating <span class="zim-tag">@NPD</span> processes?</li>
<li>creativity often restricted to "fuzzy front end" of <span class="zim-tag">@Design</span> process</li>
<li>but constraints can also be a resource for creativity; this has been previously shown with artists and engineers</li>
<li><b>RQ: In which cases can a constraint be a resource for creativity?</b>
<ul>
<li>investigates different types of CAD software</li>
<li>compares the performance of those types of software at the so-called design gap where design sketches are transformed into digital models</li>
<li>shows that some CAD software enables designers to work under additional constraints, be more creative and avoid the trade-off between robustness and creativity</li>
<li>understanding this performance means appreciating that such software enables designers to play with the embedded constraints to reveal associated fixations and to design models that follow the constraint but overcome the fixation</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>constraints and creativity are linked by two competing processes:
<ul>
<li>constraints decrease the degree of freedom, and as a result, cognitive possibilities</li>
<li>but embedding constraints increases the awareness of fixations and therefore the capacity to design original models</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>today, new CAD tools more effectively support the second process, which leads to "acquired originality" in design.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
It is well known that creativity involves not only originality but also feasibility, i.e. not only "good ideas" but also feasible ones. 
</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li>some researchers believe creativity must be fostered at the beginning of the design process
<ul>
<li>this approach first popularized in automobile design</li>
<li>the roots of "fuzzy front end" approach</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</p>

<br>
<br>

<p>
Following the hypothesis that conforming<br>
248<br>
a design to industrial constraints impedes creativity, the fuzzy front end approach advocates increasing the creative potential before addressing constraints. In this scheme, the best guarantee for high levels of creativity appears to be maximum freedom at the beginning of the design process (Karniel and Reich, 2011). The NPD process then consumes this initial creativity potential.
</p>

<p>
<b>Under this approach, there is a tension between creativity (which is considered as a number of degrees of freedom) and constraints (which reduce the degrees of freedom and should be introduced later in the process). Thus, there is a trend in the creativity and innovation management literature to posit an opposition between creativity and constraint, i.e., between originality and robustness.</b><br>
\cite{Arrighi2015} write that a certain and fairly influential school of thought in NPD research asserts that creativity must be fostered at the beginning of the design process. This approach, known as "fuzzy front end," (Khurana and Rosenthal, 1998; Reid and de Brentani, 2004) was first popularized through experiences in automobile design (Fujimoto, 1997; Thomke and Fujimoto, 2000). It starts from a hypothesis that conforming a design to industrial constraints impedes creativity, and therefore creative potential needs to be unleashed before addressing the constraints. Thus, maximum freedom from constraints is advocated for the beginning of the design process (Karniel and Reich, 2011). The fuzzy front end approach has built-in tension between creativity (defined as degrees of freedom) and constraints (which reduce the degrees of freedom). Constraints should be introduced only later in the process. 
</p>

<p>
NOTE: there are probably good reasons why this approach is favored in automobile industry. It does not follow, however, that it would be a very good approach elsewhere. 
</p>

<p>
However, as \cite{Arrighi2015} note, there is also a different community that envisions design process as a succession of iterative steps that *all* require the creative capacity to challenge previous choises and to continously "reframe the problem" with creativity. SchÃ¶n (1983, 1990) was one of the first to consider design to be more than a problem-solving activity in that managing constraints during the design process should be coupled with creativity and originality.
</p>

<p>
<b>Constraints can trigger innovation and lead to original and creative design.</b> This concept is understood by artists (writers, poets, painters, etc.) who use constraints to increase their creativity, such as the French literary movement known as "Oulipo" ("Ouvroir de litterature potentielle", which is roughly translated as the "workshop of potential literature"), in which creativity is stimulated by writing constraints (e.g., using particular words, avoiding certain letters, etc.) <b>This concept might also apply to engineering design (Burkhardt and Lubart, 2010; Sternberg and Lubart, 1999; Le Masson et al., 2011, Goldenberg and Mazursky, 2000).</b> It has been shown that recent design theories tend to support the dual improvement in robustness and generativeness, which leads to interweaving these terms in design processes. (Le Masson et al., 2011)
</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Research gap</b>: in creativity and innovation literature: are these two types of performances - generativeness and robustness - necessarily evolving in opposite directions during NPD; or is it possible for them to grow simultaneously during NPD?</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
...
</p>

<h2>Motivations, Theoretical Background and Hypothesis</h2>

<br>

<p>
Many studies have shown that creativity and originality are important to triggering, fostering and sustaining innovation (Olson et al,. 1998; Verganti, 2008). However, creativity and innovation capacities are difficult to integrate into industrial environments.

<h3>A Divided Literature Regarding Management of Creativity and Industrial Constraints</h3>

<br>

<p>
<ul>
<li>roots of fuzzy front end approach: Karniel and Reich 2011, based on the work of Ullman (1997)</li>
<li>degree of freedom is consumed like capital as the design process progresses</li>
<li>phase of maximum creativity at the beginning of the design process
<ul>
<li>should be free from constraints to enable consideration of the widest range of solutions possible (Reid and de Brentani 2004; see also Amabile, 1998)</li>
<li>intention is to promote the ultimate convergence towards a successful design because all the unpredicted future issues can be anticipated by preserving the maximum degree of initial freedom.
<ul>
<li><span class="zim-tag">@HOXNOTE</span> can they be anticipated???</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Other scholars consider the design process as a succession of iterative steps, in which each step requires the capacity to challenge previous choices and to continuously and creatively "reframe the problem"
<ul>
<li>van de Ven's "Innovation Journey" (van de Ven et al., 1999)
<ul>
<li>intensive and radical innovation achieved by means of succession of iterative (and sometimes creative) steps</li>
<li>that is, <b>creativity not always accomplished at the beginning of the innovation journey</b></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Donald SchÃ¶n (1983, 1990) considered design to be more than a problem-solving activity
<ul>
<li>considers the design issue to consist of "framing" and reframing a problem</li>
<li>creative framing is constructed from the materials of problem situations</li>
<li>SchÃ¶n also posits that each move is a local experiment that contributes to a global experiment in reframing the problem</li>
<li>here, managing constraints during the process is coupled with creativity and originality</li>
<li>this approach widespread in many research communities; recommends including creative phases throughout the design process (Couger, 1990; Dorst and Cross, 2001). </li>
<li>Bujis (2003) uses the expression "circular chaos" rather than "linear logic" to refer to the design process</li>
<li>some authors stress that a shift in a creative concept can occur even late in the design process (Seidel, 2007)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>Deciphering from a Design Theories Perspective</h3>

<br>

<p>
<b>... On the one hand, the tension between creativity and constraint arises out of an analysis of the development process as a problem-solving issue.</b> In a problem-solving framework, constraints indicate less freedom and creativity and are directly linked to the degrees of freedom, which means that there is an inherent conflict between creativity and constraints.
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, it has long been shown that problem solving takes a view of design process that is too limited (Hatchuel, 2002; Rittel, 1972; SchÃ¶n, 1990). 
</p>

<p>
250
</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li>from the broader perspective of design theory, a design process can consist of "reframing the problem" or, more generally, of generating original products and services that embody newly invented performance criteria.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
<b>This concept describes the logic of originality in creative design: the outcome is not a "solution" to a problem but is original precisely because it cannot be deduced from a given set of rules (Boden, 1990).</b> Contemporary design theories compete to model a growing number of generative processes, i.e., outside-the-box processes that extend beyond problem solving. 
</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li>the question is, when can constraints simultaneously lead to more generativeness (design proposals that differ from existing solutions and design standards) and robustness (the ability to produce designs that meet constraints, such as functional requirements)</li>
</ul>
