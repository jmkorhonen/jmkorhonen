<p>
The unit of analysis is taken “technology as artefact”. A product is modelled as a complex artificial system that contains various elements that function collevctively according to the system’s architecture. Product innovation can then be understood as the introduction of one or more new elements in a system leading ot a new set of performance characteristics. When the new product is judged successful in the eys of users, the product is selected possibly at the expense of existing varieties. Industry development can then be understood as an evolutionary competition process between firms introducing new products and being selected on the basis of the quality of their products. 
</p>

<p>
…
</p>

<p>
The design task is to find combinations between elements that “fit” well when put together in a system. Due to dependencies among elements the system’s working cannot solely be understood from the behavior of its parts. For this reason, designers are not able to understand ex ante the working of a technology in all its possible designs (“bounded rationality”). Instead, they have to experiment from some working design and add small changes to this desig. This trial-and-error logic in problem-solving renders product development highly incremental and path-dependent. The complex systems perspective thus sheds new light on earlier evolutionary theories that hold that innovative activity is organised along technological trajectories that are part of technological paradigms (Dosi 1982).
</p>

</p>

<p>
Since competing firms will accept any cost-reducing innovation, changes in input prices are insufficient to explain bias in technological development into a particular direction. Put another way, changes in scarcity may motivate innovation, but a change in scarcity does not guarantee that the technical problems encountered in moving towards a particular input-saving direction, can be resolved (cf. Sahal 1981b:399). Though historical examples exist in which in a sudden scarcity of an input motivated innovations in directions that made technology less dependent on this input, the direction of technical change cannot be explained by changes in input prices alone (Rosenberg 1969).
</p>

<p>
For more discussion on induced innovation, see Coombs et al (1987).
</p>

<p>
21
</p>

<p>
The adoption of a technology cannot solely be explained by current relative input prices. A technology that is more expensive may still be adopted when the development potential is sufficiently higher compared to technologies that are currently less expensive in terms of input prices. Technology adoption cannot be solely explained by input prices, but requires in addition an analysis of firms’ expectations regarding the future development potential of different technological options. Only in the special case in which all technologies improve at the same rate, input prices alone can be considered sufficient to explain the adoption decisions of firms. 
</p>

<p>
22
</p>

<p>
Atkinson and Stiglitz (1969) derive an important normative proposition from their model of localized technological change. Public policy aiming at long-run growth could support technologies with high development potential in the long run, but which are neglected within the time-horizon over which private firms maximize profits. This reasoning provides an economic rationale for R&amp;D support in technologies, in poarticular science-based technologies. For these technologies, benefits are expected only after a very long period of time. 
</p>

<p>
(Firms can be expected to underinvest in science when results are difficult to appropriate (Arrow 1962b))
</p>

<p>
At any given moment in time, the set of relative input prices and the expected technological progress jointly determine the choice of a particular technology.<br>
The particular historical sequence of input prices, or more generally, the dynamics of the “selection environment” (Nelson and Winter 1982) plays a crucial role in explaining technological development. 
</p>

<p>
24
</p>

<p>
The concept of localized technological change and the possibility of irreversibility in technological development imply that innovation and factor substitution can only be considered as analytically distinct (Leydesdorff 1994). Technological development is primarily a cumulative process along particular paths of development that are expected to have a development potential. Scarcity of inputs as reflected in relative input prices plays only a minor role in the choice of technology and the direction in which it is advanced. Factual factor substitution generally takes place only after a new technology has been developed by radical innovation. 
</p>

<p>
… 
</p>

<p>
The localized nature of technological change can be considered a prime characteristic of evolutionary approches. 
</p>

<p>
25
</p>

<p>
In summary, under the assumption that technological development is localized, Atkinson and Stiglitz (1969) show that “history matters” in technological development. A fluctuation in relative input prices can lead firms to use a particular technology for a period of time, during which learning-by-doing and technological innovations are localised in this technology. This form of irreversibility in technology adoption renders the process of technological development an evolutionary process. 
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
The existence of network externalities may generate an incentive for individuals to stick to the old technology, even when the collective adoption of the new technology would lead to higher efficiency.
</p>

<p>
Bruckner et al (1994, 1996) developed a model of hyperselection, where one can derive the conditions for a successful introduction of a new technology in a market dominated by an older technology. (Alternative model of competition between an existing and a new technology has been proposed by Shy (1996). In this model, consumer have preferences both regarding the quality of a technology and the size of the network of users of a technology. In this set-up, the network size can be both a substitute for quality and a complement to quality from the perspective of users. )
</p>

<p>
N =number of production plants<br>
N1 = the number of plants using technology 1<br>
N2 = the number of plants using technology 2<br>
B1, B2 = efficiencies of technologies 1 &amp; 2
</p>

<p>
Consider the case that technology 1 is locked in (N1 = N) and technology 2 becomes available with a higher efficiency than technology 1 (B1 &lt; B2). A shift in lock-in from technology 1 to technology 2 is ony possible if the industry is “infected” with a sufficient number of production plants using technology 2, such that d/dt (N2) &gt; d/dt (N1). The size of infection can be derived from stationary point (iii):
</p>

<p>
N2 &gt; NB1 / (B1 + B2), 
</p>

<p>
which can be rewritten as:
</p>

<p>
N2 &gt; N / [(B2 / B1) +1]
</p>

<p>
From this inequality condition, one can derive that the critical size of infection that is required for technological substitution depends on the total number of plants N and the selective advantage (B2 / B1) of technology 2 over technology 1. 
</p>

</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
The normative implication of this model holds that altenrative institutional arrangements other than the competitive market may overcome the market failure to subsittute the old technolgy for the new technology. Public investments in technolgies that are considered superior when explored collectively but inferior when explored individually can be legitimised on this basis (e.g. investmetns in electric car technology).
</p>

<p>
But! Picking the winners is a problem - so:
</p>

<p>
…
</p>

<p>
Instead of centralising selection at the central government level, an alternative government policy can be founded on programmes that stimulate collaborative R&amp;D-projects between firms in attempts to generate a critical mass f adopters of a new technology. 
</p>

<p>
…
</p>

<p>
- The model of Brucker et al. (1994, 1996) is a simplified model:
</p>

<p>
An important assumption underlying the model concerns the assumption of a homogenous selection environment. The two technologies compete on efficiency in producing a homogenous output, as they are perfect substitutes. More often, at the time of its introduction, a new technology only partially substitutes for services of the existing technolgoy as it offers some services at a higher quality level but others at a lower level (Saviotti 1996). When users are heterogeneous in their preferences, a new technology may survive in one niche of users that have a strong preference for services that are provided at a higher level by the new technolgoy, while the old technology survives in a niche of users that have a strong preference for services that are provided at a higher level by the old technolgy. <br>
- similar thing may happen with users with different budgets etc.
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
- Focusing devices: 
</p>

<p>
Hughes (1987) speaks of “reverse salients” that refer to components in a system that are in need of modification to optimise the overall performance of a system. <br>
…dependencies between components in complex systems generate internal “focusing devices” (Rosenberg 1969), which lead designers to focus innovative activity on particular elements at particular stages of development. 
</p>

<p>
39
</p>

<p>
As agrued by Klepper (1997) and Murmann and Tushman (1998), the product lifecycle is indeed not intended to cover the innovation dymamics of non-assembled products in which elements cannot be distinguished, such as chemicals and medicines. It should be clear that the product life-cycle model deals primarily with innovation in complex assembled products. the scaling of these products proceeds in successions of periods during which core elements do not change (e.g. gasoline engine). A dominant design can thus be considered as referring to a set of technical features of product designs that remains invariant over time.

<p>
The concept of “natural trajectory”:
</p>

<p>
Nelson and Winter (1977:56) describe natural trajectories as:
</p>

<p>
“heuristics that apply when a technology is advanced in a certain direction, and payoffs from advancing in that direction that exist under a wide range of demand conditions. We call these directions “natural trajectories”.<br>
…<br>
The concept of technological paradigm as introduced by Dosi (1982) also refers to a stable set of technological heuristics using a number of standardised technological elements. <br>
…<br>
Dosi (1982:152, n16) distinguishes between positive heuristics (“do’s”) from negative heuristics (“don’ts”)
</p>

<p>
43
</p>

<p>
Though the content of each research program is specific to each paradigm, Nelson and Winter (1977) argue that there exist at least two heuristics that guide innovative activity in the majority of technological paradigms. One heuristic is mechanisation and relates to process innovations that improve the cost efficiency of the production process. Another heuristic is scaling and relates to product innovations that improve the quality of products.<br>
…<br>
In my opinion, it is important to recognize that the concept of heuristic and paradigm do not relate to the technology itself. but to the way in which designers search for improvements of a technology.

Critique of neoclassical and evolutionary models
</p>

<p>
Critique 1: The first issue that has been largely ignored in analytical models, both in the neoclassical and in the evolutionary tradition, concerns the conceptualisation of technology as an assembled and complex system of interrelated elements. 
</p>

<p>
Critique 2: the second issue that is largely ignored in modelling is the use of heuristics by designers. In neoclassical theory, the assumption of perfect foresight regarding the pay-off of R&amp;D investment neglects the uncertainty inherent in innovation processes. However, the assumption of randomness in the majority of evolutionary models misses the point that, although inherently uncertain in its outcome, the innovatio process is guided by heuristics focusing R&amp;D to rather specific directions. Thus, although designers can not decide perfectly rationally in what directions to search, they are neither expected to search in a purely random manner. Their search behavior is thus best characterized as bounded rational (Simon 1955, 1969). The important research question then becomes what type of heuristics designers apply to search in an intelligent, non-random way without assuming that they are perfectly informed about the odds of success and failure of different options.<br>
…<br>
HOX HOX! Oma research question?
</p>

<p>
45
</p>

<p>
Critique 3: Finally the third issue that is largely ignored in modeling is product innovation. Instead, models have been concentrated on process innovation, which can partly be understood as a logical consequence of the input-output representation of technology (coombs et al. 1987). <br>
…<br>
1.3.2 Objective of the study<br>
…<br>
The model that will be developed in this study can be summarized by the following three features:<br>
<ol type="1" start="1">
<li>Technology is not considered as a “black box” and its functionality is not represented solely by cost efficiency. Instead, the unit of analysis … is technology as an artefact, both in form and function. … is defined technically as an assembled complex system of interrelated elements and functionally as a bundle of quality characteristics from which users select.</li>
<li>Technologically, the range of possible technologies is constrained only by the number of combinations between possible elements. Economically, the range of possible technologies is constrained by user preferences and production costs.</li>
<li>The combinatorial nature of innovation in assembled products poses a problem of complexity. The number of possible combinations increases exponentially with the number of elements in a product. Designers are expected to apply “heuristics” that concentrates search activity in particular parts of a complex technological system at particular stages of development.</li>

Using this model, I am able to address the three issues listed in the previous chapter that I consider underdeveloped in formal models: technological complexity, search heuristics, and product innovation.<br>

</p>

<p>
- a similar type of complexity as described here concerns the interdependent working of its constituting elements in complex technologies (Rosenberg 1969, Simon 1969)<br>
This similarity has provided the basis of transferring the NK-model from the biological realm to the economic realm (Kauffman 1988, 1993, 2000; Kauffman and Macready 1995; Frenken et al. 1997, 1999a, Camineti 1999; Auerswald et al. 2000; Kauffman et al. 2000; Valente 2000; Frenken 2001a)
</p>

<p>
…<br>
Though biological analogies have provided powerful heuristics in economic theorising on technological change, important differences exist between the evolution of organisms and the evolution of technological systems. The transfer of ideas and models from biology to economics should therefore be done carefully and reflexively. The differences<br>
52<br>
between the systems of reference should always be borne in mind (DeBresson 1987; Nelson 1995). The advantage of using the NK-model stems from its formal nature, which enables one to study both the similarities and differences between biological and technological evolution. <br>
One difference between biological and technological evolution concerns the possibility of imitation of designs among agents.<br>
…<br>
- it can be shown with tie NK model that imitation is expected to be less successful the more complex the technology that is imitated (Rivkin 2000)<br>
A second diffenrence … concerns the scope for mutation in biological and technological evolution. <br>
- new variations in organisms occur through random mutation in a single gene (“local search”)<br>
- new variations in technological designs can occur through random mutation in whatever number of elements, in principle in all of these (“global search”)<br>
…<br>
A third difference … the relationship between mutation and selection. <br>
- in biology, independent with regarding to prevailing selection conditions, occurs erratically and randomly<br>
- in economic life, the selection environment can initiate and direct innovation since producers can interact with users (e.g. Rosenberg 1969, Van den Belt and Rip 1987)

2.1 Kauffman’s NK-Model
</p>

<p>
Complex systems can be defined as systems containing elements that have manu interactions (Simon 1969 [1996]: 184-184). The evolutionary properties of complex systems have been subject of research in theoretical biology (Monod 1971; Kauffman 1989, 1993; Altenberg 1995, 1997; Wagner and Altenberg 1995). In biology, one distinguishes between the genotype and the phenotype of an organism. At the level of the genotype, mutations occur that lead to new variants in a population. At the level of the phenotype, which is the ensemble of traits that make up an organism’s fitness, natural selection operates in terms of differential rates of reproduction. Dependencies among genes imply a complex relation between an organism’s genotype and an organism’s phenotype. <br>
Complexity means here that a mutation in one gene may not only change the functional contribution of the mutated gene to the entire phenotype, but can also affect the functional contributions of interrelated genes to the phenotype. A gene does not simply translate into a particular trait, but operates in conjunction with other genes by regulating other genes’ state of activity. 
</p>

<p>
53
</p>

<p>
…<br>
Where biological organisms change through blind mutation… technologies change through search activity by designers. The design of technological artefacts can .. be analyzed as a choice problem between alternatives. From this perspective, the dependencies between elements imly that the choice of an element cannot be made independently from the choice of other elements due to interaction effects. 
</p>

<p>
Note 32: Hughes’ (1987:51) concept of technological system includes, apart from technical components, organisations, scientific texts, patents, and laws. However, Hughes (1987:55) acknowledges the usefulness of approaches that define systems solely in terms of the technical components embodied.

2.1.2 The description of a system as a string of alleles
</p>

<p>
Birchenhall (1995), Windrum and Birchenhall (1998) and Cooper (2000) developed related evolutionary models of complex technological systems based on genetic algorithms as developed by Holland (1975, 1992). The important difference between the NK-model and genetic algorithms is that the latter include, apart from mutation, crossover as a variety generating mechanism. This mechanism holds that designs are split in two parts, which are randomly matched with parts of other designs analogous to sexual reproduction in biological evolution. The analogy in technological evolution is that particular solutions in one design can be introduced in another design and vice versa. In the following, cross-over is not explicitly dealt but the possiblity of multi-element mutation, which is conceptually close to crossover, is considered.

The N-dimensional possibility space S is called the “design space” of a technology (Bradshaw 1992; Dennett 1995)<br>
…<br>
The combinatiorial nature of the design space of a system requires that elements are orthogonal to one another i.e. that elements can be treated as dimensions. Therefore, one element of a system cannot correspond with an allele of another element in the same system. For example, the description of alleles of the engine element as gasoline (“0”), electric (“1”), and steam (“2”) implies that the type of battery used in electric engines cannot count as another element<br>
56<br>
casu quo dimension in the description of the vehicle as a system. <br>
…<br>
Thus, a description of a combinatiorial space should therefore be such that only elements at the same level in the hierarchical decision tree are taken into account, where each element itself may again be described as a system in its own right (Callon 1987:30; Hughes 1987:55; Metcalfe 1995:36; Sébbar 1996a, 1996b; Potts 2000)
</p>

<p>
2.1.3 Epistatic relations between elements
</p>

<p>
Dependencies between the functioning of elements in a complex system are called “epistatic relations” (Kauffman 1993:41). An epistatic relation from one element to another element implies that when the allele of the one element changes, this change affects both the functioning of the one element itself and the functioning of the element that it epistatically affects. The ensemble of epistatic relations within a technological system is called a technology’s internal structure (Simon 1969; Saviotti 1986), or, as it will be called in the following, a technology’s architecture (Henderson and Clark 1990). <br>
…
</p>

<p>
57<br>
When epistatic relations exist between elements, the search for a good design becomes a dififcult task. The introduction of a new allele for one element may increase its functionality, but at the same time it may decrease the functionality of other elemetnts that it epistatically affects. Trade-offs between the functioning of elements in complex systems exist that make it hard to improve the functioning of one element without negative effects on the functioning of other elements (Alexander 1964; Rosenberg 1969). The more epistatic relations exist between elements, the more trade-offs are present in a system, and the more likely innovations in elements have negative by-effects on the workings of other elements. 
</p>

<p>
Note 38: To calclutate the number of possible architectures of a system, let Q stand for the number of possible architectures. For the matrix that represents the architecture (Figure 2-1), it holds that for all cells except those on the diagonal, an epistatic relation can be either present or absent. The total number of possible architectures Q for a system of N elements ins thus given by Q = 2^N(N-1) with Q increasing more than exponentially for linear increases in N.

<p>
…
</p>

<p>
Following Kauffman (1993), the functional properties of system [with minimum complexity] for each design is simulated by drawing randomly from a uniform distribution [0,1] a “fitness” value wn for each allele of an element sn. The fitness of the system as a whole W(s) is calculated as the mean value of the fitness avlues of the alleles of elements.<br>
…<br>
59
</p>

<p>
…<br>
Following Bradshaw and Lienert (1991) and Bradshaw (1992), one can call hill-climbing through trial-and-error “design space search” as search is represented as a path through design space. The terminology of design space search is meaningful when contrasted to “function space search.” This type of search is discussed in the Chapter 3. <br>
…
</p>

<p>
Note 39: Note that trial-and-error is close to, yet a simplified representation of Popper’s (1959, 1962) description of scientific development as series of conjectures (trials) and refutations (errors). As long as a new conjecture does not yield higher “fitness” (e.g. goodness of fit with empirical data), the existing conjecture will be maintained. Only when a new conjecture leads to a higher fitness, the previous one is abandoned for the newly found one (cf. Martin 1983).

…local trial-and error search on rugged landscapes can end up in several optima. Contrary to systems with no complexity (K=0), local trial-and-error in complex systems does no longer automatically lead to the optimal solution as one runs the risk of ending up in a local optimum instead of the global optimum. (In the context of technological evolution, this has been stressed, among others, by Alchian (1950:219) and Simon (1969 [1996]:46-47).)

<p>
Path-dependency in the NK model is different from path-dependency in models of increasing returns to adoption (Arthur 1989; David 1993; Dalle 1995, 1997; David et al. 1998). … The term path-dependency in the NK model refers to the path of an individual designer moving within a possibility space ending up in a local optimum. <br>
- these paths are deterministic, in a sense that fitness landscape remains fixed during the process of search<br>
- the local optimum found is solely dependent on the initial position of the designer and the sequence of mutations that follow<br>
In models of increasing returns, path-dependency refers to processes in which prevailing probabilities of transitions among distributions of a population of adopters are functions of the sequence of past transient distributions (David 2001). The dynamics of these models are macroscopic in the sense that the adoption decision of other agents influences the choice of the individual adopter. <br>
David (2001) noted that confusion is best avoided when reserving path-dependency for the latter type of collective processes. <br>
- the properties of the former type is closer to the idea of determinism sensitive to initial conditions (or by referring to “microscopic path-dependency”)

The fitness of an element changes randomly when it is mutated itself or when an element with which it is epistatically related is mutated. For example, consider the architecture of a sstem with K=1 in Figure 2-4-1. The architecture of epistatic relations implies that the fitness value of the first element changes when the first or second element is mutated, the fitness values of the second element changes when the first or second element is mutated, and the fitness value of the third element changes when the allele of the first or third element is mutated.

…<br>
At the population level of competing firms, selection takes place on two levels. Within the firm, a new variation is developed by means of mutation and this new design variation is accepted when found superior to the previous design or rejected when found inferior to the previous design. This internal variation-and-selection mechanism takes place within each firm until it reaches a local optimum. Then, the firm offers its locally optimal design on the market and competes for users. AT this population level of competing firms, designs are subject to market competition as a second selection mechanism. One can thus think of market competition at the level of the population of firms as a competition in a population of designs that are all locally optimal. 
</p>

<p>
67
</p>

<p>
To understand the main evolutionary dunamics at the population level that follow frim the NK-model, one can look at the variance in fitness values of local optima. The variance in fitness values of local optima differs for systems with different degrees of complexity. For systems with high complexity, local optima have similar fitness levels. In the context of biological evolution, a small variance in fitness values of locally optima implies that natural selection <br>
- operates slowly in eliminating less fit<br>
- in technological evolution, small variance implies that market competition between different technological solutions will operate slowly.<br>
- systems wit low complexity have a large variance in the fitness values of local optima<br>
- moreover, fewer local optima exist<br>
-&gt; thus, competition will then operate faster in eliminating suboptimals<br>
- Thus, the speed of evolution is inversely related to the complexity of a system’s architecture (Kauffman 1993:53-54)<br>
A second principle that can be derived from the properties of NK landscapes for population dynamics is that the outcome of hill-climbing on fitness landscapes with high complexity is very sensitive to the initial starting point. The higher the complexity of a system, the stronger path-dependency in search becomes. Therefore, different firms that hill-climb the fitness landscape of a very complex system are likely to find different local optima. By contrast, path-dependency in systems with low complexity is weak. The local optimum that firms find are less sensitive to the initial starting point, since fewer local optima exist and their basin of attraction is larger. Therefore, designs of technologies with low complexity will tend to have many alleles in common. Variety in designs will consequently be smaller. <br>
The two principles combined imply that the higher the complexity of a landscape, the larger the variety in locally optimal designs, and the more persistent this variety due to the low variance in fitness values of local optima.

For decomposable system it holds that the glbal optimum can be found using a more time-efficient strategy than the N-element mutation rule. A system is decomposable when a system can be partitioned in subsystems of elements for which holds that epistatic relations exist only between elements that are part of the same subsystem and not between elements that are part of different subsystem (simon 1969; Wagner and Altenberg 1995).

Apart from saving on the number of required trials, a second advantage of decomposition holds that separate teams can work independently on subsystems and thus in parallel (Marengo 1998; Frenken et al. 1999a; Kollman et al. 2000). This division-of-labor and decentralisation in search activity further economises search time. (Another advantage of decomposable teams concerns the reduction in the costs of communication channels (Arrow 1974))<br>
- the advantage of decomposition increases for larger systems; e.g. N=8 system, exhaustive search 2^8 = 256, or 2 x 2^4 = 32 iterations -&gt; reduces search time by 87.5 %
</p>

<p>
The K-value, which indicates the number of elements epistatically affecting each element, does not take into account to what extent a system can be decomposed in subsystems. Thus, the K-value is not a precise indicator of complexity in terms of the time needed to find the global optimum. K is a measure of a system’s “structural complexity” as it indicates the complexity in terms of the number of epistatic relations that make of a system’s internal structure. However, the K-value does not indicate the “computational complexity” of a system in terms of the required time to find the global optimum. Systems with the same K-value can have very different degrees of computtational complexity.

2.3.2 Cover size<br>

… “heuristics” … can be defined as ways to reduce the search space in order to economise on time and resources (Nelson and WInter 1977; Dosi 1982; Van Lente 1993; Metcalfe 1995). 
</p>

<p>
77<br>
…<br>
Importantly, every reduction by 1 in the cover size corresponds to a decrease by half of the time required to complete the search. The benefits in terms of the amount of time and resources that are saved thus increase exponentially for each such reduction by 1 in epsilon-cover size. For example, for epsilon=0 and K=2, cover size equals 10 which implies that 2^10 = 1024 trials are required… Relaxing the performance requirement to epsilon=0.20 for systems with K=2, epsilon-cover size only equals 7 which implies that only 128 trials are required to find a satisfactory solution. Search is thus eight times faster when a loss of fitness of at most 20 percent is tolerated. In a situation of competing firms, a firm that wants to offer the optimal design to its users requires 8 times as much time to bring a product to the market compared to a firm that offers a design with at most 20 percent less performance. Furthermore, assuming that each firm incurs a fixed cost per trial, the firm aiming to design the optimal design also requires a search budget that is 8 times larger compared to the other firms.

…what kind of local search strategies, or “heuristics”, are expected to be most successful in finding reasonably good solutions to complex design problems using little computational time and resources.<br>
For one set of complex systems, called nearly-decomposable systems, a very powerful heuristic can be followed. Nearly-decomposable systems are systems that are non-decomposable, but have a structure of epistatic relations such that the majority of these relations are located within subsystems (Simon 1969 [1996]:197-210; Nelson and Winter 1977:53; Dennett 1995[1996]:215)
</p>

<p>
81
</p>

<p>
The simulation exercise shows that nearly-decomposable systems are best searched by ignoring the rare epistatic relations between subsystems and by restricting search within subsystems. It thus explains that systems with a nearly-decomposable architecture of epistatic relations are expected to be very common, since for these systems it is relatively easy to find a well-working design. This conclusion has been drawn previously by various scholars in various contexts (Simon 1962, 1969, 1973; Dennett 1995; Schilling 2000). This result confirmed the early discussion of Simon (1969) on nearly-decomposable systems, in which he stated that nearly-decomposable systems have the advantage that these can be improved by changes within each subsystem without the need to coordinate in between subsystems.<br>

<p>
Chapter 3: A generalised model of product innovation in complex systems
</p>

<p>
The assumption of random mutation follows the majority of models in evolution economics (Nelson and Winter 1982; Andersen 1994; Auerswald et al. 2000; Kauffman et al. 2000). The argument holds that the outcome of investments in Research and Development are inherently uncertain, and can therefore best be modelled as a random move in a design space.<br>
…<br>
The possibility of directed instead of random mutation in human problem-solving constitutes an important difference between technological evolution and biological evolution. In biological evolution, genes have an equal propability to be mutated as mutations are considered “copying errors” in the reproduction proess of genes from parent to offspring. The state of the selection environment bears no influence on the propability of a gene to become subject of mutation. By contrast, human problem-solving in technological systems is generally motivated by improving particular functional attributes of the system. More precisely, before designers engage in search they generally have a mental model of the future user group. The mental model guides search into particular directions rather than in other directions. In modelling terms, the mental model restricts mutations to take place only in particular elements of a system, which are considered instrumental for improvements of particular kinds.

Chapter 5: Entropy statistics as a framework to analyse technological evolution
</p>

<p>
138<br>
The set of products present in an industry at some point in time is described by the N-dimensional frequency distribution of designs incorporated in the products offered in an industry. <br>
- Saviotto (1996) calls such sets of products "product population"
</p>

<p>
The main argument made in this chapter holds that entropy statistics applied to frequency distributions of product designs can well describe the evolution of a technology in terms of the changes in the degree and nature of product variety. As an indicator of variety the entropy of the distribution of designs can indicate the extent to which a population is characterised by a "dominant design".<br>
- the analysis of product populations as defined as sets of technological artefacts sharing the same design space differs from market analyses: the latter define product populations in terms of the degree of similarity of the services products provide.<br>
- the empirical analysis in this study deals with the technological evolution of different artefact designs that are all represented in the same design space whatever the differences between different artefacts designs in terms of the level of service characteristics they provide.
</p>

<p>
139
</p>

<p>
- maximum entropy corresponds to the case in which all designs occur at the same frequency<br>
- such a complete flat distribution occurs when designers would randomly move around in design space and randomly choose the alleles of elements<br>
- a skewed distribution occurs when few of the possible designs are dominating the product population<br>
- such a distribution has a low entropy value indicating that product variety is low; designers have not chosen a design at random, but have somehow learned what designs are to be preferred.
</p>

<p>
The entropy measure thus indicates the degree of variety of product designs in a product population.<br>
- Saviotti (1988b:91) proposed the use of entropy statistics to measure product variety using data of product characteristics. Frenken et al. (1999b, 20000) and Van Herpen and Pieters (2000) actually applied the entropy measure as a measure of product variety using data on product characteristics. <br>
- entropy used in economics e.g. as a measure of industrial concentration as an alternative to the Herfindahl-index (Theil 1967; Zadjenweber 1972; Krehm 1977)<br>
- other applications of entropy statistics include analysis of inequality (theil 1967) and of input-output tables (Theil 1967; Batten 1983)<br>
- in sociology, racial distributions at different levels of aggregation (Theil 1972)<br>
- in innovation studies, as measure of variety in patents and R&amp;D expenditure of different technologies (Grupp 1990; Kodama 1990; Carpenter and Templé 1996)<br>
- in scientometrics, as analyses of word and citation distributions (Leydesdorff 1991, 1992, 1995)

</p>

<br>
<br>

<p>
- ij…w are alleles, p_ij…w is the frequency at which a design with alleles ij…w occurs (e.g. <br>
- entropy measured in bits using logarithm two<br>
- the higher the entropy of a distribution, the larger its dispersion<br>
- in context of frequency distributions of designs described in terms of alleles, entropy can be considered as an indicator of product variety<br>
- entropy is zero when all products persent are designed in exactly the same way. This design has frequency one and all other designs have zero frequency, thus:
</p>

<p>
H(X_1,X_2,...,X_N)=-1 \cdot log_2 (1) = 0
</p>

<br>
<br>

Maximum entropy limited by the size of design space S; When all S possible combinations of alleles have an equal frequency, frequency for all designs p_ij…w = 1/S. The entropy of this distribution equals (Theil 1972:6) <br>
H(X_1,X_2,...,X_N)=-S \cdot \left (  \frac{1}{S}\right ) \cdot log_2 \left (  \frac{1}{S}\right ) = -log_2 \left (  \frac{1}{S}\right ) = log_2 (S)

Example of calculating intermediate entropy (2-allele system):
</p>

<p>
Frequencies<br>
p_00 = 0.45<br>
p_01 = 0.30<br>
p_10 = 0.15<br>
p_11 = 0.10
</p>

<p>
Marginal frequencies<br>
p_0 = 0.75<br>
p_1 = 0.25<br>
p_.0 = 0.60<br>
p_.1 = 0.40
</p>

<p>
H(X_1, X_2) = -[0.45 \cdot log_2 (0.45)} - [0.3 \cdot log_2 (0.3)] - [0.15 \cdot log_2 (0.15] - [0.1 \cdot log_2 (0.1)] = 1.78 bits

5.1.3 Average disaggregated entropy
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
The difference between the total industry entropy and the average firm entropy informs one about the degree of specialisation among firms within an industry. <br>
- there is maximum specialisation when each firm offers only one variety of product designs<br>
- there is minimum specialisation when each firm offers the same variety of product designs
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
- e.g. low degree of specialization: if in an industry hundred products are offered with a frequency distribution of product desings being p_00 = 0.4, p_01 = 0.3, p_10 = 0.2, p_11 0.1, Entropy H(x_1, x_2) = 1.85 bits. Four firms present in the industry. 
</p>

<p>
Firm 1 offers 13 products "00", 15 products "01", 8 products "10 and 4 products "11", total of 40 products (out of 100, hence 0.4):<br>
H_1 (X_1, X_2) = 0.13/0.4 log_2 (0.13/0.4) + 0.15/0.4 log_2 (0.15/0.4) + (0.08/0.4 log_2 (0.08/0.4) + 0.04/0.4 log_2 (0.04/0.4) = 1.85 bits
</p>

<p>
Firm 2 offers 9 "00", 5 "01", 4 "10", and 2 "11", total of 20 products THERE IS AN ERROR!!! adds up to 19!!
</p>

<p>
H_1 (X_1, X_2) =  0.09/0.19 log_2 (0.09/0.19) … = 1.81 bits<br>
Firm 3: 1.81 bits<br>
Firm 4: 1.81 bits
</p>

<p>
Average entropy <br>
\overline{H}(X_1, X_2) = (0.4 \cdot 1.85) + (0.19 \cdot 1.81) + (0.2 \cdot 1.81) + (0.21 \cdot 1.81) = 1.83 \text{ bits}
</p>

<br>
<br>
<br>

<p>
Degree of specialization calculated from industry-level entropy:
</p>

<p>
\frac{\overline{H} (X_1, X_2)}{H (X_1, X_2)} \cdot 100 \% = \frac{1.83}{1.85} \cdot 100 \% = 98.9 \%
