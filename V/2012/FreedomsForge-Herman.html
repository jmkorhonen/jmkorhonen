<p>
Mobilization
</p>

<p>
“Within hours he sent an urgent message to Congress, asking that the $24 million appropriation for the Army be expanded to $700 million. He said, “This nation should plan at this time a program that will provide us with 50,000 military and naval planes…. I should like to see this nation geared up to the ability to turn out at least 50,000 planes a year.”
</p>


<hr>

<br>

<p>
“The country was stunned. Charles Lindbergh, a key figure in the opposition to getting entangled in Europe and self-appointed guru on all things relating to aviation, dismissed the numbers as “hysterical chatter.” Republican leader Senator Vandenberg of Michigan warned that “it would take more than appropriations to make a national defense.” The president of the Air Transport Association of America said it was “fooling the people” to raise unrealistic hopes about how many planes could be made and when they could be delivered.20”
</p>


<hr>

<br>

<p>
“In 1938 they had barely supplied the Army Air Corps with ninety planes a month.21 Now the White House was telling them they wanted planes by the thousands.”
</p>


<hr>

<br>

<p>
“Knudsen knew M-Day was a fantasy. It made no allowance for what Knudsen would call “lead time”: the time needed for a conversion effort. Based on his own experience at Ford in World War I, he calculated that would be about eighteen months.”
</p>


<hr>

<br>

<p>
“Then there were the tax laws. Every American company’s investment in new plant construction, tools, and other physical resources necessary to produce a plane or tank or aircraft, even with a contract, took sixteen years in order to be fully deducted as a business expense. Knudsen saw at once that these amortization rules (Knudsen had to get John Biggers to explain to the president and Cabinet what amortization meant) made the short-term investment in plant, property, and equipment necessary for the defense buildup almost impossible.21”
</p>


<hr>

<br>

<p>
“Mr. President,” Knudsen said, “do you want statistics, or do you want guns?” If the latter, he explained, then amortization should be drastically shortened to five or six years. Hitler’s German companies, he pointed out, worked on a seven-year rule. Companies would get their investment back quicker, and be more willing to take risks on manufacturing things that had no commercial value to them but were crucial to the defense effort.”
</p>


<hr>

<br>

<p>
“A single Wright Cyclone 14-cylinder 1700-horsepower engine required 8,500 separate parts, 80,000 machine operations, and 50,000 inspections”
</p>


<hr>

<br>

<p>
“BY OCTOBER, BILL Knudsen could report that he had overseen some 920 contracts worth nearly $3 billion for the Army and $6 billion for the Navy. More than five hundred companies had been drawn in to make everything from ships and tanks and aircraft engines to eleven new gunpowder”
</p>


<hr>

<br>

<p>
“Knudsen also sensed that the auto industry was poised to be a model for the future of the American economy. Everywhere Knudsen looked, he saw an American industrial base woefully unprepared for the scale of demands that would be placed on it. He stunned one audience of politicians and businessmen at the Carleton Hotel by stating that the war effort was going to require a complete retooling of nearly every American factory over the next eighteen months.”
</p>


<hr>

<br>

<p>
“Doolittle laid out a series of engine and equipment parts. There were also complete displays of bomber subassemblies in the nearby Graham-Paige auto plant for the executives to examine. The major stressed that the Army Air Corps needed bombers as well as fighters, and needed them now. “Here are the parts we need,” Doolittle said in closing. “Pick out the ones you can build.”
</p>


<hr>

<br>

<p>
“At the same time, they agreed, also at Knudsen’s request, to suspend all annual model changes for automobiles, thus freeing up time usually spent retooling to concentrate on plane production. In pure marketing terms, it seemed a suicidal move, particularly with less than one-quarter of Americans thinking the United States should be involved in the war in Europe. But it was a major step in getting American business into wartime production—and all more than a year before Pearl Harbor.21”
</p>


<hr>

<br>

<p>
“United Auto Workers’ president Walter Reuther presented his own plan. His workers could easily produce five hundred planes a day, he told government officials. Reuther declared that almost half of the plant capacity at Ford, GM, Chrysler, and the others was underutilized (the automakers themselves said it was far less). By pooling machine tools, the labor leader said, they could convert that space to produce the wings and fuselages for fighters, and convert auto engine plants to make aircraft engines by the thousands. Meanwhile, a national aviation production board would give labor, government, and business equal say in how to do it.25<br>
When Reuther unveiled his plan in early December, the press and public were agog. Convert the auto industry to aircraft production! Why hadn’t anyone thought of that before?”
</p>


<hr>

<br>

<p>
“The auto union leader didn’t seem to realize that whereas the average automobile consisted of perhaps 15,000 separate parts, a twin-engined bomber like the B-25 Mitchell demanded 165,000 parts—plus 150,000 rivets. No existing auto plant, no matter how carefully retooled, was ready to produce so complex a piece of machinery, let alone five hundred a day of varying sizes and weights.”
</p>


<hr>

<br>

<p>
“The Knudsen Plan was less spectacular but more rooted in reality. The Air Corps had figured it would take at least twenty months to convert existing auto plants to large-scale airplane assembly. Getting them ready to stamp out parts and subassemblies would take far less time. The Knudsen Plan let airplane makers make airplanes—even eventually planes they hadn’t themselves designed.† Automakers and their subcontractors would concentrate on making whatever would help save time for final assembly.”
</p>


<hr>

<br>

<p>
“This is a job calling for quantity and quality,” he told colleagues on the Advisory Commission; “it is absolutely necessary to have an engineering boss on every job.”31 In fact, Knudsen told Roosevelt point-blank that only corporations with their own engineering departments should get the most vital defense contracts. Those engineers would have had years of experience figuring out how to make things in the greatest number and the fastest possible time—an experience that was going to get more common as America geared up for war.”
</p>


<hr>

<br>

<p>
“Decentralization [is] analogous to free enterprise,” to quote Alfred Sloan. “Centralization, to regimentation.”33”
</p>


<hr>

<br>

<p>
“Yet neither then nor later did Roosevelt ever sign on to the idea of taking full charge of the economy in order to prepare for war—or appointing an all-powerful “war production czar.” Perhaps he also instinctively grasped that the war mobilization effort was too big a task for one plan or person—that, in Eliot Janeway’s phrase, “a victory small enough to be organized is too small to be decisive.”37”
</p>


<hr>

<br>

<p>
“The other was the creation of the Office of Production Management to replace the NDAC. Advice and encouragement would no longer do the job. A new body was needed that could make decisions and issue directives, with a single head in charge of mobilizing American industry for the war effort. Stimson, Knox, and Henry Morgenthau all agreed on who that person should be: Bill Knudsen.”
</p>


<hr>

<br>

<p>
“Some 50,000 planes, 130,000 engines, 380 Navy ships, 9,200 tanks, and 17,000 heavy guns, plus rifles, helmets, and clothing for an army of 1.4 million men, were being made or under contract to be made. Plant facilities to arm another 2 million, and get a two-ocean navy of 800 ships out to sea, were on their way, as well. Knudsen had calculated all this would require some 18 billion man-hours of mind-bending, back-straining labor—and he sensed that was still a long way from being enough.”
</p>


<hr>

<br>

<p>
“And he knew this particular ship design and the demands it would make on his engineers, foremen, and workers. It required steel plates, each weighing several tons, to be molded and cut into 435 different shapes and an even more bewildering variety of sizes. His Portland operation would be ordering 7,500 components from 600 different suppliers, from condensers and switches to wires, pumps, and the engines themselves.13”
</p>


<hr>

<br>

<p>
“Babe” Meigs (a nickname owing to the fact he was six foot four) had reported that total plane production was up to 1,450 a month; the goal was 2,600 by October. Knudsen estimated they would hit 3,000 to 3,500 a month before 1942 was out.2”
</p>


<hr>

<br>

<p>
“That was the magic number: eighteen months. That’s how long Knudsen estimated it would take for American business and industry to make the arsenal of democracy a reality. One year to build new plants and retool the old ones, six months for conversion.<br>
Everywhere he looked, that number held true. A year for tooling for airplane engines, maybe ten months with overtime. A year to tool for tanks of thirty to thirty-one tons. Nine to eleven months for a TNT plant.5 Then another six months before everyone would see full production—enough guns, tanks, planes, and bombs to sweep Germany and its Axis allies into oblivion.”
</p>


<hr>

<br>

<p>
“The first part of Knudsen’s plan had been under way since the previous June. New plant construction had been booming for almost a year, with Jesse Jones putting up more than $33 million for new facility construction for War Department orders.11 Some 784 new factories had been started and more than half were finished.12 Thanks to miracle workers like Albert Kahn, the work went even faster than many thought possible. K. T. Keller came to Kahn on a Wednesday looking to build Chrysler a new machine shop five hundred feet wide and two-thirds of a mile long. Kahn had the plans ready by Friday morning, and ninety days later the building was going up.13”
</p>


<hr>

<br>

<p>
“Bill Knudsen caught up with him at the association’s annual meeting at the Hotel Cleveland on May 5 and 6. Though Geier’s prediction of war had been borne out by events, he was still amazed when Bill Knudsen told him he wanted production of machine tools in America to double, redouble, and redouble again—all inside a year.17<br>
“You’re crazy,” Geier said good-naturedly, “but then so are we. When do you want them?”<br>
“Right away,” Knudsen answered with a straight face, “and in the ratio I mentioned.” Geier knew Knudsen well enough to know he meant it.18”
</p>


<hr>

<br>

<p>
“Over the next months, they and their factories would labor round the clock to produce a bewildering range of machine tools. In 1940 they had produced some 110,000. In what was left of 1941, they nearly doubled that number, to 185,000.19 By 1942, Geier’s Cincinnati Milling Machine was making a new machine tool every seventeen minutes, seven days a week, around the clock.”
</p>


<hr>

<br>

<p>
“nudsen and Geier did not stop there. In late June they launched a nationwide survey to track down every machine tool made in America in the past ten years, especially twenty-one types that were considered critical to the defense industry. Knudsen put OPM’s tool man, Mason Britton, on the scent of “idle” tools, so that used tools could be mobilized as well as new ones.21<br>
The amazing machine tool production numbers fell off in 1943 and slid back to normal by 1944. But by then the necessary machines were in the factories and doing their job.”
</p>


<hr>

<br>

<p>
“At the same time, the first round of curtailment of civilian production had begun.<br>
First came the auto industry, with a drastic cut by more than half. Then in October nonessential construction was ordered halted, to divert materials to defense plant construction. On October 21 manufacturers had to stop using copper in almost all civilian products, followed by sharp cuts in refrigerators, vacuum cleaners, metal office furniture, and similar durable goods.”
</p>


<hr>

<br>

<p>
“No one who read the newspapers knew it yet, but the tap was about to be turned on. In January 1941 defense spending rose to triple what it had been during the previous six months. By July it quintupled, and December it jumped another twelvefold. America, the isolationist nation still at peace, was fast approaching Nazi Germany in its defense output. In 1942 it would roar past it.”
</p>


<hr>

<br>

<p>
“On the Tuesday after Pearl Harbor, a somber Roosevelt summoned Knudsen to the White House. He had already seen Knudsen’s report on production in 1941. The numbers were impressive: 19,290 planes, 50,684 aircraft engines, 97,000 machine guns, 9,924 40mm Bofors antiaircraft guns, 3,964 tanks, and more.4 Now the president said he wanted those numbers accelerated. He needed 30,000 planes in 1942 instead of the 18,000 Knudsen and his team had projected. He wanted 45,000 tanks, and 75,000 in 1943; 20,000 antiaircraft guns; and 8 million tons of merchant shipping instead of the 1.1 million tons produced in 1941.<br>
“Can we do it?” Roosevelt wanted to know.<br>
“Yes, sir,” Knudsen answered at once. He and his team had figured out that 45,000 planes of all types for 1942 was not out of the question.”
</p>

“A new “Rule of Three” would take root in the American munitions business. In the first year after a production order, output was bound to triple; in the second, it would jump by a factor of seven; at the end of the third year, the only limits on output were material and labor—whether it was trucks or artillery pieces or bombs or planes.”

“Assembly-line production had come to America’s shipyards. By August the prefab yard had 2,500 workers, with 42 women welders and burners—and ships were ready that were 95 percent preassembled.30 The time it took to launch a Liberty ship plummeted, while the man-hours required fell by almost half. The Kaiser yards had already found ways to reduce the time to build a ship from 220 days to 105. Now Clay Bedford was pointing the way to 50 days or less.<br>
At Portland, applying those same preassemblies was transformational. Edgar Kaiser’s tenth ship, Robert Fulton, had taken 154 days. In April the Henry W. Longfellow finished in 86 days, and in May the James Whitcomb Riley in 73. Edgar pushed his team still harder. In July, Hull No. 230, the Thomas Bailey Aldrich, got finished in just 43 days.31”

“Then, at 3:27 P.M. on November 12, the Robert E. Peary was launched, just four days, fifteen hours, and twenty-six minutes after laying the keel. The wife of Jimmy Byrnes, Maude Byrnes, swung the champagne bottle, the crowd roared its approval, and Hull No. 440 entered history. Six minutes later the blocks for laying the keel for the next Liberty ship, Hull No. 443, were in place.43”

“Nelson also discovered the president had given him enormous powers compared to his predecessor. “We had authority to force a manufacturer to accept a contract,” as he described it later, “and we occasionally employed it.” Nelson could also requisition private property for war use, and he could order production of certain civilian goods halted.2”

“As I understood my job,” Nelson would write later, “it wasn’t up to me to tell industry how to do its job; it was our function to show industry what had to be done and then to do everything in our power to enable industry to do it”—including stepping in if the marketplace couldn’t deliver fast enough.9”

“In 1941 the United States had made 3,964 tanks—more than twice the number of the past three years. In 1942 it produced 24,754. In 1941 it produced 617,000 small arms and 97,000 machine guns. In 1942 the numbers swelled to 2.3 million and 663,000, respectively. Whereas the previous year saw 318 B-17 and B-24 heavy bombers coming off the assembly line, 1942 saw 2,618—along with 136,000 aircraft engines, 92,000 20mm antiaircraft guns (versus 2,042 in 1941), 20,000 75mm guns, and 10 million rounds of small-arms ammunition. As for total production of airplanes, it reached 47,873—just shy of the 50,000 Roosevelt had asked for just two years earlier, and which all the experts had said was impossible.22<br>
Before 1942 was out, the United States was producing more war materiel than all three Axis powers—Germany, Italy, and Japan—combined.”

“Chrysler’s success with the tank arsenal earned it its first Army-Navy “E” pennant for production excellence on August 10, 1942. The “E” award, too, had been Knudsen’s idea, as a way to give manufacturers public recognition for the best war production achievements.26”

“Bill Knudsen had foreseen it all. “I placed most of the business with big companies for the reason that there was a lot of engineering to be done on practically every job,” he wrote later. “They were the only ones who had that kind of talent.” But the subcontractors and “little business had an enormous part in the program,” once full conversion got going.18”

“And conversion did roll as smoothly as Ernest Kanzler’s tuxedo lapels. When civilian production halted at Plymouth’s Lynch Road plant and the old machine tools were pulled out, the new ones were in place by the time the night shift arrived. At Buick, workers gathered to cheer as the last car came down the line. On its windscreen was a sign: “Until Total Victory We Dedicate Ourselves to the Objective ‘When Better War Goods Are Built, Buick Workmen Will Build Them.’ ”

“Knudsen didn’t think much of this idea. By now he understood the profound difference in the numbers of parts Sorensen was used to working with, versus a four-engined bomber like the B-24. A car demanded 15,000 parts; a B-24 almost half a million, plus 300,000 rivets in five hundred different sizes. The aviation industry had a completely different way of making dies for shaping parts—and airplane makers needed to be ready to change their engineering in order to keep up with a myriad of aeronautical variables, as well as those in combat.”

“The issue was finally put to rest when Nelson’s assistant and investment banker Ferdinand Eberstadt devised the Controlled Materials Plan, which matched the supplies of critical raw materials like steel, copper, and aluminum directly to orders from the War and Navy departments”

“Supplying the packing material was Dow Chemical Company, which had invented a clear plastic sheeting that sealed every tank, machine gun, and airplane part tight against moisture and dust. It was called Saran, and so Saran Wrap made its debut solving one of World War II’s most difficult logistical problems.”

“That was nothing, however, compared to the other problem with the steel dies. Two years after it had first flown, the B-24’s design was constantly evolving. Changes demanded by Air Force command based on battlefield conditions, or new discoveries by Mac Laddon and his team on how to improve performance, forced modifications in how the plane was made, down to the tiniest subsection. Ford was learning that they barely had time to install their new expensive steel dies before they had to be junked. That meant not only new dies but changing the machine tools to fit them, and often a different jig to handle the altered part. That first year, the Air Force ordered 575 master changes alone—and all the while everyone was wondering where Ford’s B-24s were.<br>
It drove Sorensen to near fury.”

It drove Sorensen to near fury. “We would agree on freezing a design, then be ready to go ahead,” he remembered later. “Back from the fighting fronts would come complaints or suggestions regarding certain features, and the plane designers came through with alterations in design with no consideration for the production program.”22”

“Then they would head for the parking lot. Knudsen would walk down the rows of employees’ cars, pausing to point out a worn tire or a broken headlight, sometimes crawling under the car to trace an oil leak. “Get those fixed,” he would tell the manager. “Defense workers always get priority on new tires or retreads. You don’t want a blowout or a breakdown keeping an employee away from work.” Knudsen never expected every car problem to get fixed. But he was sending a message to the higher-ups: Make sure all your workers get to work. Absenteeism could be as much a threat to the production schedule as a materials shortage or a labor strike.28”
</p>


<hr>

<p>
“Nothing’s the matter,” Knudsen said. “If your office, or the War Department, would quit making last-minute changes and leave the Martin people alone, they will make you planes that will fly.”<br>
Patterson was startled and barked, “What do you mean?”<br>
“I think we should freeze the designs for a while so we can get some airplanes,” Knudsen said. Trying to stay up to the minute on specifications at the factory end only meant being late on every plane and design. “What I think we should do to keep abreast of things is build the airplanes first and add whatever improvements are necessary at some place especially equipped to do that.”31<br>
Patterson thought about it, and agreed. It marked the start of the Air Force’s field modification program. In January 1942 the Materiel Division set up ten modification centers, the first of which was in Cheyenne, Wyoming. At first everyone thought the aircraft companies themselves would do the modifying at the centers, but Douglas, North American, and the rest already had their hands full.”
</p>

<p>
“Here clearly was the answer to Sorensen and the Air Force’s problems. Let Willow Run build the bombers as is, ready to fly to modification centers where the field changes the generals wanted could be done bomber by bomber, instead of interrupting the flow of assembly-line production. And that meant complete bombers, not subassemblies or unfinished knockdowns.”
</p>


<hr>

<br>

<p>
“Ford had turned a plane that used to cost two hundred thousand man-hours to make into one that cost only eighteen thousand hours. Willow Run built half of all the Liberators made during the war. But it had been a bitter, exhausting journey.”
</p>


<hr>

<br>

<p>
“Eighty-six percent of the people Bechtel and McCone hired to do the modification had never worked with airplanes before. More than half were women. But they carried out the immensely complicated and time-consuming work of removing parts of planes that required modification or replacement—parts sometimes buried deep in the engine or fuselage underneath a bewildering network of wires, hoses, or other parts—and replacing or altering them according to Air Force Materiel Command directives that, in the course of a single day, might cover a wall of the supervisor’s office. Some planes required as much as fifteen to sixteen hundred hours of labor.”

“In 1943 the numbers Knudsen and his colleagues had promised were taking on a life of their own. Production of Liberty ships was reaching 160 a month, while 18,434 Navy battleships, cruisers, carriers, subs, and destroyers poured out of America’s shipyards—along with 16,000 landing craft. Heavy bombers soared from 2,618 in 1942 to 9,616”

“Tank production swelled to 29,495; small arms from 2.3 million in 1942 to almost 7 million; artillery shells from 693,000 to 800,000 tons; machine guns to 830,000; and airplanes of all kinds to 85,946”

“As late as May 1941, chairman Alfred Sloan scoffed at the idea that war was coming—and Sloan insisted on keeping GM’s overseas operations in Germany and Japan going far longer than even his close friends thought politically expedient.9<br>
Yet when war came, GM shot from an almost standing start to converting almost 90 percent of its forty-one operating divisions to munitions production as war product sales shot from $406 million in 1941 to $3.5 billion in 1943. The automaking giant adopted a new slogan, “Victory Is Our Business,” and business turned out to be pretty good. It saw net sales of $13.4 billion, and a net profit of $673 million.”

“At nearly eighty, the man from Reading was the oldest defense contractor in World War II. But his wasn’t the smallest business. That honor belonged to Clyde Walling of Cleveland, Ohio. Mr. Walling was president of a tool company that operated out of his two-car garage while he parked his car in the driveway to make room. By May 1941 he had an employee force of exactly three men.15<br>
Subcontractors like Walling were the lifeblood of the American free enterprise system, as Bill Knudsen well knew.”

“Ma and Pa Harrington’s “defense plant,” for example, was a white clapboard farmhouse on a lonely crossroads near Rockford, Illinois. There they made machine tools for turning artillery shells and tank turrets, one thousand dollars a month’s worth right in their living room, while the rest of the house doubled and tripled as home office, sales branch, and factory. Their twin sons worked with them. They had started the business in the middle of the Depression, by borrowing some money to build a machine shop. When Richard and Russell Harrington learned that their main tool was going to cost more than four thousand dollars, they made their own out of a junked lathe, an old washing machine motor, and an oil pump salvaged from a 1926 Chevrolet. Their mother’s old washtub caught the oil that leaked from the bottom of the homemade tool.”
</p>

“When war came, the Harrington brothers pressed their father and mother into helping. Ma Harrington would run the lathes making parts for tank turrets and gun mounts before washing hands to make dinner. Pa Harrington, age sixty-eight, worked the grinder and would comment to visitors, “I have more fun than a kid in this place.” The first visitors were inspectors from the Harringtons’ various prime contractors, who simply could not believe parts of this quality were being turned out in the quaint house with its gambrel roof, dormer windows, and flower boxes under every windowsill.”

“Production, however, remained an entirely voluntary process. The War Production Board could and did order companies not to produce things: new cars, for instance, and refrigerators and other heavy durable goods. It never told anyone what to make. That was left to the imagination of American business.<br>
This was how Bill Knudsen had designed things from the start, and it remained the pivot point of the entire wartime system. Everything made for the war effort was made by those who saw some advantage for themselves in doing so, and therefore they brought all their skills and tools and knowledge to bear on the task—both to help the country and to make some money.”
</p>


<hr>

<br>

<p>
“The process kicked off even before the war began in the spring of 1941, when a magazine such as Business Week began running stories on how to snag defense contracts by conversion to wartime production. It offered advice in answer to queries like “I would like to sell some shovels to the Army, but its purchases run to much larger quantities than I can handle,” or “We have a canning plant which will probably be idle and could be used for war contracts. Can you tell us how to contact the proper parties?”25 There was advice on where to write in order to get government loans to help with conversion: the RFC or the Defense Contracts Division of OPM. In addition, it said, the Army and Navy both made advances of up to 30 percent for prime contractors. Business Week also offered free advice on what materials to use as substitutes for those too hard to get for civilian production: plastic for aluminum film spools, say, or cast iron for brass bicycle locks. Human ingenuity could solve problems that government planning or rationing could not.”
</p>

“When war came, the scramble for defense contracts produced an extraordinary book published by the Research Institute of America, called Your Business Goes to War.26 Page by page it told firms whom to contact for getting a government contract and how to draft one up. It explained where and how to get critical materials, how to work with the priority system, and how to deal with labor under the new wartime laws such as the rules concerning overtime. It offered several pages of suggestions on what products a company could offer to make. (See Appendix B)”

“If, for example, you made vacuum cleaners, there might be a place for you manufacturing gas-mask parts. A razor manufacturer might want to look into percussion primers for artillery shells; an office furniture company, into making bomb containers. A shoe company could make helmet linings; a maker of bottle caps and bottlers could turn out .50-caliber tripod mounts; while a lawn mower company might offer to machine shrapnel.27”

“Other companies have already done it, was the message. You can do it, too. “There is an alternative,” its author added in the preface. “It is the shouted order, the broadcast ultimatum, the decision made by an unchallengeable Führer” in which “the executive becomes a clerk in the national warehouse.” No one wanted that. But there was also another implicit message: Those companies who adapt to the new wartime conditions will survive and even thrive. Those who do not will not.”
</p>


<hr>

<br>

<p>
“To that degree, wartime conditions reproduced important features of peacetime market conditions. The Army and Navy were like classic customers: demanding, even finicky, and reluctant to pay except for exceptional service. Contracts flowed to those who could produce at the most competitive rate—and after 1943 both services could force producers to renegotiate contracts if they thought the profits or costs excessive.28 There were no favored state industries as in Nazi Germany or Japan. No state subsidy was on hand to save the incompetent or underperformer. But on the other hand, a raft of timely government loans could leapfrog a newcomer over his staid competitors. In wartime as in peacetime, entrepreneurs challenged the old established firms, as Henry Kaiser and a dozen others proved. The small and nimble rose up to compete with the large and slow-moving.”

“This rule didn’t just apply to existing business. The war produced more than half a million new businesses, which became the hinge of change from the prewar to the postwar economy.29<br>
There was, for example, Frank Hobbs and his partner George Comstock. Hobbs had grown up in California before moving to Portland, Oregon, to open his own Firestone tire dealership when he was barely out of his teens. Then, in the teeth of the Depression, Hobbs launched his own company to produce Masonite wallboard using superhard paint finishes as a substitute for more expensive tile. Soon he had perfected a process and substance he called Colotyle. It became a low-cost alternative to tile in kitchens and bathrooms up and down the West Coast. Henry Kaiser even used it for the heads in his Liberty ships.”
</p>


<hr>

<br>

<p>
“The coming of war was for Hobbs just another business opportunity. In the spring of 1942, someone showed him the bulky, steel-ribbed shelters the Army was shipping out from Quonset, Rhode Island, for troops who would have to serve in the frozen wastes of Alaska. Hobbs was shocked. The huts were not only awkward and heavy to ship, but wasted that all-important critical wartime material, steel. He and his business partner George Comstock came up with the idea of a lightweight version made of hard-coated wood—a sturdy plywood igloo. Three weeks later they showed a model to the Army Corps of Engineers, Seattle District, who immediately ordered eighty-five more test huts. In no time Pacific Huts, with Hobbs as president and Comstock as vice president, had a contract for one thousand.30”
</p>


<hr>

<br>

<p>
“Hobbs’s Fox Avenue factory turned out more than 12,000 Pacific huts before the war ended. In Alaska thousands were left where they were erected when the Army withdrew. For four decades they stood forgotten and abandoned through snow, rain, and ice storms. Then in the 1990s the Pentagon sent out their Defense Environmental Restoration Program to survey the sites for demolition. They found that not only had Hobbs’s huts weathered the decades better than the steel Quonsets, but most of them were intact and still livable.31”

“War production had triggered the greatest mass migration in American history.<br>
At least 20 million Americans left their homes to find work in the new and old plants. At the end of the war, 15.3 million of them were living someplace other than where they were the day Pearl Harbor was bombed. As in the era of the covered wagons, Americans followed the call of opportunity—in this case opportunities created not by the birth of a nation but by the rebirth of American industry. If business profits rose during the war, labor’s wages rose much more—an average of 70 percent.33 It was either a very happy or very complacent worker who wouldn’t get himself and his family on the”

“At least seven million left America’s farms, especially in the South.34 Five and half million of those went to work in factories and cities; the rest went into the military. But instead of this being a disaster for the nation’s ability to feed itself, farm payrolls fell by only a million.35 Because if farmers were fewer on the ground, they were far from idle. They turned to mechanization and chemical fertilizers to make their acres more productive, so much so they also expanded pasturage for livestock by 22 percent. Some complained that Washington’s restrictions on manufacture of machinery like tractors and harvesters made conversion that much harder. Some lamented that the big farms were devouring the small inefficient ones as well as the abandoned homesteads.36<br>
But it was this concentration and mechanization that made it possible for American farmers to feed not only their own country better than it had been fed before the Depression, but their Allies, as well. By the time the war was over, they were ready to feed a devastated Europe for almost five years. After that, they would go on to feed the world”

“Randolph, however, was adamant. Recognizing the Negroes’ equal right to work and serve in uniform, he wrote Knudsen, was partly what American democracy was all about. To Roosevelt he wrote a very different letter. He was prepared, he told the president on May 29, to mobilize “from ten to fifty thousand Negroes to march on Washington in the interest of securing jobs … in national defense” as well as integration in the armed forces.40<br>
Roosevelt sensed a looming public relations disaster both for himself and for the Democratic Party, which was becoming increasingly successful in poaching black voters away from the Republicans, in spite of the Democrats’ record supporting segregation in the Deep South. The president tried to get his wife, Eleanor, an acknowledged civil rights champion, Mayor Fiorello La Guardia, and others to talk Randolph out of the march. Nothing could move the black union leader. So finally, facing the prospect of a flood of black protesters flooding the National Mall and surrounding the Lincoln Memorial, Roosevelt backed down. He issued Executive Order 8802 six days before the march was supposed to start. Randolph graciously canceled the day of protest.<br>

“Once the women set to work, however, the joke was on the males. The ladies of Vultee showed enormous skill at the subassemblies, running, threading, connecting, and checking electrical cables.

North American was impressed enough that they began substituting women for men in their tubing department. Production jumped by 20 percent. Before long, everyone was hiring women for other departments, and they ran milling machines, drill presses, and complex cutout saws and worked in aircraft engine assembling.”

Fights and brawls and slacking on the job were common.

“Kaiser had been the nation’s master shipbuilder. Overnight some wondered if he was also a careless one. The Esso Manhattan had been built by Sun Shipbuilding and Dry Dock, one of the country’s biggest and most experienced yards; the Wynkoop by Delta. But the story the papers carried was about the Kaiser yard’s Schenectady. Calls for investigation began. How much of our new 24 million tons of merchant shipping, critics were asking, was actually going to fall apart at sea thanks to Kaiser’s slipshod methods?”

“That July a special subcommittee of the House Committee on Merchant Marine and Fisheries weighed in, chaired by a freshman congressman from Washington State named Henry M. Jackson—“Scoop” to his friends. Jackson pointed out that only two out of more than a thousand Liberty ships had actually been lost, with no loss of life. Neither of the two, Thomas Hooker and J.L.M. Curry, had been built in Kaiser yards. The Truman Committee cleared Kaiser of any malfeasance and pronounced the Liberty ship “the truck horse of the fleet.”27 No one suggested stopping the building program, let alone halting Kaiser’s own operations.<br>
But rumors continued right to the end of the war, and afterward. With wartime censorship, who knew how many ships were lost the government wasn’t telling us about?”

“To Kaiser, the image was irresistible. There had been some talk at the War Production Board of giving him a contract to build the Martin plane, but he jumped instead at Hughes’s plane. “These ships could land 500,000 fully equipped men in England in a single day,” he enthused to Time. “The next day they could fly over again with 70,000 tons of fresh milk, beefsteaks, sugar and bombs.”33 He learned that General Hap Arnold had turned Hughes’s superplane down flat—but then, Arnold had turned down Kaiser once as well. He heard aviation executives like Donald Douglas and Jack Northrop tell him the idea was insane—but then, traditional shipbuilders had said the same thing when he set out to build Liberty ships.‡<br>
He declared that he and Hughes could have five thousand megaplanes in the air inside of two years, even though Consolidated’s master of mass production, Harry Woodhead, warned him it couldn’t be done in less than four.34”

“But he was furious that Hughes’s engineers hadn’t told their boss the aeronautical truth: while the plane’s lift went up as the square of its linear dimensions, its weight went up as a cube of those dimensions. The “square-cube” law had doomed the project from the start, plywood or no plywood. The Spruce Goose might get off the ground but it would never fly—let alone across the Atlantic.”

“As 1944 began, 70 percent of America’s manufacturing was focused on wartime production. American factories were building a plane every five minutes, and producing 150 tons of steel every minute. Shipyards were launching eight aircraft carriers a month, including Kaiser’s baby flattops, and fifty merchant ships a day.<br>
Day and night, endless freight trains loaded with raw materials and finished war goods moved east and west to outfit a 12-million-strong American military and provide its British, Australian, Russian, and other allies almost $1 billion worth of aid a month—the equivalent of $50 billion in today’s dollars. The effort required more than 142 million carloads—the most massive cargo lift in human history.‖ Yet, amazingly, while all this prodigious production was happening, more than half of America’s businesses were still cranking out goods and services for the civilian sector, from shoes and lightbulbs to paint and restaurant supplies and newsprint for the funny papers—including some, like GE and DuPont, who were the biggest war contractors.”

“Knudsen learned that was not going to be easy. What amazed him, touring aircraft plants on both coasts and the Midwest, was how confident everyone was that America was going to win, and win without effort. He feared it was beginning to affect production schedules, as both managers and workers were unwilling to work flat-out—in fact, people were feeling more and more free to take time off. The very success he and his colleagues had achieved, of making war production look simple and straightforward, had its downside. “In general, everyone patriotically supports the war,” he told Don Nelson and his WPB colleagues back in July, “but too many are confident of an early and easy victory”—this, almost four months before the battle for Tarawa and almost a year before D-day.11”

“All in all, the B-29 was turning out to be the most massive project in the history of aeronautics. It was also, in the words of historian Tom Collison, “the most organizational airplane ever built.”34 American business had never before been asked to undertake an industrial project of this size or cost or complexity. Even the Manhattan Project turned out to be cheaper. Boeing and its partners set up a Liaison Committee to supervise the entire effort, which included representatives of the biggest of Boeing’s one hundred major subcontractors: Chrysler, Goodyear, Hudson Motors, McDonnell of St. Louis, and Republic Aviation. Major government agencies agreed to stay away. Production and development of the B-29 was left to American business and the Army. In the process, a new working relationship would be forged that would last long after World War II.”

“Even as construction of the Wichita plant got started, Boeing production managers realized they were facing a massive problem: No one, not even Ford at Willow Run, had come up with an assembly-line layout that could handle the gargantuan size and staggering complexity of the Superfortress, with 40,540 different parts and a million rivets. The solution Boeing came up with was something not even Sorensen or Knudsen or the other denizens of mass production had ever contemplated. Boeing production engineer Oliver West had developed it with his counterparts at Douglas and Lockheed for building the BVD Flying Fortress, and dubbed it “multi-lining.”

“The multi-assembly-line method marked yet another revolution in American manufacturing. First tried at Wichita, it became standard at all the Superfortress plants. Compared to Willow Run, with its long, winding L-shaped construction, a B-29 plant could be built as a square or rectangle: a huge cost saving both for Boeing and the government. And it meant parts didn’t have to travel as far on the plant floor, a saving of time and man-hours impossible to achieve at a plant like Willow Run. It also required fewer workstations than the standard auto single assembly line, and had the flexibility to introduce new engineering modifications almost as part of the flow of production, instead of forcing everything to come to a halt while changes were made.37”

“no airplane ever required more modifications, both on and off line, than the B-29. It was not only the most expensive machine ever produced, but the most complex. From nose to tail, a B-29 consisted of more than 40,000 different parts—compared to a measly 25,000 for a B-24 Liberator. Building one also required Boeing production managers to keep track of fourteen hundred subcontractors, both large (like GE and Bendix, who made the automated gun turrets, and DuPont, who made the Plexiglas observation blisters) and small, who were responsible for everything from the letters of the gauges on the instrument panels to machine tools for pressing and cutting the aluminum for the wings.”

“So it was no real surprise that while the first B-29s were ordered in May 1941, and Wichita was up and ready to start making them in August 1942, it was almost a year after that before the first plane came off the assembly line.”

“As one wag put it, the B-29 turned out to have “more bugs than the Entomology Department at the Smithsonian Museum.”

“By the fall of 1944, its 28,000 workers had made producing B-29s so routine that Bell was able to renegotiate its contract at a lower cost-per-plane basis, and even Cover’s tragic death in a plane crash did nothing to break the factory’s stride.15 By the time the war ended, the Bell-Marietta airplane factory, once a symbol of government inefficiency and corporate waste, had become a symbol of the New South. Its new general manager became so popular he was nominated for governor in 1946, and the plant remained a pillar of the Sun Belt industrial resurgence down to the 1990s.”

“The problems weren’t just engineering ones. The R-3350 required more than nine thousand separate machine cutting tools to make. It was the most complex piece of machinery ever mass-produced in the United States, but it had to be made by one of the country’s most inexperienced workforces.22 Most of the three thousand employees at Woodridge had never worked in a factory before. They were completely unprepared for the scale and complexity of the R-3350, as were their supervisors. And when Wright instituted an intensive training program on the engine, some employees learned enough to quit and get higher-paying jobs at aircraft plants elsewhere. No wonder three of the inspection supervisors in the Woodridge crankcase and housing departments wound up leaving for psychiatric treatment.23”

“the key to making the operation more efficient was not just better handling of employees, but better use of subcontractors. Starting in September 1943, Wright-Woodridge and Dodge-Chicago began exchanging those parts each was producing more efficiently, in order to speed up output.”
</p>

“Perhaps the most dramatic success story, however, had been the Dodge Chicago plant. There had been no organizational flow charts, no elaborate management plans. Managers, executives, inspectors, foremen, and workers had simply tackled the problems as they came up and solved them. Everything had been done on a “making do” basis, and it had worked.<br>
The result, Knudsen had to admit, had been “outstanding.” He was inclined to agree with the Bechtel-McCone employee who said, “This country seems to be able to do more by accident than any other country can do on purpose.”

“Production of civilian products had resumed in August 1944—a sure sign that Washington felt it was safe to begin to wind down mobilization. “Reconversion” became the catchphrase of the day.”

“America had done all this while remaining the least mobilized of the Second World War combatants. The smallest percentage of the male population entered the armed forces. Compared to the Soviet Union or Great Britain, more women remained at home rather than going to work—more than 60 percent. And the United States converted the least of all its economic output to the war effort, just over 47 percent in 1944 compared to almost 60 percent for Britain and more for Germany and the Soviet Union, only to outproduce everyone else put together, including Japan.5<br>
Yet the output of consumer goods was larger every war year than it had been in 1939, despite the restrictions and rationing. In 1945 Americans ate more meat, bought more shoes and gasoline, and used more electricity than they had before Hitler invaded France. The dream of an economy vibrant enough to produce both guns and butter had been realized thanks to American business.6”

“Total economic production in the United States had doubled;* wages rose by 70 percent. American workers were twice as productive as their German counterparts, and four times more productive than the Japanese. Later critics would point out that those numbers were no different before the war than they had been during it.8 But that was the point. What made America productive wasn’t the war or government dictates or a supreme sense of national urgency. It was the miracle of mass production, which, once turned loose, could overcome any obstacle or difficulty.”

“Washington became worried again. A report released by Senator James Mead of New York predicted massive unemployment and inflation in the war’s aftermath, as America’s fighting men would be returning to empty factories and empty store shelves. “There should be no mincing of words” with the American people, the new head of the Office of War Mobilization and Reconversion, John Snyder, warned President Truman. The end of war production would mean the end of prosperity, and lead to eight million unemployed by the spring of 1946. Economist Leo Cherne thought that number wildly optimistic. It would be closer to 19 million, he asserted.9 And Professor Paul Samuelson, later the dean of American economists, warned that unless the government took immediate action, “there would be ushered in the greatest period of unemployment and industrial dislocation which any economy has faced”—one that would equal the Great Depression.10<br>
Others were not so sure. One was Knudsen’s old boss Alfred Sloan. As he told the American Manufacturing Association in New Jersey back in June 1944, he foresaw a postwar world filled not with gloom and the pinched faces of the unemployed, but with a bright new explosion of American growth[…]”

“The number of workers, male and female, who were killed or injured in the U.S. industries in 1942–43 exceeded the number of Americans killed or wounded in uniform, by a factor of twenty to one.”
