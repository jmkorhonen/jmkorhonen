“New Deal programs such as Social Security and unemployment insurance became staples of an expanding social welfare system. The GI Bill of Rights provided education, training, and a fresh start in life to veterans instead of merely dumping them onto a shrinking job market as happened after World War I. Unions became an enduring part of the workplace. The world of Big Business, Big Government, and Big Labor had arrived. Oh yes, and the democratic system of government was preserved from the gravest threat it had ever known.”

“Too often America’s mobilization has been portrayed as a smoothly flowing process in which patrotic Americans rose to the challenge and performed what has often been called “miracles of production.” While some of the results might seem miraculous in scope, nothing about the process was smooth or flowing. It was rather an arduous, chaotic, contentious grind that exacted a high physical and psychic toll. A curious reversal of fortune took place in that more Americans died in industrial and work-related accidents at home than in combat overseas.”
</p>

<hr>

<br>

<p>
“American mobilization took place in two distinct phases, preparedness (1939–41) and wartime (1942–45). The first proved the more crucial and did much to shape the direction, nature, and timing of the second. It was complicated by the fact that no one knew for certain whether we would go to war, when, where, or with whom. Asking the people to prepare for a war that might or might not involve us could not help but produce conflict and disagreement.”
</p>

“Myth is a powerful force and a major obstacle in trying to understand the past. Every nation’s history is glazed with myths, and America is no exception. Apart from often being incomplete or simply wrong, they get in the way of grasping what really happened. The problem is less one of forgetting the past and its meaning than of remembering the wrong things about it and drawing the wrong lessons from it. The characterization of “Greatest Generation” is a good example of a myth that, in Walter Lippmann’s phrase, is well meaning but unmeaning. Tom Brokaw and others meant well in heaping such lavish tribute on this group of Americans, but the phrase is both misleading and meaningless.”

“History never repeats itself but historical patterns do, especially those centered in human behavior. In radically changing contexts across the centuries the same range of basic emotions and responses can be seen: love and hate, generosity and greed, sacrifice and selfishness, openness and bigotry, vision and small-mindedness, commitment and indifference, hope and fear, patriotism and profiteering.”

“What the radio suggests is a world of machines for reducing human flesh to shreds and cinders . . . But worst of all, they will say, was the feeling of helplessness.<br>

“A sharp recession in 1938 had crushed hopes for recovery and delivered a devastating blow to Franklin D. Roosevelt’s fading New Deal. Unemployment hovered around 17 percent with more than 9 million people seeking work, and nothing on the horizon promised any improvement. Roosevelt entered the eighth and presumed final year of his presidency as the lamest of lame ducks. The depression would not go away despite every effort to banish it, Congress had turned against him, and the once bright hopes of the administration for continued social and economic reform seemed all but extinguished. The New Deal was played out and under increasing attack from its many enemies”
</p>

“The differences between these ambitious countries and the democracies of Europe, most notably England and France, bore little if any resemblance to the clashes leading up to World War I. A toxic element in the form of conflicting ideologies had come to infuse their thinking. While not new, never had it played so dominant and lethal a role in international relations.”

“Americans would not let go of the belief that bankers and munitions makers had dragged the nation into war. Between 1918 and April 1942 no less than 170 bills and resolutions to reduce or eliminate war production profits were introduced into Congress. To many people greed was simply one more dimension to the devil theory of war.”
</p>

“Some Americans took the practical view that Hitler was going to win and that the United States, like it or not, had to learn to do business with him. Others marveled at the technological achievements of Hitler’s Germany and thought his leadership represented the wave of the future. Their numbers included Charles A. Lindbergh, hero of the first transatlantic flight, who became the celebrity hero of the isolationist cause. Lindbergh had lived for several years in Europe and had seen firsthand the air forces of the warring powers. He was as impressed by the strength and efficiency of Germany’s Luftwaffe as he was by the weakness of England and France. He concluded logically that the democracies were no match for the regimented power of Germany, and that the United States must avoid giving them any aid while strengthening its own military”
</p>

“Intervention had little public support. A Roper poll in September 1939 showed that 30 percent of Americans wanted nothing at all to do with the warring nations. Another 37 percent were willing to sell arms to belligerents on a cash-and-carry basis but also wished to “take no sides and stay out of the war entirely.” With two thirds of the people opposed to giving aid of any kind to the Allies, Roosevelt had no illusions about the uphill struggle facing him. “It’s a terrible thing,” he told Samuel Rosenman, one of his closest advisers, “to look over your shoulder when you are trying to lead—and find no one there.” But lead he would because he believed the stakes were so high and the time short.”
</p>


<hr>

<p>
“The executive order creating the internal divisions of the Executive Office also contained a provision for establishing an Office of Emergency Management (OEM), which created a legal basis for setting up any special agency the president deemed necessary for defense, war, or any other emergency. It was a logical inclusion and, as events revealed, a crucial one that Roosevelt intended to exploit to the fullest.”
</p>


<hr>

<p>
“The longer the phony war dragged on, the bolder and more shrill grew the isolationists, who insisted that the European war was of no concern to Americans. Their opponents, the so-called interventionists, insisted that a British victory over the Nazis was crucial to American security. Both camps included in their ranks improbable mixes of strange bedfellows that ignored conventional divisions such as liberal-conservative, Democrat-Republican, Catholic-Protestant, and management-labor”
</p>


<hr>

<br>

<p>
“The interventionist camp was equally mixed, which meant that both sides disagreed among themselves on any specific issue almost as much as they did with their adversaries”
</p>

<p>
“The great argument of the last nine months—Isolation vs. Intervention—fell suddenly to unimportance,” observed Life magazine even before the fall of France. “. . . Left behind was a decade of economic experimentation, for armament on this new scale means active business and wide employment. Left behind was the coddling of labor, for the U.S. cannot afford to repeat the mistake of France in allowing its plane-building program to bog down in labor disputes. Left behind was the bitter antagonism of Business and Government, for both are now united with the same objective. Ahead lay years of gigantic effort, of heavy taxes, perhaps of a lower standard of living.”

“The legacy of World War I hung like an albatross over the nation and would not budge from its memory.<br>
The heart of that legacy lay in the War Industries Board (WIB), a body created to organize and direct the American wartime economy. Created in July 1917, it limped along with inadequate authority and direction until it was reorganized in March 1918 under the chairmanship of financier Bernard M. Baruch. Given full authority, Baruch transformed a stumbling, chaotic effort into an efficient war machine with shrewd, effective leadership. The key to his success, Baruch concluded, lay in the centralization of authority. “The great principle followed throughout the Board’s dealings with industry,” declared one appraisal of the WIB, “was that of voluntary cooperation with the big stick in the closet. The biggest problem was to increase production so as to raise the output of industry up somewhere nearer the tremendous demands of the government.”
</p>

“In 1920 Congress did pass the National Defense Act, which emphasized the importance of peacetime planning for mobilizing industry in wartime. From it flowed a series of studies and reports culminating in the Industrial Mobilization Plan (IMP), later known popularly as the M-day Plan. First published in 1931, it was revised in 1933, 1936, and 1939. Although Roosevelt gave it lip service, he found it too full of defects to take seriously and largely ignored it. Among other shortcomings, it showed little grasp of the sensitive relationship between society and the military in a major war. There also existed authority from wartime statutes for a Council of National Defense composed of six cabinet secretaries, for which the president could appoint an advisory counci”

</p>

“Roosevelt agreed but thought the public wasn’t ready, that it needed educating. Although politics still stayed his hand, he did pull off one major surprise earlier in August 1939 by appointing a War Resources Board (WRB). It marked the beginning of a new alphabet soup fully equal to the outpouring of New Deal agencies and legislation. Journalist Eliot Janeway called it “an essay in manipulation.” Most other people called it a mistake.”
</p>


<hr>

<br>

<p>
“Baruch had authored the original IMP, which among other things called for a single administrator to oversee government policy and organization on the model of the WIB. Although he indicated otherwise, Baruch had himself in mind for the position. The plan also presumed an immediate transition from peace to war and made no provision for the situation in which the United States found itself—a sort of limbo in which the country might or might not be drawn into the war. Roosevelt persuaded Baruch to revise the original plan, incorporating some of the president’s suggestions. This improved version became the report of the WRB, much of it done by Baruch’s longtime associate John Hancock”
</p>


<hr>

<br>

<p>
“The whole affair underscored a basic quandary underlying mobilization: how to organize the economy while still preserving the essential machinery of democratic government. Nazi Germany had created its military machine through brute force and harsh restrictions on its people. Roosevelt wanted none of that for Americans, but some degree of central authority was needed to get the job done. To his mind the process posed two distinct threats: militarism and domination by big business. Experience had led Roosevelt to distrust both of them for different reasons”
</p>


<hr>

<br>

<p>
“Fortified by this response, Roosevelt drove through a gray rain to appear before Congress on May 16. “These are ominous days,” he began in a solemn voice. “. . . The clear fact is that the American people must recast their thinking about national protection.” He shocked everyone by calling for the production of 50,000 planes in a year and an increase in the standing air forces of the army and navy to 50,000. At the time the industry could produce only about 15,000 planes a year tops, and the cost of 50,000 would be phenomenal. He also asked to add nearly $1.2 billion to the $1.7 billion already appropriated for military purposes. Nine days later Roosevelt, using his newly created authority, established OEM, which was to become the home base for other organizations. On May 29 he resurrected the National Defense Advisory Commission (NDAC).30”
</p>


<hr>

<br>

<p>
“The “advisers” chosen by Roosevelt showed that he had learned his lesson from the failure of the WRB. Three of the seven came from the business world: Edward Stettinius Jr., William S. Knudsen, and Ralph Budd; Chester Davis represented farm interests, and Harriet Elliott consumer protection; Sidney Hillman was a labor leader and Leon Henderson a New Deal economist.”
</p>


<hr>

<br>

<p>
“In his fireside chat that evening [May 26] Roosevelt explained to his radio audience what was needed for defense and how the money was being spent. At the same time he stressed that there must be “no breakdown or cancellation of any of the great social gains we have made in these past years.” The forty-hour workweek should remain intact and labor standards such as the minimum wage maintained, along with Social Security and unemployment insurance. There would be no new generation of war millionaires. However, at a press conference two days later he offered reassurance that “we are not going to upset, any more than we have to, a great many of the normal processes of life.” To the female reporters he quipped that “this delightful lady will not have to forego cosmetics, lipsticks, ice-cream sodas”

“the time for nudging had passed. The Dunkirk evacuation and the swift fall of France stunned people across the nation. “All of a sudden the old world, and the old pattern of thought, ceased to exist,” wrote Bruce Catton. “. . . The war was going to a decision and it was going with unbelievable speed, and the decision looked as if it would be one we could not live with.”

“The country in 1940 was altogether unprepared for the age of crisis that had begun—unprepared politically, economically, and above all emotionally . . . It was a country whose people were as unready to fight a war as its economy was to win it . . . It was a country, in short, in which the economy had not yet been mobilized for security, social or national.<br>

“Gradually Baruch made himself an encyclopedia of American industry and an indispensable source of wisdom and advice to Wilson and others in the administration. It was this growing recognition of his ability and sagacity that led to his appointment as head of the WIB.”
</p>


<hr>

<br>

<p>
“His management style was hardly that of a dictator. Secretary of War Newton D. Baker described it this way:
</p>

<p>
When [Baruch] wanted, for instance, to fix prices in an industry or to divert the capacity of an industry from one occupation to another, the way he did it was to send for the leaders of that industry, seat them around the table with him, tell them the national need, lay out the economics of the situation to them with experts in their own field at his elbow, and, at the end of the conference, they were not only informed of what was to be done but they knew why it was to be done, and they were enthusiastic for doing it.”
</p>


<hr>

<br>

<p>
“Mobilization meant rebuilding the munitions and weapons capacity that had been scrapped, but hardly any companies cared to invest in new factories that promised orders only during the short shelf life of wartime”
</p>


<hr>

<br>

<p>
“Despite energetic efforts, production floundered in a sea of problems. Orders were placed for 20,000 guns of all calibers, along with ammunition for them, yet only 133 guns and 600 shells of a single caliber reached the front in time to be used; 20 million hand grenades were ordered, but General John Pershing ended up buying grenades from the British, along with rifles and machine guns. Huge outlays went to aircraft production, but not a single American plane flew at the front. Supply purchases turned into a comedy of errors. For the military’s 86,000 horses, orders were placed for 945,000 saddles, a million horse covers, 2 million feed bags, and 2.8 million halters. During the five months and five days the Packard Motor Car Company worked on an airplane engine, it was forced to make over a thousand changes to the design.23<br>
The war effort did not stabilize until authority was centralized. General George Washington Goethals took charge of army purchasing and fixed its breakdowns”
</p>


<hr>

<br>

<p>
“When the railroad system bogged down in a hopeless traffic jam on the Eastern Seaboard, Wilson nationalized the roads. For industry as a whole the solution proved to be the WIB, which thrust Baruch to prominence and erased much of his earlier reputation as a speculator. Although the board had only vague powers, Baruch utilized them cleverly. As chairman he had ultimate authority for all decisions except the determination of prices, and all government agencies were ordered to submit their orders to the WIB. He surrounded himself with experts in each area, delegated authority freely, and dressed every order as a request for voluntary action from patriotic firms and industries.”
</p>


<hr>

<br>

<p>
“But Baruch also kept an iron fist in his velvet glove. When he presented plans to limit severely the output of automobiles, the three leading manufacturers flatly refused to comply. One automaker barked that he didn’t want any “Wall Street son of a bitch” telling him how to run his business. Baruch responded by informing the manufacturers that their supplies of coal, iron, and other key materials would be diverted to war manufacturers. Later the automaker apologized for his name-calling to George Peek, vice president of Deere Plow Co., who also worked for the WIB. “Oh hell,” Peek replied. “Everybody calls the Chief that these days.”
</p>


<hr>

<br>

<p>
“The WIB did its job by organizing, coordinating, and standardizing production. It devised a system for clearing orders to avoid duplication and took charge of allocating resources through a priorities system that, once developed, became the board’s most important instrument of control. A Division of Planning and Statistics was created to help determine the industries most suitable for conversion to war work. Congress stopped short of giving the WIB power to control prices, which made it difficult to harness the inevitable inflationary effect of wartime purchasing except indirectly through priorities and commandeering”
</p>


<hr>

<br>

<p>
“Standardization became a key instrument to increase output and save resources. The board slashed the number of steel plow models from 312 to 76, tire sizes from 287 to 9, and types of wooden coffins by 85 percent. It also took on the task of curbing nonessential construction and other use of resources despite protests from those eager to build, and began reducing the variety and output of consumer goods”
</p>


<hr>

<br>

<p>
“Although created in July 1917, WIB floundered under lack of authority and effective leadership until March 1918, when Wilson put Baruch in charge with more authority. The board achieved its impressive record in only eight months before the war’s end. Nobody knew how well it would have performed in a more prolonged conflict. In 1940 Baruch remained convinced that his model was the right one.”
</p>


<hr>

<br>

<p>
“Roosevelt could not help but feel the pressure to heed the lessons of 1917–18 and create a replica of the WIB, possibly with Baruch in charge. He agreed entirely that the defense effort needed a leader, but that leader would be himself. He welcomed Baruch’s counsel but did not trust him fully, and he trusted most businessmen even less. His greatest fear was that mobilization would end up in the hands of big business and the military, neither of which he thought was equipped to run it. Their domination would pose a grave threat to the social reforms of his administration, would curb or reverse rather than extend them. “If war does come,” he had vowed, “we will make it a New Deal war.” Yet he also realized that, like it or not, the defense effort could not do without the expertise of business executives and the military. Nor could the model of the WIB be ignored entirely.”
</p>


<hr>

<br>

<p>
“Taxes paid for only 36 percent of the cost of World War I, during which wholesale prices rose 81 percent and the cost of living 83 percent even though American involvement lasted only twenty months. Both Roosevelt and Henry Morgenthau wanted taxation to support as much of the defense effort as possible. Congress seemed reasonably agreeable and barely flinched at a tax bill totaling $656 million early in June even though it realized that more was to come. The bill raised excise taxes on gasoline, beer, automobiles, cigarettes, and movie tickets, among other items. More important, it lowered exemptions and thereby embraced nearly 2.2 million individuals who never before had to pay federal income taxes. The lack of serious opposition led Robert L. “Muley” Doughton of North Carolina, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, to explain blandly that “everybody is so patriotic.”40<br>
Roosevelt signed the bill into law on July 1. That same day he asked Congress to enact a “steeply graduated excess profits tax, to be applied to all individuals and all corporate organizations without discrimination.” The object was not only to raise revenue but also to show the public that there would be no[…]”
</p>


<hr>

<br>

<p>
“Henry Stimson, who had urged Roosevelt not to combine the excess profits bill with the other two provisions, took a more philosophical view of the mess. “If you are going to try to go to war, or to prepare for war in a capitalist country,” he observed, “you have got to let business make money out of the process or business won’t work, and there are a great many people in Congress who think that they can tax business out of all proportion and still have business men work diligently and quickly. That is not human nature.”
</p>


<hr>

<br>

<p>
“Surveying the industrial landscape, Burnham concluded that the United States, long a master of mass production, would have to start from scratch in rebuilding a munitions industry. Everywhere he looked, bottlenecks loomed on the horizon. Smokeless powder, a staple of modern warfare, seemed to be the worst bottleneck of all. In a sizable battle every soldier consumed about half a pound a day. The current output of government arsenals would barely equip an army of 100,000 men. Airplane engines were in critically short supply, as were the aircraft themselves. Hardly anyone made tanks, and the military did not have a single model suitable for modern warfare. Armor plate, especially for warships, was made only by a few mills and was difficult to produce. The shortage of machine tools and gages was hardly a secret. On and on the list went, extending to key raw materials and skilled labor as well.”
</p>


<hr>

<br>

<p>
“Less obvious but equally discouraging was the lack of what William Knudsen called the “terrible urgency of the situation.” To eliminate the bottlenecks the government and industry would have to work together, but businessmen and New Dealers had disliked and distrusted each other for several years and could not simply drop those feelings. Nor could managers and labor easily shed their mutual animosity and bitterness of recent years. In itemizing what was needed to mobilize America’s defenses, Burnham was not alone in wondering how these and other bottlenecks could possibly be overcome in a short time”

“Our danger never has been that we couldn’t do the job. It always has been that we were slow in waking up to what had to be done. Now again, that is our chief danger.<br>
—Raymond Clapper, August 26, 1940”
</p>


<hr>

<br>

<p>
“Regardless of what was built and how, everything started with machine tools. They were the cradle of production, the machines that built other machines: lathes, milling machines, automatic screw machines, precision grinders, iron planers, and other metalworking machinery. Without them no plant could turn out the thousands of parts that went into planes, tanks, rifles, field guns, trucks, shells, and every other implement of war. As the foundation of the production process, the machine-tool industry was usually the first to feel the effects of every swing in the economic climate. During the depression decade it languished as manufacturing output dropped and firms stopped ordering new equipment. Then the outbreak of war in Europe hit the industry with a sudden wave of frantic buying orders from European countries.4”
</p>


<hr>

<br>

<p>
“Machine tools made mass production possible. To build airplane engines, for example, the manufacturer sent a machine-tool company blueprints of every part of the motor he wished to mass-produce. The toolmaker informed him what machines he would need and in what order to use them, then built the necessary equipment. Ironically, this process could not be reversed. Machine tools themselves could not be mass-produced because they were so specialized and had to be custom built”
</p>


<hr>

<br>

<p>
“The number of tools needed could be staggering. Mobilization created the greatest industrial expansion in modern history, and with it an enormous demand for machine tools. Two of three war factories built by the government and operated by Studebaker, for example, each required 3,488 pieces of equipment; the third needed 13,000 machines”
</p>


<hr>

<br>

<p>
“In an average year the entire industry turned out about 25,000 tools; during the depression output sank to fewer than 7,000 a year.”
</p>


<hr>

<br>

<p>
“At the same time, the machine tools in many small plants without prime defense contracts fell silent. In December 1940 the National Association of Manufacturers surveyed 16,000 manufacturing plants and discovered that more than 400,000 machines in them stood idle an average of fourteen hours a day, and that the situation was likely to get worse as the defense program ramped up. Here was an impressive reservoir of equipment; the problem was finding the best way to tap into it.14”
</p>


<hr>

<br>

<p>
“Between September 1939 and March 1940 American manufacturers delivered 177 planes to the army and navy, 311 to Britain, and 459 to France, an average of 178 a month. In January 1940 the manufacturers managed to turn out 300 planes; to reach Roosevelt’s fantastic goal of 50,000 planes a year, 4,167 would have to be produced every month. Of the 84 American plants making planes, only 23 produced military models. “Hence the one great factor needed to make the U.S. airplane industry burgeon,” concluded Life, “is orders, orders, orders with assurance that those orders will continue at least until the cost of plant expansion is paid off, or with advance payment of expansion cost by the buyers.”
</p>


<hr>

<br>

<p>
“mass production of anything consisted of a few well-defined principles. The first step was to break the product down into as many interchangeable parts as possible. Those parts could then be manufactured in quantity and fitted together on an assembly line where the machines were arranged in proper order. If each part was uniform and each subassembly identical, every finished product would function the same way. In this process speed mattered less than accuracy at every stage. If the accuracy was there, it would create its own brand of speed.”
</p>


<hr>

<br>

“None of this was present in the aircraft industry. In 1940 building planes was strictly a boutique operation. It had only modest standardization of parts and nothing resembling mass production. A bomber, for example, contained 5,000 to 10,000 distinct parts, each of which had to be fabricated from a blueprint or specification and then put together using hundreds of thousands of rivets into a complex series of subassemblies and assemblies “to the accompaniment of the banshee din of air-riveting hammers and the high-pitched swearing of tortured souls.” The military wanted their planes yesterday, but they had to be made precisely and carefully, and the military did not hesitate to pile on design changes in midstream. Hurd Barrett, who worked at several different jobs in three aircraft factories for seven years, drew two conclusions from his experience: Americans built the world’s finest airplanes, and the manner of their building was “strictly screwball.”

“In building the Hudson, Lockheed devised a production line centered around sixteen stations where the fuselage remained for eight hours at each stop while parts were installed. If the parts were not available, the fuselage moved on to the next station anyway. The first Hudson off the line cost the company $119,100, the later ones only $63,000 because direct labor costs fell by 70 percent and overhead dropped as well. The more planes it built, the faster grew the tempo of production. Development of the P-38, scheduled to fly in the summer of 1940, followed a similar pattern.”

“Packard learned early the difference between American and British ways of making engines. The blueprints it received from Rolls-Royce were more a guideline for craftsmen than exact specifications. Expert workmen cut out the pieces and, after careful milling and machining, fitted them together into a fine engine. To mass-produce the engines, Packard had to take apart an engine, weigh and measure each piece, compare them to the original blueprints, then draw up a new set of blueprints with a precise set of specifications down to Detroit’s standard of one ten-thousandth of an inch. Once this was done, the engines could roll off an assembly line.”

“As for the merchant marine, American shipyards built not a single vessel for transoceanic trade between 1922 and 1928 even as it sold off many of the ships built for wartime use. In 1930 the Maritime Commission, which had charge of the merchant marine, still had 129 obsolete ships from the war tied up in ports at taxpayer expense. Then, in 1936, Roosevelt induced Congress to pass the Merchant Marine Act providing a subsidy to shipowners and spurring a new shipbuilding program. During the next four years forty-six ships were launched and thirty-seven put into service”

“The navy had eight shipyards of its own scattered along the nation’s three coastlines. These yards totaled nineteen ways (the structure on which ships were built and launched) and did about half of the navy’s building. Another twenty-two yards belonged to private owners and had a total of eighty-three ocean ways. Two of the private yards worked exclusively for the navy, but only three of them could build any size vessel from a trawler to a battleship. The biggest of the three, Bethlehem Shipbuilding (owned by Bethlehem Steel), was the newest and most profitable. Newport News Shipbuilding &amp; Dry Dock, the largest independent yard, had been built by rail magnate Collis P. Huntington in 1886 and turned out everything from ocean liners to aircraft carriers and battleships. New York Shipbuilding, smallest of the three with only five ways, changed hands in 1938 but had produced three battleships and the carrier Saratoga, among other vessels”

“The private yards had another thirty-seven partially dismantled ways that could be restored to use, but beyond that the only alternatives were to expand existing yards, build new ones, put back into service old ones, or work longer hours at the yards with extra shifts. During World War I yard employees averaged sixty hours a week and sometimes worked seventy hours, but a labor movement that had fought hard for years to get the forty-hour workweek would fight to retain it. As the preparedness drive intensified, so did the clash over extending the workweek even on a temporary basis”

“America possessed large quantities of two key materials, petroleum and iron ore, but it lacked adequate amounts of seventeen strategic materials: aluminum, antimony, chromium, coconut-shell char (used for gas masks), high-grade manganese, manila fiber, mica, nickel, optical glass, quartz crystal, quicksilver, quinine, rubber, silk, tin, tungsten, and wool. Some of these were easy to obtain; Canada had ample supplies of nickel and Mexico of antimony. Others could pose serious problems if the United States got into a war. Russia supplied manganese, and South Africa, New Caledonia, and the Philippines furnished chromium; rubber and tin came from British Malaya and the Dutch East Indies, and silk from Japan.”

“Stockpiling made a lot of sense. American manufacturers had long resented the violent fluctuation of rubber prices by the international cartel that controlled the market. Ridding the nation of dependence on overseas suppliers by developing a synthetic rubber industry made even more sense. Although the effort was already under way on a small scale, familiar obstacles could not be ignored. A synthetic rubber plant was a highly specialized facility requiring large quantities of alloy steel, special machinery, and skilled workmen. “To throw up huge plants now,” concluded one writer, “diverting men and materials from sorely needed aircraft, munitions, and guns, would be a major blunder.” By most estimates it would take two years to get the industry off the ground. No one knew when the emergency might come, if it came at all, or how long the war would last, and no manufacturer wanted to be stuck with large, nonsustaining plants if they were not definitely needed. Synthetic rubber products cost three to five times more to make than the natural product, especially when made in small quantities.”

“No one knew what to make of the steel situation. American firms owned about half the world’s capacity, but not all of it was directly suitable for war needs. About 90 percent of its output came from open hearth furnaces and only 2 percent from electric furnaces, which were hotter and more precisely controlled and could turn out ingots of the highest grade. Many airplane parts, components of internal combustion engines, light armor plate for tanks, and machine tools needed the greater precision of electric furnaces. Republic Steel, run by Tom Girdler, led the nation in electric furnaces but could not begin to meet the growing preparedness demand. It planned to add two new giant electric furnaces to raise its capacity by 50 percent. At the same time, Bethlehem Steel, second only to U.S. Steel in size, declared that it would also add two new electric furnaces to triple its capacity. Bethlehem also planned to increase its capacity for making heavy armor plate, as did the only other three plants that made this product”

“One kind of raw material posed the most sensitive and complex problem of all: manpower. It involved getting not only enough men for the military but also enough skilled workers for crucial industries. Beyond this obvious level it involved getting the right people—and the right number of people—in the right places. People could not be moved around like iron ore, and any plan drawn up to rationalize their use had to reckon with a host of outside influences. Politics would most certainly play a role, businesses and unions would have their say, and individuals would demand a voice in their own future. Freedom of choice was a core value of democracy, but in wartime it had to yield to national needs. The problem always was to find a balance point between them, which made democracies by their very nature less efficient than totalitarian governments.”

“Although the ranks of the unemployed still bulged with workers of all kinds, many were not in the right place with the right skills—or any skills at all. “An ironic commentary on our contemporary economic difficulties,” said one writer in July, “is that, with more than ten million unemployed, there is even now in an increasing number of fields of activity shortage of skilled labor.”

“what was needed was not a draft but a massive training program, for which there would be eager volunteers. In July the New York City Board of Education announced its desire to recruit 10,000 men with some mechanical experience to undergo ten weeks of brush-up courses for work in armament plants. On the first day 5,000 applicants showed up at the recruiting desks, many having waited in line all night; within a week the total reached nearly 20,000, 4,000 of them mechanics. These men were sent to a dozen schools that ran two separate shifts, one for those working days and one for the unemployed. Similar programs were launched in a hundred other cities with the goal of turning out 150,000 trained machinists, lathe operators, welders, aviation mechanics, electricians, and radio technicians”

“The members were to coordinate procurement and expand industrial production.

“Put another way, NDAC’s role was to translate defense appropriations into actual factory operations as quickly as possible, preferably within six months. At first only Knudsen, Stettinius, and Hillman served full-time. Although they were expected to coordinate their activities, Roosevelt appointed no one as chairperson. At the end of the first meeting Knudsen asked Roosevelt, “Who is boss?” Roosevelt replied with a laugh, “I guess I am.” The president intended to chair the weekly sessions when possible. William H.

“Knudsen’s job was to facilitate the production of munitions not usually manufactured. His division gathered or estimated military requirements, figured out how much of each kind of goods the economy could produce, and decided whether new plants or equipment were needed to produce them. It got involved in negotiating contracts, locating and building new factories, and ensuring timely delivery. In these tasks Knudsen worked more closely with the military than did the other divisions. Predictably, most of his staff came from the corporate world as dollar-a-year men who left their companies to help with the defense effort.”

“Hillman’s work was no less important or difficult. The three sections of his division had very different assignments. Labor Relations sought to keep labor peace in defense plants and avoid any interruption of production. Labor Supply and Training took on the job of increasing the supply of skilled labor, especially by promoting vocational training in state schools and within companies. The third section, Labor Requirements and Employment Standards, tried to estimate how many of which kinds of workers were needed where. It also worked to standardize wages and hours across geographic and industrial areas and to protect labor standards from erosion.”

“Although no one could know it at the time, the recommendations proved remarkably prescient in pinpointing problems that were to plague the procurement effort throughout the war. The committee wanted purchasing coordinated to avoid competition between federal agencies for both materials and finished products. To that end it asked that all federal materials requirements, present and future, be compiled in one list. Wherever the combined requirements exceeded the available supply, some system of priorities and/or allocations should be devised. The purchasing function should be assigned to whatever agency was best qualified to perform it within existing legal restraints, and any current delays in purchasing should be eliminated by corrective legislation.2”

“Even in peacetime military procurement was a complicated business. In World War I the army’s catalog of needed goods exceeded 700,000 items. By the end of 1940 the list of major components had been whittled down to 7,400 items classified into three categories: those easily obtained; those relatively easy to obtain and requiring only minor advance planning; and those difficult to obtain and needing formal planning.”

“The notion of an M-day had been a crucial part of every version of IMP. “On M-Day, the day on which this country enters a state of war,” observed a writer, “the entire military machine of the nation comes to life.” Mobilizing for an uncertain role at an unknown date against one or more possible enemies on both sides of the globe posed a whole different set of problems.”
</p>


<hr>

<br>

<p>
“These legal obstacles ranged from special interest and special purpose restrictions to procedural requirements that bound public contracts in red tape. Whatever their other merits, the restrictions slowed procurement to a crawl. Contracts also presented a challenge. During World War I each of the six existing supply branches had its own contracts, requiring a total of 400 different forms. A permanent War Contract Board, created in 1922, resolved most of the difficulties encountered during the war. Four basic contract forms were devised to meet most needs. The War Department preferred fixed-price contracts for most situations but resorted to other forms when the need arose.”

“Nelson emphasized two key approaches to the task of supplying an army that was about to mushroom in size. The first was to utilize a broad network of firms, large and small and spread across the country, in order not to clog a few companies trying to fill orders for both the military and civilians. The second was to time orders so that they reached manufacturers during their slow season.”
</p>


<hr>

<br>

<p>
“Clothing, for example, was a seasonal industry that responded well to the old trick of off-season buying. The rush to produce blankets occurred from August through October as retailers anticipated winter demand. The army needed 1.2 million blankets but couldn’t order them until the July 1 appropriation. Placing the whole order at once would have congested the mills and spurred a rise in price. Nelson persuaded the army to feed the order in gradually through the slow winter months. His staff also got the Quartermaster Corps to centralize its procurement of meat and produce and thereby eliminate middlemen. Above all, they sold the army on the concept of “distributive buying”: spreading contracts according to the availability of facilities, workforce, and materials as well as the prospect of continued production and stable prices.”
</p>


<hr>

<br>

<p>
“The army had long relied on sealed bids, a slow but reliable way of buying goods in normal times. Mobilization changed the game radically, however, through the sheer quantity and speed of its demands. Businesses rarely bought through sealed bids but used negotiated contracts. Nelson persuaded Gregory to give this method a try even though many of his officers opposed changing the familiar way of doing things. Nelson’s approach had two major advantages: It spread the business over a much larger number of firms and in the process gave hundreds of smaller companies some experience with war contracts that might prove useful later. Gregory agreed to try Nelson’s methods and was pleased with the results. Gradually they worked out a set of principles for buying soft goods that won approval from the military, the president, and Congress”

“Between June and December 1940 the military awarded over $11 billion in contracts, of which 60 percent went to only twenty corporations and 86.4 percent to a hundred companies. The finalizing of these contracts got bogged down in a quagmire of issues. Foremost among them was the dispute over the expansion of facilities to produce war goods. New plants had to be built and existing ones expanded. How was this to be done and on what basis? During its short life NDAC helped to promote $9 billion in facilities expansion, but the process proved painful.”

“Who would erect the new or expanded plant, government or private industry? How would it be financed? What would be done with it once the emergency ended? These questions alone held up negotiations for a new engine plant near Cincinnati for more than six weeks. Would the tax laws allow faster amortization of private investment? This prolonged debate delayed a deal for Packard to manufacture airplane engines and several other pending contracts. Most corporations hesitated to act until these questions were answered. As a result, large numbers of contracts dangled in limbo through the summer and early fall of 1940.”
</p>


<hr>

<br>

<p>
“Prior to the creation of NDAC, the government included in its early defense contracts the cost of facility expansion with a proviso that when the contract ended, the company would own the addition. Morgenthau and others adamantly opposed this arrangement as unfair to both the government and competing firms lacking such contracts. The government could simply build and own the plants, leasing them to private companies during the emergency, but Congress allotted only $750 million to the military for building new facilities of all kinds in the last half of 1940. This left the Roosevelt administration with two choices. It could persuade private enterprise to underwrite new facilities or it could concoct some new approach to the problem.43<br>
Few companies were eager to make the investment. Many still shuddered at their World War I experience, when the government sued them to recover funds advanced to expand their plants. They also feared being stuck with excess capacity once the emergency ended, and who knew when that would be?”

“By early 1941 the problem of cataloging brainpower had grown more intense as manufacturers began pirating each other’s technical people. Two federal agencies were compiling a National Roster of Scientific and Specialized Personnel, but it was flawed and incomplete. A group of engineers in Detroit devised a plan to compile a local inventory of brainpower by going directly to all the employers in the state with a questionnaire. Distributed through 2,200 employers, the questionnaire divided technicians into nine occupational groups and asked each respondent to list a major and minor field. It was a start but did not extend beyond Michiga”

“Later Bush wrote that “there were those who protested that the action of setting up NDRC was an end run, a grab by which a small company of scientists and engineers, acting outside established channels, got hold of the authority and money for the program of developing new weapons.

“Despite its flaws, the National Roster of Scientific and Specialized Personnel was a unique inventory of highly trained and professional practitioners in seven major categories: biological and agricultural sciences; physical sciences; engineering sciences; management and administration; social sciences; architecture and planning; and languages.

“Revere Copper &amp; Brass allocated $1.5 million for expansion of plant and equipment but stopped there. “We cannot take the business risk of going further than this,” explained its president, “because first, if we built a new plant it would not be in production for over a year, and we do not know whether at the end of that time we would have any orders for it or not; second, if we did have orders, we know in advance that profits made would be largely taken by taxes, and at the end of the emergency we might have to borrow money . . . besides having a plant which was a white elephant on our hands.”12”

“To expedite financing of new facilities, NDAC came up with the emergency plant facilities contract, while some of the more liberal staff members at RFC devised the Defense Plant Corporation. Although complicated, both arrangements helped underwrite plant expansion after a slow start. Still, the delay over amortization and excess profits stalled progress, especially on airplanes. “The reduction in . . . profit . . . has made it very difficult for the aircraft manufacturer to place subcontracts,” complained Admiral John Towers. Under its limitations subcontractors earned only about 5 percent net profit, which did not interest them. “The other and major reason, however,” added Towers, “is the lack of definite legal provisions under which they can . . . carry out this contract. They do not know where they stand.”

“Standardization posed another obstacle. Despite efforts to reduce and simplify its inventory of war materials, the army still had more than 125 different makes and models of motor vehicles. Together the two services used thirty-four different airplanes and fourteen sizes and types of guns. Standardizing and simplifying designs would not only enable mass production but also reduce the number of mechanics and parts needed. NDAC pushed the services to standardize the basic features of airplane design, simplify them, and sharply curb the number of changes that delayed production and required retooling.”

“Patterson suggested executing contracts on the basis of cost plus a fixed fee, which the manufacturers would accept. Then the aircraft companies balked over the tax and amortization uncertainties.

“Baruch also advised Stimson to get a “conspectus,” a term used by Woodrow Wilson to describe Baruch’s set of flow charts that showed the rate of production of every munition and its components compared with the original program and estimated dates. As an example he showed Stimson how to draw one up so that he could track every part of an airplane, which ones were on schedule or behind, so he would know who to hurry along. As soon as he left, Stimson summoned his aides and asked them to prepare one for him.”

“The normally reticent Knudsen also let loose with some blasts of his own. “The defense job,” he told the National Association of Manufacturers, “. . . has not been sufficiently sold to Industry and Labor as yet.” The public believed in its necessity, but not the two groups most vital to it. Plants were overflowing with defense and foreign orders but not expanding to meet them. Labor insisted on preserving its forty-hour week despite the need for longer workweeks. Knudsen railed against what he called “this blackout, this lack of production from Friday to Monday” and asked, “Isn’t it possible to put the defense job on a war basis even if we are at peace?”

I don’t say to him before that operation, ‘Neighbor, my garden hose cost me $15; you have to pay me $15 for it’ . . . I don’t want $15—I want my garden hose back after the fire is over . . . Suppose it gets smashed up—holes in it—during the fire . . . He says, ‘All right, I will replace it.’ Now, if I get a nice garden hose back, I am in pretty good shape.”68”

“Despite the criticism heaped on NDAC, it had provided an impressive beginning to the mobilization effort. During its first six months it had approved more than $10 billion in contracts, set up the first crude system of priorities to minimize bottlenecks, developed purchasing policies to hold down inflation, started worker training programs, and begun the task of stockpiling strategic raw materials. In the past two months alone a million unemployed workers had been rehired, mostly for defense production, and ghost towns where the primary industry had been long dormant were springing to life again.”

By its provisions almost anything became a defense article if the president said it was. He could order the manufacture of any defense article for use by any other country “notwithstanding the provisions of any other law.” He could sell, exchange, transfer, lease, or loan any defense article to any other country without regard to existing laws, and give technical information about defense articles to any country as well. To pay for such articles, he received what amounted to a blank-check authorization from any unappropriated funds in the treasury.

“Isolation versus intervention was not the only issue dividing the house. Far more threatening to defense production were the acrimonious splits between management and labor and those within the ranks of the labor movement. During 1941 these divisions erupted into a wave of strikes in defense industries just at the time when Roosevelt was calling for unity of effort. In most of these conflicts public opinion lined up against the unions. Strikes received wide publicity from the press, while management’s activities occurred mostly behind the scenes and seldom made news.”

“Although racked by internal conflicts, the labor movement had come into its own by 1940. The minimum wage and maximum hours imposed gradually by the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 decreed that the forty-hour workweek would become permanent by October 1940, just as mobilization was heating up. Some 700,000 workers in defense industries already worked more than forty hours but received time-and-a-half pay for overtime. The unions, anxious to protect this hard-won privilege, found themselves under siege from business and other spokesmen who insisted that the national emergency called for more hours and a six-or even seven-day week at regular pay. Labor leaders suspected with justification that many of these demands were using mobilization as a smoke screen for their desire to roll back gains made by labor during the 1930s. “The hard difficulty now,” observed the Saturday Evening Post, “is to reconcile our newly conceived national labor policy with the imperatives of an unlimited defense program.”14”

“Murray took a broader view than most of his peers. Although he made it clear that labor wanted not only jobs but a larger share of the defense-boom profits, he also understood the perils of inflation and technological unemployment. To deal with these problems he proposed the creation of industry councils for each vital industry with members from management, labor, and government. He also helped formulate Walter Reuther’s plan to speed up automobile production and made his own survey of the steel industry that claimed to show how production could be improved 30 percent without building new facilities. Even steel executives came to respect his forthright approach and ability.”

“During 1940 a total of 2,500 strikes had created 6.7 million idle labor days; in 1941 the number of strikes soared to 4,300 and the idle labor days to 23.1 million. Many of the disputes were over money. The average wage earner in 1941 made about 74 cents an hour. Auto workers averaged $1.04 an hour, tire workers almost as much, and steel workers about 95 cents. Coal miners made 99 cents but worked ten fewer hours a week than factory workers. Manufacturing workers took home an average of $1,479 a year, nearly $220 more than in 1940 but still a good distance from the $2,000 projected by standardized budgets that an average family needed to live without frills.29”

Experts disagreed on what new powers it actually gave the executive but thought it allowed him to suspend the eight-hour provision in government contracts; requisition American ships; regulate Reserve bank and foreign transactions; suspend or take over radio facilities; increase the armed forces; take over power plants, dams, and reservoirs; expand credit; regulate imports and exports; take over industrial plants; and seize transportation facilities for the movement of troops.

“OPM, like its predecessor, faced a huge task without the authority or plan of attack it needed to be successful. It was supposed to expedite production by involving itself in requirements, procurement, facilities, equipment, and raw materials, but its charge allowed it only to plan, survey, advise, coordinate, and encourage. Knudsenhillman served as policy formulators but had little more authority than they had in NDAC.11<br>
OPM featured three main divisions: Production, Priorities, and Purchasing. John Biggers, Knudsen’s second-in-command in NDAC, headed production, Nelson handled purchasing, and Stettinius oversaw priorities.”

“During 1940 the guns-and-butter mentality discouraged restrictions on the output of civilian goods even as defense production grew. As a result, shortages of materials began to appear by the winter of 1941, which put increased pressure on OPM to develop an effective system of priorities. By March four materials—aluminum, nickel, magnesium, and neoprene (a synthetic rubber)—had been placed under priorities along with machine tools.12”

“Statistical services remained a weak and controversial element in the whole mobilization process. The military utterly lacked adequate data on its needs and had no interest in developing any, preferring instead to operate as it had always done. Individual industries had data, but no government agency possessed the authority or information to create an overview of defense needs. Each of OPM’s three divisions had its own statistical staff, and the Bureau of Research and Statistics (BRS) under the capable Stacy May was moved over from NDAC to OPM to serve as clearinghouse for all the divisions. However, most businessmen regarded the BRS as a bastion of New Dealers and academics bent on stepping up defense production at the expense of civilian output. In general they were leery of any influence by fuzzy-headed statisticians, economists, and “perfessors” on policymakers, a prejudice rooted deep in their dislike of the New Deal itself.14”

“They naturally assumed that their role was to make policy decisions, which would be implemented by existing bureaus, organizations, and especially the procurement divisions of the army and navy.16<br>
This proved to be a fatal assumption because no such administrative machinery existed to handle the scale of defense production. Industrial war output grew at so explosive a rate that it deranged the functioning of the entire economy. None of the routine systems created to provide profit-and-loss accounting in private firms or to account for normal expenditures by government agencies yielded the kind of information needed by a central agency trying to determine the feasibility of military programs, their impact on the rest of the economy, how much plant expansion was needed for any given weapons program to meet future production schedules, and a host of other questions. Although the need for more and better data soon became obvious, the need for effective administrative machinery to interpret it and carry out policy decisions based on it was not yet recognized.17”

Time after time, the administrative and procedural blunders of the earlier years were reproduced in new settings.” Some people openly scorned the experience.

Priorities emerged early as a weakness in the mobilization effort, one that could shape the entire process. Until June 1940 the slack in the American economy enabled it to absorb all the demands placed on it. Then the flood of orders from both the American and foreign governments began overloading contractors, who responded by competing for raw materials and hoarding goods. “As early as midsummer 1940, we detected the loud storm signals of the priorities issue,” recalled Nelson, who was charged with studying the[…]”

“On October 21, acting on Nelson’s recommendation, Roosevelt created a Priorities Board and named Nelson as its head, with Knudsen, Stettinius, and Henderson as members. Almost at once a turf war began with the military. The ANMB had in June set up its own Priorities Committee, which was intent on gaining independent priority power. Nelson understood that priorities served three constituencies: the military, civilians, and foreign buyers. He learned quickly that hardly any military officers, in his tactful words, “realized how necessary it is to keep a civilian economy operating efficiently and in good health.”

“As the volume of requests increased, a technique used in World War I was dusted off and put into service. The first general preference order, P-1, issued on March 12, 1941, listed a variety of items as eligible for preference ratings, including electric motors, switches, steel bars, plates, forgings, and castings. Order P-2 covered machine tool parts, and P-3 airframes. Another series, beginning with M-1, aimed to conserve supplies of strategic materials such as aluminum, tungsten, and neoprene. With these orders came an enormous increase in the amount of paperwork as well as a tendency to inflate ratings, especially after the passage of Lend-Lease that same March. The most basic problem, however, was the ancient one of supply and demand; manufacturers wanted more of key raw materials than could be provided for them. The military and private manufacturers alike took to hoarding materials, which, as Eliot Janeway observed, “turned OPM’s priorities orders into so many rubber checks.”24”

“When Roosevelt issued his call for 50,000 planes, it exposed the first of two serious problems concerning aluminum. Nobody—not the aircraft makers, the military, or Alcoa—knew just how much aluminum went into any of the airplanes being manufactured. As a result, nobody knew how much was needed or had any way to measure whether existing output matched foreseeable demand. Neither the army nor the navy could come up with gross figures on what alloy or type of aluminum was required for sheet, forgings, extrusions, or tubing. Neither did anyone care to admit ignorance”
</p>

<p>
“Patterson recognized the need for expansion of aluminum output and argued that Alcoa was best suited to accomplish it. Ickes opposed giving the company a monopoly of power in the Northwest. Frank Knox found that a major cause of the shortage was the lack of workmen who knew how to process aluminum pig because Alcoa had been careful not to let its workers know all the secrets of final processing. Attempts had been made to import some aluminum workers from Switzerland, but Germany brought pressure on the Swiss government to deny passports.33”

“Steel executives were adamant in their belief that existing plants could handle any and all defense needs as well as those of the civilian economy.

“Roosevelt asked OPM to study a proposal for expanding steel production by 15 million tons, with the government financing the work through the Defense Plant Corporation (DPC). The steelmakers, in not-so-secret meetings with Jesse Jones, James Forrestal, and two OPM men, agreed to start plans for a 10-million-ton expansion, but this would take time.

“The winter of 1941 brought creeping shortages and with them a rise in prices that, coupled with growing demands for wage increases, threatened to bloom into an inflationary spiral. By spring the threat could no longer be ignored. Between May 1940 and February 1941 industrial production rose 24 percent, but the wholesale price index climbed only 3 percent. The shortages and wage demands had not yet affected the entire economy, and Roosevelt was determined to keep them at bay. On April 11 he announced the creation of yet another new agency, the Office of Price Administration and Civilian Supply (OPACS), and put Henderson at its head. The new organization combined the two NDAC units led by Henderson and Harriet Elliott. Its task was to stabilize prices, hold down the cost of living, guard against profiteering and hoarding, and protect consumers by maximizing the output of materials and goods for civilian use once the military’s needs had been met. Rising prices of key commodities had raised public concern over the possibility of inflation.52”

<hr>

<p>
“The steel manufacturers, having given their workers a wage increase of 10 cents per hour, announced that they would pass the expense on via a price increase. This posed a major inflationary threat; iron and steel products comprised nearly 12 percent of all manufactures. Within a week of his appointment Henderson slapped a price ceiling on all iron and steel products. The manufacturers cried in protest even though the industry’s profits had increased by nearly 99 percent in 1940. By August he had issued formal price ceilings for pig iron, brass and nickel scrap, hides, combed cotton yarn, and a few other textile products. Letters were sent to firms in other industries urging them to hold their prices in line voluntarily. Through these actions nearly a quarter of the wholesale price structure came under formal or informal controls”

“Walter Lippmann suggests that we ought to take over the Azores,” said Stone. “I think we ought to take over Detroit . . . We cannot fight a war with convertible coupes or overawe a Panzer division with a brigade of statistics on automobile sales. The problem is to turn existing mass-production facilities as rapidly as possible to the production of armament. We are fumbling the problem.”

“Henderson demanded a 50 percent cut in auto production; Knudsen insisted that such a move would create economic disorder. Interrupting a record production year would throw thousands of workers out of jobs while factories were converted to defense output, and who knew how long that would take? Walter Reuther of the UAW insisted that enough excess machine equipment existed in Detroit to build and equip new plants for airplane engines and frames while keeping the automobile assembly lines running. Knudsen and many others disagreed, insisting that the transition was better done gradually, thereby minimizing disruptions in both the factories and the economy.59<br>
Part of the difficulty lay in what was meant by conversion. Months earlier Knudsen had explained to Roosevelt that curbing civilian production of cars meant shutting down plants for months to install new machines and tools. Most of the toolmakers would likely scatter to other jobs such as the airplane plants, and it would be hard to get them back.”

The chaos of the scene appalled him: men crawling over fuselages, getting in each other’s way, working and shouting with no apparent rhyme or reason. The final assembly took place outside in the heat of the California sun, where temperature changes distorted the metal and required adjustments on every plane. It was, he concluded, the epitome of what mass production was not. Asked what he would do instead, Sorensen promised an answer the next morning. He took his copious notes back to his hotel room and spent the entire night dashing off piles of sketches for a layout that could turn out a bomber an hour. It was, he wrote later, “the biggest challenge of my production career . . . planning the layout for building not only something I had never put together before, but the largest and most complicated of all air transport and in numbers and at a rate never before thought possible.” From this experience later arose the most gargantuan and controversial aircraft plant of the war: Willow Run.63”

When the commission declined their offer, Reilly and Kaiser enlisted Pete Newell and Steve Bechtel, Warren’s son, and won a contract for five C-1 cargo ships.

“A typical Liberty ship had deadweight tonnage of 10,419, measured 441 feet in length, stored cargo in five holds, and carried gun turrets fore and aft. Over time an already simple design was simplified even more. Don Nelson called it the “ ‘Model T’ . . . of the seaways.” It did not cause an immediate sensation; during 1941 only seven were actually completed, five of them for the British, but the groundwork had been laid for output on a scale never before seen. The entire merchant ship program turned out 136 ships between July 1, 1940, and the end of 1941, far short of needs.”

“Like the Model T, the Liberty ship was basic to a fault, designed to be built as cheaply as possible. A host of items standard on most American vessels were omitted to save space and money. No fewer than thirty-five deviations from the Maritime Commission’s own standards for fireproofing and crew comfort were made. The crew’s lockers and rooms were made smaller; skylights and ventilator cowls had to be operated manually. The holds, engine and boiler rooms, and officers’ and crew quarters all lacked mechanical ventilation. The galley made do with oil lamps instead of electricity, and many areas of the ship used combustible instead of noncombustible materials. Several navigation aids, including a gyrocompass and radio direction finder, were left out. For crews the Liberty ship was anything but a luxury liner.31”

“The advantages of welding were enormous. A riveting operation required four men, welding only two, saving labor and reducing the chances of human error. It took five or six months to train a riveter, only two or three months for welders. Tack welding, the first phase, could even be done by beginners. A hard blow to a riveted plate often caused the holes to tear or the rivets to shear, where a welded plate merely absorbed a harmless dent. Riveting required the use of supporting angle bars, I-beams, H-bars, bulb angles, and the like, adding extra tonnage to the vessel. An all-welded ship was lighter, had more room for cargo, and could go faster on less fuel. It could also be built much faster; a welded ship could be assembled on what resembled a mass-production basis.33”

Sun’s goal was to produce seventy-two tankers in two years, a tanker every ten days. “Hell,” snorted Vickery, who had charge of merchant ship construction, “we’re not building ships.” What the commission was building for its second navy was in effect an almost complete new shipping industry parallel to the existing one, partly in new yards and partly in the expansion of existing yards.”

“The wild card in his reckoning remained the flow of materials and skilled workers. Delays in steel deliveries left some shipyards standing idle for a time, and shortages of gears, steel valves, and other parts hampered progress as well. As more new ways came online, they required more equipment that also had to scratch for steel and other raw materials. Two Morgan cranes were needed to hoist a 30-ton tanker bulkhead into place; they took eight months to build. The cost of a way ran about $500,000 with another $30,000 needed for its two cranes. Everything, it seemed, needed steel, and steel was in short supply.44”

“The original 1937 program to build 500 ships in ten years was accelerated in 1939 to five years. Then came the British order for 60 ships in December 1940 and Roosevelt’s call for 200 vessels the next month. In April 227 more ships were ordered as part of the Lend-Lease program. Before this addition was fully digested, July brought the biggest order of all: 541 more cargo ships and tankers, and 25 seagoing tugs along with 48 new ways. Altogether the programs totaled 13.5 million deadweight tons of new vessels. In addition, the commission was asked to build 25 small coasters, 25 Great Lakes ore boats, and 100 reinforced-concrete oil barges. The commission was underwriting 32 yards with 234 ways, but they would not turn out new ships until sometime in 1942. Still Land remained optimistic. In September he declared that by 1942 the United States would be turning out more tonnage than the Germans were currently sinking.43”

But only the businessmen knew how to produce things, and only the military understood what it needed for whatever assignment was handed it. The fact that the country was not actually at war complicated both ends of this equation; the military was not sure who or what it was to prepare for, and industrialists had only a general notion of what was required from them or the urgency for producing it, let alone how long the emergency might last. All sides suffered from an excessive diet of ambiguity and lack of precedent. The dilemma for Roosevelt was how to keep everyone working toward goals that were murky and on timetables that were guesstimates at best. Small wonder, then, that the course he steered seemed erratic and contradictory.”

“The June reorganization tried to eliminate some red tape by making OPM more vertical than horizontal, creating thirty commodity sections that would handle the entire process for each one. Under the existing setup all three main divisions had sections covering the same commodity, which drove manufacturers and suppliers to distraction in seeking materials and gave OPM much of its reputation as the land of red tape. John D. Biggers’s Production Division took charge of aircraft, ordnance, machine tools, shipbuilding, construction, and some industrial materials; Nelson’s Purchasing Division became responsible for areas like food, clothing, textiles, leather, and drugs, where purchasing was the chief activity. The Priorities Division under Stettinius was assigned those commodities such as tin, rubber, nickel, chromium, copper, and zinc, where importation and allocation were most important.28”

“A survey in May of over 500 defense manufacturers revealed their major obstacle to be materials shortages. Some were already under priority orders; others were headed there. For certain key materials the lines were already forming, especially for manufacturers of nonessential civilian goods. To make matters worse, a southern drought reduced the power output from TVA dams, prompting a voluntary effort to cut electricity usage by 20 to 30 percent. Southern textile mills depended heavily on TVA for power, as did plants that turned out more than half of the nation’s aluminum. The Federal Power Commission (FPC), invoking emergency authority under the 1935 Federal Power Act, ordered the immediate construction of links between TVA and power companies in seventeen states. But priorities would be required for the materials needed to build the links.2”

“Donald Nelson as SPAB director.” He wasted no time in getting the new board launched. At its first meeting on September 2 he won agreement on a statement of purpose and general policy, then started the tough task of fleshing it out.40<br>
The board had before it an imperfect set of figures for the supply of thirty-three basic commodities that revealed a large gap between projected needs and estimated supply. Two problems were obvious: Demand for most items exceeded supply, and no one had any real sense of how much of what materials were needed by the three competing constituencies, the military, civilian, and Lend-Lease.”
</p>


<hr>

<br>

<p>
“Three important decisions emanated from this first session. The board concluded that reliable data had to be assembled. It also agreed to set up an allocations system instead of one based on priorities. The difference was significant. A priorities system merely specified the order in which companies’ applications for raw materials were filled; an allocation system earmarked a specific quantity of materials for them. Finally, the board concluded that enforcement of its policies could best be done by existing agencies such as the FBI, Treasury Department, and Federal Trade Commission. Nelson saw no reason to create duplicate entities for work that was the specialty of existing agencies.42”
</p>


<hr>

<br>

<p>
“By the time the group met again a week later, the demand for aluminum, magnesium, copper, zinc, and brass had jumped sharply. The board reached a decision that Nelson regarded as “one of the most important and far-reaching actions taken in the entire pre-war defense program.” It directed him to report at the next meeting on the maximum amount of these materials and steel that could be obtained by expansion and to make recommendations on the best methods of obtaining such expansion. To Nelson it marked the first time any official government agency had decided on an all-out program. “The die was cast,” he noted happily; “all of America’s tremendous strength was to be applied to the job at hand, instead of just that portion . . . which could be spared conveniently.”4”

“Nevertheless, SPAB’s staff undertook the challenge of a systematic review of raw materials needs; it would take more than nine months to come up with a complete survey. ANMB was asked to estimate the quantities and delivery dates of raw materials needed by the military, but its initial figures proved worthless. The services literally did not know how much they needed of which items, let alone the amount of raw materials required to produce them.44”

“At the board’s first meeting Wallace made a crucial distinction between “more essential” and “less essential” production rather than “essential” or “nonessential.” Everything was needed, but choices had to be made. Giving civilian output priority was important because repair parts for everything from automobiles to farm machinery were urgently needed. This mattered greatly because, as Nelson observed, “we were not going to be able to make many new things,” so older machines had to keep working. Attention also went to major elements of agriculture, such as the dairy industry.”

“Never did the Truman Committee involve itself in military strategy or tactics.65<br>
Nor did Truman want the committee to second-guess the agencies responsible for defense programs. The committee, he said on radio, “does not seek to substitute its judgment for that of other governmental departments or agencies of defense. They have their own jobs to do. However, we can and will and do ascertain the facts about what they are doing and why they are doing it.” Another member, Joseph Ball of Minnesota, made this goal even more plain when he declared, “We decided that we did not want to make it either a smear committee or a whitewash committee.” Most of the complaints came to the committee, usually by mail but sometimes by phone or in person, from private citizens who did not like what they saw about projects going on around them or at work. At one point, the committee received a host of letters about the mysterious Manhattan Project. Truman inquired about it to Stimson, who told him it was a project racing to beat a similar one undertaken by the Germans. The first one to succeed, Stimson added, would probably win the war[…]”

“Steel was projected to fall short of needs by 8 million tons in 1941 and 27 million tons the following year, thanks in large part to the industry’s resistance to expansion. Petroleum faced a different problem. In 1940 the nation produced more than twenty times the output of all the Axis nations in Europe, but transport had become a problem because of rising demand coupled with the transfer of fifty tankers to Britain. Rubber, with its dependence on East Indies imports, was becoming an endangered species because of the war, increased consumption, and the lack of ships to bring it to American shores.5<br>
The aluminum supply remained desperate. “There is not a scrap of aluminum for civilian needs the rest of the year and next,” declared the reporter, “nor is there any aluminum for indirect military needs.” Production of magnesium had ramped up from 13 million pounds annually to 30 million pounds, with another 44 million pounds on the way.

“Government agencies played a crucial role in the new gold rush. The Bureau of Mines tended to getting ore out of the ground, while the Bureau of Metallurgy devoted its attention to the next phase, getting the metal out of the ore. The former set up headquarters in Tucson, the latter in Salt Lake City, where it built a large plant for its crew of 200 geologists, engineers, and metallurgists. Substations were set up across the West to assist both the large companies that were moving into the business and the small operators who were also growing in numbers. The RFC advanced money to anyone in either group who could show proof of sufficient ore holdings. Government metallurgists not only helped prospectors solve problems but also did experimental work on issues that were too big for private interests to tackle. It was a government experimental station that made the crucial discovery of using electrolysis to recover 95 percent of the manganese in low-grade deposits compared to only 6 to 20 percent with existing methods.”

Federal Power Commission Chairman Leland Olds predicted a shortfall of a million kilowatts by year’s end. He brought together TVA officials and executives of private power companies, who agreed to link their facilities and form a power pool covering seventeen states. Even before the drought Olds had warned that a shortage loomed because of rising defense demands. The drought succeeded in thrusting the power issue into the limelight, and with it came a political dogfight even as the FPC and southern utilities worked out a rationing system for the emergency.40”

“By 1940 the mantra that “American industry hates war” was widespread. McGraw-Hill included in all its business and industrial publications a message beginning, “Business stands against war.

War is a political tool for domination of suppression, a device of futility.” In 1940 popular writer Garet Garrett published an article entitled “War Has Lost Its Pocket,” in which he proclaimed that “American business . . . makes this original declaration—that it has neither heart nor stomach for war profits.”

Given the huge expenditures for defense, the president wanted to bump these rates up as well as impose new or increased excise taxes on a wide range of activities. Congress proved more responsive than it had in 1940, enabling the president to sign the Revenue Act of 1941 on September 20. For corporations it hiked the normal rate to 24–37 percent and the excess profits rate to 35–60 percent.9”

It will run two and a half times that much, easily.” The report also emphasized that “there were very few officers in the quartermaster corps or in the engineering corps who were at all fit to cope with the problems involved in the camp-construction program.”30”

“The construction program, whether for plants or shipyards or military facilities, competed with the production program for materials. In determining priorities decisions had to be made as to what was most needed: steel for tanks or for plants to build tanks, for ships or for the equipment to make ships. The equation also had to include a long list of civilian needs that supported the war indirectly. The nondefense plants pleading for raw materials did not make munitions, but many made products that sustained the people who made munitions. In the realm of construction, what about new housing, schools, hospitals, and other public facilities?”

“Mass production required two stages: the time-consuming process of designing, adjusting, and tooling up the assembly line, and then the actual output of the product. The first stage was as glacial as the second was speedy, which was why the mobilization process seemed so slow. Detroit got so much defense business because it understood this process better than almost anybody. But making implements of war, except for trucks and jeeps, was vastly different from an annual model change. It usually required one of two approaches: either stripping the machine tools from existing plants and replacing them with new ones or building a new plant altogether to produce the desired weapon.”

“Small businesses continued to complain that they got too small a piece of the defense pie. The army, navy, OPM, and big defense contractors still had deep pockets of resistance to subcontracting, preferring to deal with the larger, more experienced firms. The latter used many subcontractors but encountered problems of their own in the process. As an automobile manufacturer explained, he had fifty subcontractors on one deal alone, and most of them had trouble getting their necessary materials on time. The automobile company had to send its own purchasing agent out to place orders, handle shipments, and trace their movement. Every problem meant delays in the production line, and the smaller companies lacked the experience and prestige to get such things done. Some smaller firms resorted to bootlegging supplies to fulfill their contracts.48”

Truman’s committee, once established, also took a keen interest in the problem. However, as the pressure of priorities, schedules, and shortages mounted, the squeeze on smaller companies grew worse.

Odlum focused on this group and came up with a scheme that became known as “Odlum’s circus.” It consisted of three special exhibit trains, painted red, white, and blue, carrying samples of defense equipment and parts to show small manufacturers what they might make if they could.

“Small businesses did not have to await their fate stoically or depend on the government for handouts to keep them going. A select few took the initiative of moving aggressively to get contracts. When pundits wished to make this point, they raised the example of York, Pennsylvania, a town of 57,000 people, and its approach that became known as the York Plan. William S. Shipley, chairman of the York Ice Machinery Corporation, persuaded his fellow members of the Manufacturers Association to organize a Defense Program Committee in the fall of 1940. They created a local office at the Defense Contract Service and began promoting the virtues of farming out business under the motto “Do what you can with what you have.” Local companies pooled their bids for defense contracts as if they were one big firm, enabling them to go after larger contracts than would otherwise be possible. By November 1941 they had secured $130 million worth of defense business and become a model for how small businesses could survive and even flourish.53 To get that business, the committee cataloged the town’s supply of machine tools and operators, enlarged its vocational-training program, and pumped up civic enthusiasm[…]”

Part of the time went to another York firm that was making powder presses for DuPont. The survey of machines enabled such time-sharing to take place on a broad scale.55”

As a result he procured contracts for eighteen different items from both the army and navy, including not only gun mounts but the gun itself. His workforce that September of 1938 totaled 325 men; three years later it was marching toward 5,000 with a new plant about to open. Other local shops feasted as well on his orders.”

“Time was the unknown factor in the equation. Nearly every element of the defense effort had its own timetable—so many guns, tanks, planes, ships, or parts by this or that date. The timetables had to be mapped out on a blank slate because no one knew how long the war would last or if and when the United States would get drawn into it. For this reason alone it was impossible to determine whether enough of any given item was being produced, whether it was being produced fast enough, and whether it was the right item in the first place. While some people had their suspicions, only a select few within the government sensed that time was slipping away much faster than they had hoped and that the worst pressure point lay in the Pacific rather than in the European war. But nearly everyone agreed that things were not getting done fast enough.”

“We invented mass production,” declared the Saturday Evening Post. “Quantity is our principle . . . Time was only money. Now time is life, and the measure of it . . . is not fixed. It is relative and variable, because the clock is quantity.” For months the magazine hammered away at this theme of urgency still unrecognized. “Liberty is fighting for its life,” it warned in June. “If the aggressor be not destroyed, he will devour the world. America is in peril. Only by heroic and self-sacrificing exertions may we hope to save ourselves. There is no time to spare.”4”

“Time was the enemy and delay its chief agent, abetted by conflicts at every level. The army and navy fought with each other, and both battled civilian administrators. New Dealers fought with business interests and dollar-a-year men, who themselves differed over at what speed to pursue defense work. Civilians accused the army of being slower than slow to calculate what it needed and of still operating with the starvation mentality of prewar years. “In a real world,” went the argument, “the real question is how quickly can one obtain the equipment needed to give superiority?”

“A Newsweek editor concluded in September that “the nation is still a long way from being equipped to fight a war efficiently or to supply anywhere near the amount of weapons needed to lick the Nazis.” Mobilization still lacked leadership and coherent planning, a blueprint for the overall program. An overworked president insisted on keeping control in his own hands rather than appointing a single executive to oversee things. Congress bungled the draft issue, first by limiting service to one year, against the army’s advice, and then by creating a major morale problem with its reluctance to extend the term. Labor hampered production with its strikes and absenteeism, and the government’s failure to curb the output of consumer goods created severe shortages of key materials. The military compounded delays by insisting on repeated changes in the weapons being produced; the army, for example, imposed a whopping 30,000 design changes on Lockheed’s P-38 fighter between its receipt of the prototype and the start of mass production.8”

“Shortages created odd scenes of confusion. A plant making motors for the Anaconda Copper Company couldn’t finish the job because it could not get enough copper for them. A Newark manufacturer of slide zippers fasteners had to lay off more than 400 of its 1,700 workers because it could not obtain enough metal, leaving the garment trade in chaos. If slide zippers fasteners left the market, garment makers would likely not be able to get machinery to make buttonholes, which were already scarce because of a lack of silk thread. Rayon thread could not do the job, and substituting the old snap fasteners required more metal, the lack of which was the source of the original problem. None of it made any sense to the people in the plants who faced the loss of their jobs.”

“One plant that already had 40,000 workers kept hiring about 200 men a day with the goal of doubling its force. They came from all over the country, men without jobs or with jobs that didn’t pay as much compared to the promised land of the defense plants. They waited interminably for job interviews and the filling out of forms, then got assigned to crews working on some part of the giant bombers. The work was repetitive and tedious, one small step in a seemingly endless chain of steps on the road to a finished plane.13<br>
The lack of decent living conditions made the work even more intolerable. At lunchtime some 8,000 workers streamed out in search of food and respite. A few found refuge in one of the few restaurants near the plant; most made do with the beaneries or hot-dog stands outside the gates, screaming their orders and taking their dogs to a nearby curb to sit and eat. Across the street stood three credit jewelry stores waiting to take their money; aircraft workers liked to splurge on jewelry for themselves or their girl friends. Inside the plant men were constantly on edge, and fights[…]”

“In time, many of them grew listless, weary of the work and uneasy at what would happen when the emergency ended. The war was not their war, and appeals to their patriotism only made them suspicious. They were transients in an uncertain world that was changing too fast for them, loners away from home with no USO to ease their loneliness. As one observer noted, they wanted to give a damn but couldn’t find anything to give a damn about. They were not unpatriotic or cynical but simply lost in the present and uncertain about the future. To their mind they were not doing America’s work but simply holding temporary jobs in an alien place called an airplane factory.”

When asked about aid to Great Britain, 21 percent favored giving all our war materials being manufactured, while 38 percent preferred sending only half, and only 7 percent wanted none sent at all. By August more than 72 percent of those polled said that if Britain was defeated, Hitler would not be satisfied until he had conquered the Americas, and 76 percent thought the United States should back Britain and help defeat Hitler. In October 73 percent of those polled favored helping Russia beat Hitler even though they despised Communism.

“For two months during the late summer and early fall of 1941 he met with the British war cabinet and chiefs of staff to complete his tabulation of British and American resources and production potential. It was a fiendishly complex task, compounded by the tendency of each country to use different terms for the same thing. May had to devise a glossary of common terms and measurements to make sense of his figures.”
</p>


<hr>

<br>

<p>
“May’s encyclopedic volume, which he called his balance sheet, listed requirements in terms of troop units: how many tanks, small arms, artillery, ammunition, food, clothing, and other supplies were needed for so many troops of every kind. From these figures could be projected how much wool, cotton, steel, copper, and other materials would be needed to provide the supplies, and how much of every resource, material, and facility each nation had to meet these needs. What May had done was compile the first useful measuring stick for determining army and navy orders as well as overall needs. The data was priceless and would have been invaluable to Hitler if it had fallen into his hands. To get his thirty-five pounds of precious cargo home, May boarded a plane at Manchester, only to have bad weather force him to land in Dublin, then a hotbed of German spies.”

“Shortly after May’s return, a mission headed by W. Averell Harriman and William Batt went to Moscow to obtain the same kind of information from the Russians. The Russians were even more wary than the British in revealing their needs, armaments, and battlefield experience, but they provided enough data to make the effort worthwhile. An earlier mission to London in July had furnished complete schedules of airplane production for both nations and an agreement to pool patents and share secret data on planes and their performance. Among other data the British sent along drawings of their first jet engines.”
</p>


<hr>

<br>

<p>
“When combined with data from the missions, these figures provided a basis for what would be needed by September 30, 1943, if by then a sustained offensive were launched against the Axis. Put another way, it answered the question: How much have we got to make to beat the enemy? It was hardly a final answer, but at least it offered a first rational one, and it led to a second, even more difficult question: Can it be done? Finding the answer to that query fell to Bob Nathan of the Planning Division, a bright, abrasive authority on national income figures.”
</p>


<hr>

<br>

<p>
“To find an answer, Nathan had to translate the statements of requirements into raw materials, component parts, man-hours, energy, and dollars and then match them against the nation’s known resources. He also had to factor in the most critical component of all, the time factor—not only how much of what could be made but by when. This involved creating incredibly elaborate algebraic formulas that factored in all the thousands of component parts for any given weapon and the availability of the materials from which they were made. It matched what had to be done against what could be done within given time, resource, and production-level frameworks. From this complex exercise emerged figures that underlay the so-called Victory Program, which assumed an all-out production effort.”
</p>


<hr>

<br>

<p>
“Completed in late November 1941, the study was an impressive achievement. At the time existing production schedules for all defense items totaled $27 billion for 1942 and $34 billion for 1943. May and Nathan concluded that these figures could be raised to $40–45 billion for 1942 and $60–65 billion for 1943 without harming the economy or crippling crucial consumer goods and services. But it all rested on estimates and assumptions. No one in the government or the military had actually tried to formulate firm production schedules based on real wartime needs. After all, the nation was not at war. The report reached Nelson on December 4.”
</p>


<hr>

<br>

<p>
“The Victory Program was an important analytical tool but not an action program. It matched the combined war requirements of the United States and its allies against the nation’s productive capacity in a sort of grand balance sheet. What Nathan and May found was a sizable gap between existing production schedules and potential output. While they pondered the question of how to close this gap, others disputed its existence. Their work also emphasized the need for creating procedures to keep the programs up to date.”

“A second unknown, no less elusive but almost as important as time, was the nation’s morale. Polls and pundits alike tried to track it with indifferent success. “There’s a great disparity between the public attitude out around the country and the attitude of Washington officialdom,” reported Kiplinger’s in May. “Out around the country there’s much talk that Washington is hysterical, and our officials know they are so regarded, but they say they are NOT. They retort hotly that the country is ‘asleep,’ and too much ‘unaware’ and consequently ‘unprepared’ for the rigid government controls which must be imposed ‘soon.’ They say ‘business-as-usual is out,’ and they are amazed business men do not yet understand.” Roosevelt thought he knew a major reason. “The lessons of this war,” he wrote that same month, “constitute relatively such a complete change from older methods that less than 1% of our people have understood.”
</p>

“Morale has fallen off because the public has not been told enough,” declared writer Bernard DeVoto. “It has not been kept informed about developments in foreign relations or about the progress of national defense. So it has tended to believe the worst of both . . . You don’t get public support by treating the public as children.” Journalist Samuel T. Williamson found fault with the public itself. “The really bad morale is among us home folks,” he argued. “Few of us have done more than to hand a couple of worn out aluminum saucepans over to the Girl Scouts or fork out a dollar or two for the U.S.O. or do a bit of knitting or tie a bundle for Britain or roll up tin foil . . . Some of America’s half-hearted morale comes from the wish for a last fling at pleasure before more serious things start. The last drink before the bar closes . . . We Americans outside the armed forces want to wait for our miracles, and we want lollipops as usual while we wait—how we suffer when we can’t get them!”

“About $3 billion in new facilities would be needed, Knudsen added. Total cost of production, which hit $12.7 billion in 1941, he estimated at $33 billion for 1942, $44 billion for 1943, and $30 billion for 1944. Given these figures at the meeting, Roosevelt told Knudsen to go ahead with estimates for the $3 billion in new facilities; the rest would be requested portion by portion. They discussed priorities, the possibility of a seven-day workweek, curtailing civilian consumption, streamlining procurement procedures, and other issues. Stimson got the president’s approval to merge Lend-Lease into army and navy production schedules. Already Patterson had alerted the army’s supply chiefs to shift every operation into high gear: “You are directed to take all necessary steps to boost munitions manufacture to the highest possible level . . . Our production must be quickly put on a 24 hour a day basis.”

“Still another product of Arcadia was an agreement to pool all munitions and provide for a free exchange of information. Part of this effort involved creating production goals for the coming year and beyond. Parallel meetings for this purpose took place at the Mayflower Hotel between Lord Beaverbrook, Averell Harriman, and their staffs of experts. “We had all agreed that it had taken the British too many years to get full war production,” recalled Harriman, “and Hopkins had the idea, I think with Roosevelt’s full approval, that this time could be shortened if we set our sights high at once.” High they were, thanks in part to Roosevelt taking the large numbers given him and raising them even higher. When Hopkins questioned the figures, the president replied, “Oh, the production people can do it if they really try.”

“Roosevelt had asked the production people to provide their most exact estimates of raw materials, facilities, and production potential. Before their hurried efforts were completed, the president summoned Nelson to a meeting that included Churchill, Beaverbrook, Hopkins, and Knudsen. “I have been thinking about the munitions which this country must produce in order to lick the Germans and the Japs as quickly as possible,” Roosevelt said, “and by my usual rule-of-thumb method I have arrived at the following figures.” Nelson blanched at the numbers he mentioned. “These figures are high,” Roosevelt admitted, “because they represent what we simply have to produce. I have absolute confidence that the country can do the job.” When someone suggested that the figures be kept secret to prevent the enemy from learning them, Roosevelt replied, “I believe these figures will tell our enemies what they are up against.” A few days later he went public with them.”

“The original estimates called for 28,600 aircraft, 20,400 tanks, 6,300 antiaircraft guns, and 6 million deadweight tons of merchant ships. In his State of the Union address on January 6 Roosevelt stunned listeners with the figures he rolled out: 60,000 planes (45,000 combat) for 1942 and 125,000 (100,000 combat) for 1943; 45,000 tanks for 1942 and 75,000 for 1943; 20,000 antiaircraft guns for 1942 and 35,000 for 1943; 6 million deadweight tons of merchant ships for 1942 and 10 million for 1943. Shortly afterward the president raised the merchant ship totals to 9 million for 1942 and 15 million for 1943. The figures, observed Sherwood, “were so astronomic that they were greeted with derision and, in some cases, despair by military and civilian authorities alike,” even though Congress cheered them. “The President has gone in for the ‘numbers racket’!” muttered some officers in the War Department. Many blamed Hopkins and the New Dealers like Henderson for deluding Roosevelt, but the inflated figures all came from the president.”

“Two days after Pearl Harbor Roosevelt summoned Knudsen and the other members of SPAB to the White House and told them he wanted production stepped up, especially of aircraft. In particular he wanted 30,000 planes in 1942 and an increase in bomber output from 500 to 1,000 a month. Knudsen said it could be done. Then came Arcadia and the British observation that the United States, being four times larger than Great Britain, should produce four times as much. Roosevelt asked Knudsen again how many planes he could make. With new facilities, Knudsen replied, 44,600. As for tanks, he thought 20,000 with a chance of 25,000. Hearing Roosevelt’s final figures left OPM officials astounded and distraught. “I presume this is done for propaganda purposes,” said Merrill Meigs, who asked the obvious question: Where would the machine tools and raw material come from?”
</p>


<hr>

<p>
“In discussing the scope of the new board, Nelson reminded the president that earlier boards had foundered because their functions and powers had not been adequately defined. Roosevelt told him to write out the order himself and he would sign it. “I want the authority vested in you,” he added with a twinkle in his eye, “but please make the Executive Order reasonable—or, I should say, workable.” Nelson took the problem to John Lord O’Brian, who huddled with his assistant and returned with a draft that Nelson called “a model of brevity and soundness.” The key phrase authorized the chairman to “exercise the powers, authority, and discretion conferred upon him . . . in such a manner as he may determine; and his decisions shall be final.” The president did not hesitate to sign it.”
</p>


<hr>

<br>

<p>
“Whatever his feelings, Knudsen took up his new role vigorously. Beginning on February 1, he flew 55,000 miles to visit 350 plants in more than 100 cities and towns in six months. At every plant he received a warm welcome as he strolled up and down assembly lines, sometimes stopping to show a workman how to handle a tool more smoothly and sometimes rearranging an entire production line. The men loved his unassuming manner and ability to find flaws small or large that cut efficiency. In one southern shell plant he found conveyor lines running lengthwise so that when shells reached the end of one, they had to be carried by truck to the start of the next line. Knudsen revised the lines to make one start where the other one ended and told management, “Now throw your trucks out the window.” A Nash-Kelvinator plant sent him a telegram saying that propeller production had jumped by more than 50 percent. “This is a new high,” it added, “a tribute to ‘Knudsen month’ after your visit.” In such work Knudsen was at home, doing what he loved best and making an invaluable contribution.”
</p>

“The management-labor conference, meeting on December 17, agreed to avoid strikes or lockouts for the duration of the war and to settle disputes by peaceful means. For that purpose Roosevelt established the National War Labor Board (WLB) on January 12 to succeed the NDMB. Its twelve members—four each representing management, labor, and the public—had the power to impose arbitration and to adjust wage levels. Its jurisdiction extended to all nongovernment employees except railroad and agricultural workers and covered all issues subject to collective bargaining. In practice it worked closely with the Labor Department’s Conciliation Service, which adjudicated many disputes before referring them to the board. By the war’s end the new board closed 17,650 dispute cases involving 12.2 million workers and had to refer only 46 unresolved cases to the president.”

“Signed on January 30, the Emergency Price Control Act empowered Henderson’s dogged fight against inflation. As both he and Roosevelt quipped, it made an honest woman of him. Henderson could now fix maximum prices and control rents rather than merely jawbone them. He could also stimulate production of strategic raw materials by paying subsidies to domestic producers—a little-noticed provision that later assumed great importance. However, a major defect marred the act. Powerful lobbying by pressure groups removed wages and agricultural prices from Henderson’s control. Without authority over those two sectors Henderson could hardly expect to manage inflation.”

“The losses would continue until the United States tipped the balance in “our special task of production.” The enemy was very near their peak in output, while the United States had only begun to utilize its full productive capacity. For that purpose he asked three things of Americans: Do not stop work even for a single day; do not demand special gains or privileges or advantages for any one group or occupation; and willingly give up conveniences and modify routines and habits when asked to do so. Enemy propagandists described Americans as weaklings and playboys, he said, pausing for emphasis.”

“Although the reaction to the speech pleased him, Roosevelt held no illusions about how long the impact would last. In the long run only victories would win real approval, and victories depended on production.

“Nelson felt like anything but a dictator. The task before him was as clear as it was gigantic: convert the economy to a full wartime basis. The obvious starting point was the automobile industry, which was ordered on January 29 to cease all production of civilian cars and trucks. The huge amounts of steel and other strategic materials it consumed were desperately needed elsewhere, as was the industry’s enormous productive capacity. Nelson set up a WPB office in Detroit to oversee the conversion process. Ernest Kanzler, a former Ford executive, took charge of the work. The 450,000 cars in company inventories and the 250,000 still on assembly lines were not to be sold through dealers but rationed out to high-priority users such as doctors and police.”
</p>


<hr>

“By January 21 Nelson had WPB’s organization in place. The Production Division, under William Harrison of AT&amp;T, carried over from OPM its mission of working with the military to expand munitions production. The Division of Industry Operations, headed by James Knowlson of Stewart-Warner, emerged as a crucial component with three major functions. It would direct the conversion of industry to war production while maintaining adequate capacity for civilian needs, direct and control the flow of raw materials and equipment to manufacturers, and oversee all the industry branches and their advisory committees—giving them a clear point of contact with WPB. Eventually this new division centralized control over industry to an unprecedented degree.47<br>
The Materials Division under Bill Batt continued to oversee the fourteen commodity branches as it had in OPM. Leon Henderson’s Civilian Supply Division gradually lost ground as the war effort ramped up. So did Hillman’s Labor Division, thanks in large part to the growing squabble over who had authority over what sectors of manpower. Stacy May remained in charge of the Statistics Division and O’Brian of the Legal Division. The Purchasing Division was left with little of substance to do. Nelson also created a[…]”

“No illusions clouded Nelson’s view of his task. “It wasn’t up to me or to WPB to tell industry how to do its job,” he explained; “it was our function to show industry what had to be done, and then to do everything in our power to enable industry to do it . . . We had to get our nation’s tremendous productive machine harnessed . . . but we had to do it within the framework of American tradition. Merely to inflict defeat on our enemies was not enough. We had to do it in our own way.” Democracy could not use the methods of tyrants.”

“While the Purchasing Division received the most attention, Somervell created an innovative and controversial new Control Division that sought to impose business practices on supply operations. Staffed chiefly with civilian management experts, its drive for standardizing and simplifying procedures and forms resulted in the elimination of 2,900 reports and records within a year. It also improved statistical analysis, long a glaring weakness in the army, and provided Somervell with a useful management tool in the form of a monthly progress report.63”

As he explained to the Truman Committee, he had “purposely set up the War Production Board so that there are all shades of opinion in it . . . from businessmen who are conservative, businessmen who are liberal, professors, economists, public servants, people of all kinds, because this job of conversion, this job of shutting off civilian production is not an easy thing, sir, nor is it to be toyed with lightly . . . Only time will tell, and only history can record, whether we have been too slow or too rapid.”71”

”Already the shortages had begun to mount; by February petroleum, sugar, and coffee were in short supply because ships were lacking to deliver them. Half a dozen major eastern sugar refineries shut down. Land’s vice chairman, Howard Vickery, promoted to rear admiral February 12, declared that the production time of Liberty ships had been cut to 105 days, provided enough steel plate was available for them.6”

”Kaiser called Vickery one of the greatest men in America, and the first man he intended to strangle with his bare hands once the war ended. Vickery used his patented needle to perfection on Kaiser’s usually thick hide, goading him to ever shorter times for turning out Liberty ships and then using his record to taunt other builders into better performances.9”

”At first Higgins declined until Vickery cleverly posed the issue as a challenge. Never one to refuse a dare, Higgins agreed but imposed some stiff demands. The government had to furnish the capital for plant expansion, guarantee a large enough order to make an assembly-line technique worthwhile, and assure him that all necessary materials would be delivered to him on the dates specified. He needed these guarantees because he had in mind a shipyard unlike any in existence, one that when fully operational would launch a Liberty ship every day as long as production remained uninterrupted.11”

”Roosevelt’s original call for 6 million tons of shipping in 1942 had been revised to 8 million and then 9 million tons. Everybody knew these were impossible figures under the circumstances, but Land was under pressure to deliver something close to them despite the limitations of facilities, materials, and skilled labor. Already cries for his scalp had been raised by those ignorant of the obstacles facing him. “Damn it,” Land growled, “a man can’t do any more than his best.”16”
</p>

”Land’s best was far better than most. Originally asked to build 500 ships by 1947, he was now ordered to turn out 2,000 as fast as possible, not even counting tugs, barges, and tenders. Where peak output had once been a ship a week, Land’s new goals looked to produce a ship a day and hopefully three a day by year’s end.”

”The results were impressive. Richmond No. 1 turned out a Liberty ship in 111 days and looked to cut that time sharply. For the Portland-area yards Edgar laid down a schedule of 55 days from keel to launching. By contrast Bethlehem-Fairchild in March took pride in reducing its time from 270 to 150 days and aimed for 95 days.”

”Techniques of prefabrication and subassembly were known but seldom used because so few vessels had been built in recent years. The war created a unique opportunity: a demand for hundreds of ships and new yards paid for by the government. Subassembly was an innovation that came almost simultaneously to several yards. Building a complete ship in a way or basin clogged it for too long and produced indescribable confusion as workers swarmed over the hulls with each other trying to get the ship finished. The obvious solution was to build as much of the vessel as possible on dry land and then assemble the parts as if putting a huge puzzle together. The only limitation lay in the hoisting power of the cranes that lifted the final subassemblies into place. Prefabrication had another great advantage: Unlike traditional shipbuilding, it could be carried on at night within the shop.20”

”While traditional yards improvised, Kaiser’s men came up with new techniques to speed production. Aware of the cramped space of most older yards, they built yards in open, uncluttered areas to allow room for spreading out subassemblies. By using giant cranes previously seen only in construction work such as his dams, Kaiser could prefabricate larger sections. His men used welding on 90 percent of a ship and built parts of the superstructure upside down to permit downward welding rather than the slower and more tiring overhead work. Welding itself was not only faster and cheaper but less tiring as well; downward welding let gravity do some of the work. In one yard Kaiser increased speed by constructing ships in basins below water level instead of on ways. Once the ship was finished, the basin was flooded and the ship floated out into the bay.22”
</p>

”Seventeen yards worked on Liberty ships, using the same standardized parts. To avoid having them compete with 600 subcontractors, the Maritime Commission created a central purchasing pool that did all the buying and then allocated materials to the yards. Labor posed a more difficult problem. With so many new workers, the shipbuilders had to break down complicated operations into simpler components for learning. Bedford had visited a Ford plant assembly line late in 1940 and noticed that workers there learned many jobs in hours, while apprentices in eastern shipyards required weeks to master complex jobs. Although many tasks were simplified, shipfitters still needed two or three months of intensive training to understand blueprints and the fitting together of certain parts.”
</p>


<hr>

<br>

<p>
”On signal an army of waiting workers gave a shout and scrambled to the task of laying the keel in huge sections. As it took shape, the cranes lifted numbered, prefabricated sections of the ship into place to be attacked by welders and riveters. More than half the ship had been prebuilt in the subassembly plant. Ten days later the Joseph N. Teal slid into the water ready for service—two weeks faster than Kaiser’s earlier all-time record set in August and 202 days faster than the best performance in World War I”
</p>


<hr>

<br>

<p>
”Impressed by Edgar’s feat, Bedford accepted the challenge by carefully lining up men and materials to halve that time. Working eight-hour shifts around the clock, his men produced a ship in only four days, fifteen hours, and twenty-six minutes. Critics denounced both feats as cheap publicity stunts, but Henry Kaiser defended them. Bedford likened his approach to a laboratory experiment that taught his men about moving far heavier parts than usual and other technical insights. Kaiser reported that after Edgar’s ten-day accomplishment, workers came up with 250 suggestions for producing ships even faster. Bedford added that officials from other yards had come to watch his performance and learn improved methods from it. Most observers were impressed. Jerry Land observed in November that Kaiser’s prefabrication and assembly techniques had cut construction time of Liberty ships in all yards to 64.4 days, compared with 227.8 days in March.”

”During 1940 and 1941 William Francis Gibbs and his firm had done more than anyone else to organize the emergency shipbuilding program. As naval architects for the British they had drawn up the plans for Liberty ships, made all the necessary adjustments to the specifications, solved technical problems, and handled procurement from the vendors to coordinate the flow of materials. Their work embraced not only the original British order of 60 ships but later orders of 112 and 200 for the United States as well. Then, as the program swelled in size, it became clear that the government would have to assume the ordering and other functions. A dispute arose over the fee paid Gibbs &amp; Cox as the number of ships increased. When the two sides could not agree, they parted company in June 1942.”
</p>


<hr>

<br>

<p>
”Kaiser got credit for applying mass-production techniques to shipbuilding, but it was Gibbs who first attacked the problem of reducing the amount of labor that went into the work by designing parts that were easier to make and devising easier methods of fitting them together. Spreading operations over the whole shipyard meant more men could work at once on different parts rather than being crammed together in the tight interior of a ship under construction on a way.29”
</p>


<hr>

<br>

<p>
”Naval vessels did not lend themselves as easily to these techniques, but construction time there shortened impressively as well. Destroyers that once took twenty-eight months to build began sliding into the water in slightly more than eight months. A new carrier was launched a year ahead of schedule. Gibbs &amp; Cox found itself responsible for nearly 70 percent of the ships under construction. The challenge for its 2,000 employees sprawled across thirteen floors of a Manhattan building was to mass-produce plans, specifications, and purchase orders. Chief engineers and architects roamed through the rows of drafting tables urging the work on and checking its progress. Special attention went to the floor where exact scale models of each ship were built to catch any flaws in design before they infiltrated production.”

”The Kaiser yards look like something out of Disney,” reported Alistair Cooke, who was touring the country to get a sense of how the war effort was going. “They are absurdly clean and neat. The elements of a ship are divided into separate piles all the way from the administration building down to the ways. Innumerable cranes . . . clutch precisely at the piles, deposit them at the plate shop, heave them down to the ways, where small armies of Disney characters rush forth with welding guns and weld the parts into a ship as innocently as a child fits A into B on a nursery floor.”32”
</p>


<hr>

<br>

<p>
”Cooke was amazed by the simplicity of Kaiser’s methods. Construction consisted of three elements: the piles, the cranes, and the assembly bay. He counted fifty “unvarying automatic processes” between the piles and the finished ship. That the workers were not experienced shipmakers didn’t matter. Sheets of steel were “marked VK2 and MQ3, to indicate to a moron where they fit on a ship.” Cranes hoisted the sheets fifty yards to the yard floor, where a plywood template dropped down on them and thirty men traced the template onto the steel. Then another crane lifted the marked sheet to another place where drills and files cut it into the traced parts. Yet another crane carried each part off to the plate shop, where they were welded together.33<br>
“This is the precision work,” added Cooke, “and to Mr. Kaiser it is a niggling but necessary evil.” The solid work took place in the lofts, where whole forepeaks and sterns were prefabricated. At the assembly bay an entire bulkhead would be put into place and sent out onto the launching skids. To Kaiser, building a ship was not an ancient craft but simply another construction problem to be solved.”

”The United States in 1942 had nearly 133.9 million people, of whom 6.9 million were over the age of sixty-five, 3.9 million were characterized as disabled, 8.4 million were between fourteen and seventeen years old, and 30.7 million were children under fourteen. The labor force was estimated at 71.7 million, or 54 percent, not including 10.7 million mothers with children under ten. However, it did include 400,000 working mothers with children under ten, 1.3 million boys and girls under eighteen who worked or were seeking jobs, and 2.1 million people over sixty-five who either had jobs or wanted them. In the spring of 1942 some 16 million people remained unemployed for whatever reasons, and the census included a mystery group of nearly 1.8 million souls classified simply as “unknown.”5”

”The army already had 1.7 million men, and Stimson projected that it would reach 3.6 million by the year’s end. Filling the ranks marked only the first step because the rule of thumb was that each fighting man required the labor of ten other workers to supply him. Even more, it needed these workers to be in the right jobs and places at the right time. Their labors occupied two broad fields, industry and agriculture. Some jobs required little more than muscle and persistence; others demanded varying levels of skill.”

”One of the privileges of living in a free society was the right to move anywhere at any time and to better one’s lot by changing jobs. However, a nation fighting the new kind of war needed to stabilize and balance its workforce to maximize production. Inevitably competition arose for skilled labor and even for untrained workers. Companies raided the workforce of their rivals, and thousands of workers simply left one job or the farm or menial labor in search of better-paying positions. The explosion of new defense plants accelerated this process and turned normal labor markets upside down”

“As the pool of unemployed and readily available workers shrank, USES emerged as the most important agency handling labor supply. It consisted of a nationwide network of public employment offices operated by the states with federal funding. In June 1940 it had 1,500 full-time and 3,100 part-time offices with 18,000 employees, and remained at that level throughout the war even though its placement work increased greatly. The number of placements soared from 4.5 million in 1940 to more than 8 million in 1942. Since the quality of facilities and personnel varied widely from state to state, the offices were put under direct federal control after Pearl Harbor. However, efforts to strengthen the weaker ones by importing personnel from other states made only modest gains, and local officials still took their cues from state capitols rather than Washington.22”

“DeWitt continued to press for evacuation, saying, “We know that they are communicating at sea.” Actually he knew no such thing, but he also resorted to an argument that California attorney general Earl Warren advanced: The fact that not even sporadic attempts at sabotage had occurred was proof that someone was in control and orchestrating the fifth-column effort. In other words, absence of activity was proof that activity existed.40”

“During its first two terms the administration had worked hard to sell the New Deal to the American people. The coming of war in Europe and the growing defense program posed a different problem of communication: how to coordinate the flow of information from different agencies as well as the executive office. Here too World War I offered a model in the form of the Committee on Public Information (CPI) headed by newspaperman George Creel with the secretaries of State, War, and Navy as ex officio members. Under Creel’s energetic direction the CPI not only coordinated information from the various agencies but manipulated it as well, becoming the propaganda arm of the government.”

“As always, the challenge of conversion began with the automobile industry. Everyone knew what was coming; it was only a matter of when. Leon Henderson delivered the answer: The manufacture of all cars and trucks for civilians would cease on February 1. The factories would then begin full conversion to war goods. While the plants retooled, an estimated 300,000 workers would collect their newfangled $16 a week in unemployment benefits. However, no such help was available for the 44,000 car dealers and their half-million employees. Thus did the world’s largest industry, which had turned out nearly 86 million cars and trucks since 1900 and changed the face of the world, go into hibernation. No other nation had ever wiped out its major industry in wartime. Altogether the automobile industry provided jobs for more than 6.7 million people, ten times as many as any other industry.39”

“Reuther had the intellect to look beyond short-term labor gains to broader ideas of general welfare. He saw in the auto industry resistance not only to unions but also to conversion despite what he viewed as idle capacity. The plan he devised was designed to utilize that capacity as well as give labor a voice in how it was done. It had three basic elements: conversion of unused capacity—not the entire industry—to wartime production; pooling of unused equipment and manpower of the entire industry into a single organization, a sort of “Detroit Incorporated”; and a joint board composed of management, labor, and government representatives to make decisions and conduct planning. This last provision, by far the most controversial, Reuther borrowed from Phil Murray, who had a plan for industry-wide production councils composed of the same three groups. Management loathed and feared the plan because it admitted labor into the realm of decision-making that had always been reserved for those in charge of companies.42”

“Determined to avoid the Baruch plan, he rejected the idea that industry committees should be set up as agencies of government using the latter’s powers to regulate industry. When the dollar-a-year men asked how they could get around the antitrust laws, O’Brian said flatly that it couldn’t be done. In March 1941 the War Department asked that the antitrust laws be suspended for the duration; O’Brian rejected the request outright. Working closely with his good friend Bob Jackson, he formulated the policy that was to prevail throughout the war.50”
</p>

“The policy was rooted in the dictum that government delegated no powers to private agents. Industry committees would be used but would remain strictly advisory; they would make no policies, issue no orders, and have no power to police any regulations issued. The distinction between government and private interests would remain clear-cut. If government wanted concerted action from any industry, it had to get advance approval from the Justice Department in writing. No industry committee could even propose such a plan, and in return the government guaranteed its members protection from antitrust actions. Having worked out this policy with Jackson, O’Brian then created the machinery to make it work. By the end of 1941, despite grumbling and complaints, the policy was firmly established and operating. It proved to be an invaluable contribution from a man whose importance to the defense and war effort went unnoticed except by those who worked with him.51”

“In March he went on nationwide radio and called for management-labor committees to be created in all war plants to speed up production. These were not to be grievance or collective bargaining committees; their mission was limited to finding better ways of getting things done and removing bottlenecks. Nelson followed this broadcast with two more in succeeding weeks.53”
</p>


<hr>

<br>

<p>
“Here as elsewhere, it turned out that workers had something valuable to contribute besides their labor. In the process they came to realize that qualitative improvements could increase output without the dreaded speed-up techniques. The changes did not have to be drastic or threatening; in many cases they involved the smallest of details that, once corrected or improved, removed bottlenecks or eliminated other problems. And who knew those problems better than the people actually doing the work? A truck driver pointed out that more explicit hauling orders could reduce delivery times; a repairman showed how moving petcocks on heavy tanks to a more accessible position could save hours of repair time. These and other suggestions amounted to small changes that could add up to big improvements over time. However, as Nelson discovered, the biggest obstacle of all remained that of getting both sides to overcome their prejudices and give the joint committees a try.56”
</p>


<hr>

<p>
“Nelson viewed the conversion process as having three stages. First, the requirements for men, materials, and machinery for every part of the war economy, both military and civilian, had to be charted to calculate the total demand. Once WPB knew how much of what was needed, it had to determine accurately what resources were available, how much of each one could be had, what shape they were in, and how readily they could be adapted to the demands for them. Finally, the requirements had to be matched against the resources and some sort of balance struck between them. Where gaps existed, efforts had to be made to find new sources of production. If it became clear that available resources could not possibly meet the demand for them, then the requirements had to be reduced to more realistic levels. All of this was difficult enough, but since the war picture changed constantly, the productive machinery had to be flexible enough to adjust to whatever modifications were needed.59<br>
The task was not only huge but had to be accomplished on the run under the drumbeat of constant criticism from all sides. Of necessity much had to be improvised.”
</p>


<hr>

<p>
“Industry—in fact, the entire economy—shivered under the impact of conversion throughout the first six months of 1942,” Nelson recalled. “It was like nothing else the nation had ever felt or witnessed.” Designs were changing, new technologies were emerging, some of them scarcely off the drafting board, new plants had to be built and existing ones overhauled, and the clamor for key materials grew ever more incessant. There arose what Nelson called “some hysterical argument for the type of conversion which would have closed down almost every plant in the country able to produce for war.” Some came from WPB personnel who wanted civilian production halted even though it was not yet clear what the idled plants would manufacture instead.60”

“By the end of June the production of consumer durable goods had been cut 29 percent. Although critics carped that some firms and industries continued to resist conversion, the process was not easy and in many cases not even possible. Of the nation’s 184,000 manufacturing firms, some 78,400, or 43 percent, could not be used for war production and found it virtually impossible to obtain critical materials for nonessential production even at reduced outputs. The plight of these mostly small- to medium-sized plants was genuine and not easily fixed. The Office of Civilian Supply (OCS) tried to help them but lost much of its clout in the transition of agencies. In OPM it had overseen those industry branches not directly involved in war production, but it had no such control in the WPB.61<br>
Nelson sympathized deeply with these firms and recognized the need for a continued flow of civilian goods, but his primary task was to convert industry to the production of munitions. “We are now going through a period of basic economic transition,” he wrote early in 1942. “Ours is consequently the problem of converting civilian establishments to the production of war materials. It is an[…]”

“Knowlson favored a gradual approach that kept a factory and its workers intact rather than an abrupt stoppage before management could obtain war orders to replace its lost output. However, he admitted that his effort at synchronizing conversion with war contracts was not entirely successful. The most obvious and direct method of forcing conversion on a company was to deny it raw materials needed for any nonessential products, but WPB proved lax in resorting to this weapon.63<br>
In practice most conversion took place through L (limitation) orders, which banned in part or whole the production of certain items, most notably consumer goods, or M (material) orders, which limited how a scarce material could be used. Created on August 30, 1941, by OPM, the L order was used at first to reduce the output of the automobile industry, and was gradually extended to refrigerators and other products. After Pearl Harbor such orders were applied more freely and in some cases with insufficient information on the industry in question. By March 14 WPB had issued forty-eight curtailment or shutdown orders and ninety-one conservation orders curbing or prohibiting the use of critical or scarce materials. During the next three[…]”

“the automobile industry moved smartly toward full war production. Whole rows of giant machine tools sat in outside yards wrapped in brown paper or merely coated with grease, awaiting the day when they would return to making cars. Nearby vacant lots overflowed with the last new cars sitting locked until the government churned out rationing tickets for their release. “Business-as-usual in Detroit is not dead; it is forgotten,” proclaimed Newsweek in March. On every side could be seen new plants opening or going up even as existing ones pushed toward record outputs. Ford’s River Rouge spewed out airplane engines along with Packard’s big plant for Rolls-Royce engines. Chrysler’s three assembly lines bristled with tanks in the making. Hudson Motor Car’s plant at Center Line had tripled its production of antiaircraft guns and other naval ordnance since December 1.”

“Improvisation became a crucial technique in the process. Told that they could not get a machine to make a new type of universal joint, Dodge engineers altered some old passenger-car equipment and went into production in only two months. Ford engineers adopted castings in place of forgings on air-cooled airplane engines, thereby saving time, machining, and thirty-five pounds of steel among other materials. They also managed to convert a four-spindle boring machine for V-8 engines into a three-spindle unit for tank-gun mounts. At Flint, Fisher Body’s engineers built their own huge vertical boring mill in less than two months after learning they could not get one until fall, and offered to supply other tank producers as well. Across town at the Buick works, employees in a former warehouse were increasing production of plane-engine parts machined to tolerances finer than those required by watches.67”
</p>


<hr>

<br>

<p>
“By June the auto industry could report that conversion was complete and war goods of all kinds were rolling out of its factories ahead of schedule. Detroit was building 75 percent of the nation’s aircraft engines, more than half the navy’s diesel engines, more than a third of all machine guns, and nearly half of all tanks, along with thousands of motorized vehicles, weapons, parts, and accessories. One company agreed to produce shells, substituted forging for the usual tooling method, used equipment originally designed to make wheel hubs, and turned out a million shells in thirty-five days. A producer of an antiaircraft gun cut eighty days from the British production schedule for it. A parts firm devised equipment that produced machine-gun parts thirty times faster than the regular arsenal machinery could assemble them. One company boasted that it would soon handle in one day the materials it handled in thirty days a year earlier.68”

“When battle experience in North Africa showed glaring defects in riveted tanks, manufacturers moved quickly to a new, all-welded version with a revolving turret; to the surprise of many, the switch went more smoothly than the old annual model change. Nearly all military vehicles were equipped with all-wheel drive that enabled cars to climb grades of 40 to 50 percent. On a contract for a small combat vehicle, one company saved 41,000 pounds of nickel. Another developed a new solder of silver, antimony, and lead to replace the usual tin and lead. New methods of controlling carbon steels saved large quantities of alloys. More than a hundred companies were engaged in aircraft production. One of them, with fifteen contracts, announced that it was 15 to 39 percent ahead on every one of them. Some parts, once ground by hand, were grouped into special jigs and automatically ground out fourteen at a time.69”

“In the process of refining their production methods, companies often succeeded in lowering the cost of items as well. One firm devised efficiencies that reduced the price of a naval component six times from $30,000 to $20,000. Another plant used automotive-type machinery to cut the time required for a wing-panel operation by 75 percent and the cost by $1,000. Bruce Catton attributed this remarkable turnaround to “the industry having at last discovered that all but a fraction of its tools could be used to make munitions, and government having finally discovered that the way to convert the auto industry was (a) to keep the industry from making autos, and (b) hand out profitable contracts.”70”

“Give us the orders!” cried the industrialists, large and small, “and we’ll solve production.” But the problem was much more complicated than simply increasing output. The war production machine was a giant engine with an enormous number of parts that had to be synchronized to work properly. This proved to be the most fundamental task facing the WPB, and the most difficult as well.4”

“Early in 1942 feasibility emerged as the central issue confronting WPB. It involved determining the maximum demand for goods, both immediate and long-term, that mobilization could handle without becoming unstable. Until this was known, there was no way to create balanced programs, schedule production, or impose priority and allocation controls. The problem was that few businessmen even knew about the concept of feasibility, fewer still gave a damn about it, and the military ignored it almost entirely. Feasibility was an analytical tool, the brainchild of academics and statisticians who were resented by the military and most businessmen for meddling in matters where they did not belong. Acceptance of the concept, after all, would impose limits on their power to make decisions and would elevate the role of impractical outsiders. The task of figuring out maximum demand was difficult enough; getting it accepted by so many nonbelievers in positions of authority made it almost impossible.5”

“As the inevitable shortages developed, no mechanism existed to determine a hierarchy of needs.6<br>
Roosevelt aggravated the problem with his inflated production demands in January, forcing military and civilian agencies alike to scramble madly in an effort to meet them. He asked for an expenditure of $52–55 billion for munitions and construction in 1942 and $60–65 billion in 1943, staggering amounts given that total defense outlays in 1941 totaled only about $18.5 billion and the sum value of construction and goods actually delivered was only $14.7 billion. In part Roosevelt drew on SPAB’s Victory Program of December 1941, which called for spending $110–115 billion by September 1943. By contrast OPM had projected peak production goals of $27 billion for 1942 and $34 billion for 1943. For its part the ASP submitted a program calling for expenditures of $63 billion for 1942 and $110 billion in 1943, far beyond what was considered feasible for the economy to produce. Even the rosiest estimates of the economy’s ability projected shortfalls against these demands of $20 billion in 1942 and $45 billion in 1943.7”

“Nor was that the only problem. The flow of materials desperately needed better orchestration, as did the balance between military and civilian needs. As shortages mounted, bottlenecks proliferated, deranging schedules and clogging plants with unfinished goods—planes needing propellers, tanks needing guns. The priorities system helped only slightly because, among other defects, it lacked any form of quantitative control. By the time the WPB appeared, the priorities system was bankrupt, a victim of bloated categories and rankings. The scramble for raw materials took place on several levels. Military needs competed first with those of civilians and then with each other. The military’s voracious appetite prompted Leon Henderson to remark ruefully that, having fought for a year to keep a boom in civilian goods from devouring war materials, now he had to turn around and fight to save civilian goods from being wiped out.8”

“To conduct the feasibility analysis Nathan chose economist Simon Kuznets, a pioneering authority on national income who toiled in May’s Statistics Division. Kuznets had been Nathan’s mentor and boss; when Nathan took over OPM’s Bureau of Planning and Statistics he went to work for his former student. A native of Pinsk, Russia, he became the third winner of the Nobel Prize in economics. Since 1927 he had worked for the National Bureau of Economic Research except for brief periods of government service. The call from Nathan was one such assignment, and one eminently suited to Kuznets. No one knew more about the relatively new concept of national accounts and their value for taking the measure of a national economy. During the 1930s Kuznets had taken charge of a belated project by the Commerce Department to gather such data for coping with the depression. In that project a young Bob Nathan had served as one of his assistants.11”

Nathan and May alerted Nelson that immediate action was needed to curb the military’s demands. “Any attempt to attain objectives which are far out of line with what is feasible,” they warned, “will result in the construction of new plants without materials to keep them operating; vast quantities of semi-fabricated items which cannot be completed; production without adequate storage facilities; idle existing plants due to lack of materials; and similar disrupting situations”

“While the feasibility fight dragged on, a related battle developed over how to fix the broken priorities system. Nearly everyone agreed that the major bar to high production goals remained the lack of effective controls over the flow of materials. The problem grew steadily more acute as the defense program expanded and shortages of key materials began to appear. Some rational way had to be found to prioritize the process of who got how much of what. After a decade of depression in which surpluses tormented the economy, the adjustment to the reverse condition of growing scarcities proved difficult and fiendishly complex.15<br>
The quest for a system began on August 12, 1940, when the ANMB received authority to issue priority ratings on critical and essential items for all army and navy contracts. Two days later it released the first Priorities Critical List of items to which preference ratings might be assigned. From this arose the preference rating system that encountered operational problems from the start. Apart from generating a blizzard of paperwork, the system foundered as the war production program expanded. When the use of M and P (General Preference) orders proved inadequate as control instruments, OPM added[…]”

“A first step toward forging a more effective system came in May 1941 with the introduction of the Defense Supplies Rating Plan (DSRP). It streamlined the cumbersome individual preference ratings system and allowed manufacturers to apply to OPM in advance for a rating to cover supplies of scarce materials for an entire quarter. Although DSRP greatly improved the process, it could not handle the accelerating demand for so many goods and products that undermined the preference system. No machinery existed to measure the magnitude of the overall priority load, which kept expanding. By November 1941 more than 5,000 firms were operating voluntarily under DSRP, but priorities inflation had already eroded its effectiveness. An amended version of DSRP was introduced under the name of Production Requirements Plan (PRP or “Purp”), which provided a mechanism for quantitative control of both input of materials and output of finished products.17<br>
PRP had several advantages over its predecessor. It was more flexible and offered a broader range of classifications, but it remained voluntary, and a large number of manufacturers continued to work outside it as they had with DSRP. With so many firms outside PRP, WPB officials had no way to develop a[…]”

“Nelson envisioned six primary tasks for the reorganized WPB: control the flow of materials; coordinate economic and military strategy and military plans with economic possibilities; balance the whole production program; stimulate the production of raw materials and components; track production progress, assess its results, and anticipate bottlenecks; and fully utilize the potential of smaller plants.30”

“Evansville, an industrial town of 111,000 people perched on the Ohio River in southwestern Indiana, was typical in many respects. Located only seventy-five miles from the nation’s center of population, it had more than 200 factories dominated by a Big Four: Servel and Sunbeam, both of which made refrigerators, and Briggs, which produced auto bodies for the fourth member, a Plymouth assembly plant. At their peaks in 1941 Servel finished an Electrolux refrigerator every twenty-three seconds of the working day, Sunbeam turned out 1,800 Coldspot refrigerators for Sears, Roebuck every day, and forty Plymouths with Briggs bodies rolled off the Chrysler assembly line every hour.35”

“Here, as elsewhere, conversion foundered on the plethora of single-purpose machines used by the plants. Studebaker, for example, undertook to manufacture Wright airplane engines only to find that only 414 of its 3,000 machines could be adapted to the new product, and all but 64 of them were simple drill presses. In terms of layout, organization, and labor skills, large American factories were themselves huge single-purpose machines designed to turn out one special product in enormous quantities. That is one reason why so many new facilities had to be built from scratch to produce planes, tanks, and other specialized war implements.”
</p>

<p>
“When conversion threatened to throw 21,000 Evansville factory workers onto the streets in July 1941, Mayor William H. Dress led a delegation to Washington, where they spent two hours with Sidney Hillman. They returned home with Evansville as one of the first cities to be certified by OPM as “distressed,” meaning they could negotiate defense contracts at up to 15 percent over competitive prices. When this proved of little help, Dress called a meeting of more than a thousand representatives from towns in eleven midwestern states. Two OPM engineers came to town to survey its manufacturing facilities and were followed by a swarm of military engineers. The local Manufacturers and Employers Association had compiled a list of every machine tool within a fifty-mile radius of Evansville and sent it off to all the relevant agencies. In December one of Floyd Odlum’s defense trains chugged into town to display a variety of parts and goods that local manufacturers might like to make on subcontracts.”

“it standardized models by reducing their number from 200 to 20. “If a machine must be shut down to change over tools several times in a week,” he explained, “it usually requires a skilled operator and considerable supervision. If, through standardization, the same machine can run continuously on one part, it may be possible to train an unskilled operator in a few hours.”

“We have 1,200 subcontractors. To do this we had to work with the little five- ten- and twenty-five tool shops.” But 95 percent of those shops couldn’t comply with the government’s minimum financial requirements. Their owners, who often worked a machine as well, were baffled by the blizzard of priority reports and other government paperwork.<br>
To enlist their help, Herrington set up a subcontracting department, which surveyed a small shop’s tools to see what they could make and whether they could do accurate work. If so, Herrington supplied them with materials and operating sheets to show how to do the job required, then inspected the finished product to see if they matched specifications. If they passed, Herrington bought the goods. On one point he remained adamant. “The responsibility for spreading work to the little outside shops is not that of the army or navy or WPB,” he said. “It is our responsibility.”

“Through the sweltering summer the Planning Committee continued to revise the proposed production figures for 1942 and 1943. Earlier the president had reluctantly agreed to recast the figures to $45 billion for 1942 and $75 billion for 1943 by whittling down the army’s ordnance and munitions requirements. At Nathan’s suggestion Nelson set up a Committee on Feasibility, which called for a complete feasibility report. While Simon Kuznets worked on the report, Nathan made the political rounds, impressing on a variety of influential people the importance of getting feasibility right. His intense, engaging manner won some converts, giving him hope for more support in the next round of the struggle.”
</p>


<hr>

<p>
“Four days later Kuznets handed the Planning Committee a lengthy feasibility report that estimated 1942 output would fall $15 billion short of the revised $60 billion goal. He proved to be close; actual production totaled $44 billion. His main focus was on the figures for 1943, which had climbed to $93 billion. Kuznets estimated this amount as too high by 20 percent, calculating real output as no more than $75 billion. Another $18 billion was projected for nonmunitions spending such as pay and food, and $4 billion for 1942 shortfalls, swelling the total to $115 billion. This would require monthly expenditures of nearly $9.6 billion by the end of 1943, or about 75 percent of all national product, compared to 27 percent in the first half of 1942. Nathan doubted whether any economy could devote more than half its output to war production, let alone 75 percent. Kuznets reiterated his warning that the military’s production objectives were so huge that attempts to realize them would result in fewer rather than more finished products.37”
</p>


<hr>

<br>

<p>
“The inflated goal of $115 billion might be obtainable, Kuznets added, if some system existed of scheduling and production controls that allowed sensitive adjustments in the flow of materials, components, and end products, but no such system had yet been devised. As the Planning Committee told Nelson in September, “We do not now have a program with reference to whose scope, contents and levels of urgency there is complete agreement.” Without such a program in place, the only choice was whether or not to cut the estimates. Nathan urged WPB to reduce the projections to more feasible levels. An inflated figure, he argued, might provide incentives but also had a host of disadvantages, which he outlined. What was needed, he stressed, was a mechanism for integrating the three key areas currently treated separately: production factors, military strategy, and social policy. To that end Nathan urged creation of a supreme war production council with complete authority over all the agencies, including the military.38”

“Henry Wallace pointed out that the war program Somervell envisioned would require cuts in output for civilians to a level 40 percent below that of the depression year of 1932. Civilians were asked to sacrifice for a military budget that, in his view, was “larded with fat.” Others criticized the military’s program, releasing frustrations that had long been mounting, but Somervell would make no concessions to the Planning Committee’s findings. As the meeting neared its end with no decision in sight, Henderson could stand it no longer. He was the only one in the room whose pugnacity rivaled that of Somervell. “Maybe if we can’t wage a war on 90 billion,” he said abruptly, “we ought to get rid of our present Joint Chiefs and find some who can.”
</p>

“The WPB position, that production objectives ought not to be far in front of estimated maximum production, is believed to be sound as a general rule. Otherwise our scheduling of production cannot represent reality, and it is generally agreed that without realistic scheduling we will continue to suffer from maldistribution of materials, thus cutting down the actual output of finished weapons.”

“The mood at WPB and within the military was no less somber. At the end of August, eight months into the year, the production of munitions totaled less than half the amount forecast for the year. Production was still advancing but at a slower rate. When the shortage of raw materials grew worse in July, Stimson asked Patterson, McCloy, Somervell, and Knudsen for an explanation and did not like what he heard. “The real trouble is that Nelson has not got an efficient organization,” he wrote privately. “He is not taking the steps which the War Department thinks should be taken to allocate raw materials so as to minimize shortages. The time has come when this must be done. Nelson has a lot of weak men around him, none of whom is competent to face and handle this vital problem of allocation, particularly between war activities and civilian activities. The difficulty is enhanced by the fact that Nelson has a big reputation which thus apparently is fictitious.” Forrestal gave Stimson the same message on behalf of the navy.47”

Rumors of the impending attack have been going the rounds for more than a month. Last week the charges began to break into print in increasing volume.” It was, Robey added, a repeat of the campaign against Knudsen with the same complaints: Nelson couldn’t get anything done, was short-sighted, was unwilling to force recalcitrant businessmen into line, and failed to create an efficient organization. Robey offered a vigorous defense of Nelson, citing the political and other obstacles in his path. “The amazing thing,” he concluded, “is not that Nelson has not done better but that he has been able to do as well as he has.” Raymond Moley also rose to Nelson’s defense, observing that “there never will be exactly enough raw materials at exactly the right places. If raw materials piled up, it would be a sign that production is lagging.”49”

“On September 17, the same day that Roosevelt left on his tour, he issued an executive order giving Nelson full authority over the nation’s rubber program and authorizing him to appoint a rubber director who would serve under him. Pearl Harbor confirmed the worst fears about the rubber supply; the Japanese conquest of Singapore and the Dutch East Indies cut off 95 percent of it. By July 1, 1942, the nation had only 578,000 long tons on hand; projections indicated that the supply would be exhausted by mid-1943 at the latest. The country would have to depend on synthetic rubber, but that program, after long delays, was bogged down in a maze of contradictory stories, rumors, and warnings. Having failed to give synthetic production his support earlier, Roosevelt compounded the crisis by failing to grasp its gravity for most of 1942.11<br>
Before its demise SPAB created a rubber allocations committee that issued guidelines for parceling out rubber to make the existing supply last until March 1943. Once installed as chief of WPB, Nelson made rubber a top priority.”

“Newhall collected enough data to make some startling predictions. Between April 1, 1942, and December 1, 1943, the Allies altogether would have an estimated 1.1 million tons of crude and synthetic rubber. Of that amount the United States would get 736,000 tons, of which the army and navy alone needed a bare minimum of 734,000 tons. Essential civilian needs, not including any allowance for passenger car tires, came to 226,000 tons, making a net shortfall of 224,000 tons. A vigorous scrap rubber program could reduce but not cover this deficit, and more tires would most certainly be needed.12<br>
“No material in the entire category of stringent materials is more critical than rubber,” warned the ANMB’s Eberstadt on February 16. Clearly the long-delayed synthetic rubber program had to be pushed as vigorously as possible. Bill Batt of WPB’s Materials Division gave quick approval to construction materials for building synthetic plants.”
</p>


<hr>

<br>

<p>
“Newhall urged that the program raise its production goal from 300,000 to 350,000 tons for 1943 and its total capacity of new plants from 600,000 to 800,000 tons. Jesse Jones, under siege by critics for his earlier hesitations, approved the contracts needed for construction.”

“By spring the synthetic program was actually well under way, but it would take months before a meaningful supply of rubber could be turned out. In the meantime stringent conservation was needed to curtail usage and extend the life of existing supplies.13”

“Tires were by far the largest consumer of rubber, and they were about to be in very short supply. As a first step the sale of new tires was banned on December 26, 1941, and a certificate program devised to determine eligibility for purchases. On March 5, testifying before the Truman Committee, Leon Henderson brushed aside earlier reassurances from Jones and asserted bluntly that car owners would have to get along for the next three years without “a single pound of crude rubber for new tires or for recapping,” that the government might even have to requisition tires from private cars to keep essential vehicles operating, and that cabs and general utility trucks had “very little prospect of getting any more tires.” Less than three weeks later Bill Batt gave the committee much the same message. “You and I are not going to get any automobile tires for the length of this emergency,” he said, and went on to explain why. He reminded the committee of how Jones had thwarted NDAC’s efforts to get synthetic factories up and running.14”

“Normal driving continued through the winter and spring, consuming an estimated 800 pounds of rubber a day. Patterson offered a long and ruthless list of restrictions to curb this excess, such as reducing average speed from 60 to 40 miles an hour, which would increase tire life by 73 percent. The sight of Washington’s bumper-to-bumper traffic infuriated him, especially large trucks hauling what he considered nonessentials like soft drinks.”

“Nearly 95 percent of all gasoline and fuel oil used in the Northeast came up the coast; as the supply slowed to a trickle severe shortages loomed.16<br>
The connection between the two problems was obvious: a shortage of gasoline meant less driving, which would save tire wear. Since gasoline would have to be rationed, it seemed logical to attack both issues there. On April 22 Henderson announced that rationing would begin on May 15. Two days later he told WPB that rationing gas was the best way to conserve tires. A short time later an anonymous WPB official let slip that motorists in the sixteen-state northeastern region would soon have to get along on 2½ to 5 gallons a week when rationing began on May 15. The rumor touched off panicky protests and launched a parade of confusing and contradictory statements by government officials and others that thoroughly muddied the basic message. The oil industry dismissed Henderson’s plan as “half-baked, ill advised, hit or miss,” and “indicative of the lack of intelligent understanding which that government agency has shown in dealing with a problem so vital to the people.”17”
</p>


<hr>

“Henderson and Harold Ickes declared on May 9 that the allowance for nonessential motorists would be three gallons a week. Only about a third of drivers fit this category; others would get extra rations awarded by local rationing boards. Trucks, taxis, buses, and commercial vehicles were not affected, and those like doctors, police, and ambulance drivers, who depended on driving, could obtain X cards for unlimited amounts. A Brookings Institution report concluded that the time had come to transform American driving habits “quickly and severely.” A Truman Committee report countered that “there is no virtue in sacrifice for sacrifice’s sake.”

“Wholly apart from joyriding, the America of 1942 depended heavily on automobiles to get people to work. Many places, especially newly built defense and war facilities, lacked alternative public transportation, and their living conditions were so inadequate and overwhelmed by the influx of newcomers that workers had of necessity to live miles from the plant. Tires would be needed, but for a time they could only come from strict conservation measures.19”

“Meanwhile, the transportation system got increasingly snarled as Eastman tried to revamp urban traffic systems to save tires. He banned sightseeing buses and drastically curtailed charters to beaches, ballparks, and amusement centers. Another order reduced retail store deliveries by 25 percent. New York City’s milk trucks shortened their delivery schedules despite a strike threat from drivers. Cabbies in Washington, upset over a new zoning system that threatened their earnings, also threatened a walkout. The railroads and urban public transport systems alike groaned under the weight of heavily increased traffic. In Detroit the volume soared 32 percent, with buses hauling 800,000 people daily and streetcars another 500,000. The mayor of Los Angeles appealed to drivers to put four passengers in every car. Several cities went to staggered shifts to ease the traffic bottleneck.2”

“Between March and June the RRC contracted for 646,000 tons of butadiene. Of that total 526,200 tons (81 percent) would come from petroleum, 80,000 tons from alcohol, and 40,000 tons from benzene. However, the alcohol-based butadiene would be made by a company using synthetic alcohol derived from petroleum, shutting out the agricultural interests entirely. After holding hearings, Gillette concluded that Jersey Standard had used its influence to block the use of alcohol. In May the RRC increased the alcohol-based proportion to 220,000 tons (35 percent), but the farm interests were not appeased. On July 18 Gillette introduced Senate Bill 2600, which sailed through both houses in four days. The bill created a new, independent agency to oversee the production of synthetic rubber with butadiene derived from agricultural commodities and gave its work priority for materials over any other agency. Nelson called it “probably the most unwise and unwarranted piece of legislation passed by Congress during the war.”27”

“Passage of the bill finally galvanized Roosevelt to action. On August 6 he issued a ringing veto dissecting all the flaws in a bill that, he declared, would “block the progress of the war production program, and therefore of the war itself.” But he could not leave the synthetic rubber program in the air any longer. Some more positive step was needed to assure the public that progress would not be delayed. To that end he turned once again to Bernie Baruch, who in June had urged him to appoint someone of high caliber to investigate the rubber-gas rationing conundrum and submit recommendations. Two months later Roosevelt accepted the suggestion and asked Baruch to head a committee of three for that purpose”

To many people the railroads were yesterday’s industry, once the largest and most powerful in the nation but now a shrinking relic. They had an especially bitter legacy from World War I, when a colossal traffic jam on the East Coast forced President Wilson to nationalize the industry for the duration of the war. They did not return to private ownership until 1920 and then had to face more stringent government regulation and fierce new competition in the form of automobiles, trucks, and eventually airplanes as well as ships, pipelines, and barges. The prosperity of the 1920s boosted their earnings but did not solve their basic problems. Railroads were the most heavily regulated and fully unionized industry in the nation. Their managements tended to be prisoners of tradition presiding over a proud but insular, often hidebound culture that viewed outsiders and new ideas alike with suspicion.”

“By the spring of 1941 Budd and the AAR had to change their tune and admit that 100,000 more cars were needed. But manufacturers were already fighting for steel, plant space, new machinery, and high priorities, making it hard for railway car shops to fill even minimum orders. Budd was forced to admit that car orders had fallen down because of materials shortages, but the AAR continued to maintain that “there is no question of a car shortage . . . We’ll keep ahead. We don’t care how fast it [defense expansion] goes.” When ICC chairman Joseph Eastman suggested that trucks be enlisted to relieve part of the railroads’ load, the AAR bristled. The railroads, huffed a spokesman, “are still in the game of looking for more business.” Budd managed to gather a laudable set of statistics on the overall transportation picture and pushed railroads to reduce their “bad order” inventory of cars, but he did little else as the controversy over the car shortage heated up.39”

“avoid the specter of 1917. That debacle occurred when huge quantities of war goods flowed to Atlantic seaboard ports faster than ships could be provided to load them. As warehouses filled up with munitions, arriving freight cars turned into portable warehouses and piled up on sidings until virtually every major rail yard on the East Coast was clogged and nothing could move. This war was being fought on a far greater scale with numbers of men and amounts of supplies that dwarfed its predecessor.

“Early in 1942 it became clear that this would be the most expensive war in American history. Two major problems stood out even before Pearl Harbor and grew more critical after it: how to pay for the war and how to prevent a runaway inflation from wrecking the economy. No one wanted a repeat of the World War I experience in which, by Baruch’s estimate, inflation increased its cost by about 40 percent. “All wars in this country,” Henderson told a Senate committee, “have produced an inflationary period followed by a deflation which paralyzed recovery.” The collapse after World War I had been particularly severe, causing widespread business failures, farm foreclosures, and a stalled economy. Henderson warned that some $13 billion of the $67 billion already authorized for armaments and munitions as of December 1941 would be swallowed by price increases. A strong price control law, he insisted, was as essential as manpower for the military or materials for war production.”
</p>


<hr>

<br>

<p>
“Everyone agreed that inflation had to be curbed but disagreed wildly over how it should be done. Two broad approaches could be used. The government could directly impose controls over prices or it could try to curb purchasing power indirectly through broad fiscal policies such as taxation. Both approaches had their champions within the government, which led to rousing and often bitter debates over which course to follow. Morgenthau strongly favored taxation and other broad policies, as did Marriner Eccles, chairman of the Federal Reserve’s board of governors. “The job of trying to control many consumer prices by direct action is more difficult than is often supposed,” argued Eccles. “Who is to set the price of lingerie, and women’s stockings, and boys’ hats, and golf balls, and a million other items that indirectly affect the cost of living? And how are we going to distribute the products equitably once the price is set? For when you fix a price you are just at the beginning of your troubles.”5<br>
But taxation had its controversies as well. Although polls showed a willingness by Americans to pay higher taxes, deep divisions existed over who should be taxed how much. The administration[…]”

“Roosevelt first asked Congress for price control legislation on July 30, 1941, but did not get a bill to sign until January 30, 1942. The Emergency Price Control Act strengthened OPA somewhat but left Henderson unable to control wages or agricultural prices. These two political footballs thwarted every attempt to devise a coherent anti-inflation policy, partly because they occupied different centers of power. No other pressure group rivaled the power of the farm bloc in Congress, which insisted that agricultural prices be sustained at a level no lower than 110 percent of parity. On the other side, the administration sided with labor in resisting controls over wages. Henderson himself admitted to a Senate committee that “personally I have particularly tried to avoid having it in a price bill, lest it complicate an already difficult job.”

“Parity was a system devised to give select commodities the same purchasing power they enjoyed in an age of relative prosperity. The parity price for each commodity was its average during the years 1910–14, considered a good period for farm prices. The sharp fall in farm prices relative to other prices after World War I never recovered, leaving agriculture a troubled sector even during the prosperous 1920s and a disaster area during the depression years. Many farmers were hopelessly in debt, having bought more land, machinery, and livestock at the high prices prevailing during the war. New Deal programs had established parity prices for major commodities as a floor to help farmers survive. If the market price for the commodity fell below parity, which it nearly always did prior to 1940, the government bought the farmer’s crop and stored it as surplus. After 1940, however, farm prices began at last to climb above parity, creating a very different set of problems and triggering a debate over whether farm subsidies were needed at all.7”

“By March food costs had risen 4.9 percent and clothing prices 7.7 percent since Pearl Harbor. As the wage-price spiral continued its upward climb, Roosevelt asked Harold Smith of the Bureau of the Budget to oversee development of an integrated anti-inflation program.”

“We have come to the conclusion,” read the memo, “that partial programs will not work and that only a simultaneous attack on prices, rents, wages, profits, and mass purchasing power will suffice.” The group submitted a list of strong recommendations, saying that “only a program as drastic and broad as that here outlined can stop inflation. Any lesser program must fail. Such failure will be a major defeat.” More drafts of the speech followed with input from Baruch, Hopkins, Henderson, and others. Rosenman found Baruch especially helpful. “He could always be counted on for brutal frankness in criticizing speeches,” he recalled, “and for keen wisdom in suggesting ideas . . . He was shrewd and farsighted about political matters and public reaction, more so than anyone but Roosevelt.”

It called for imposing heavier taxes to keep personal income and corporate profits at a reasonable (i.e., low) level, placing price ceilings on most products and rents, rationing essential commodities, discouraging credit and installment buying while encouraging the paying off of mortgages and other debts, and purchasing war bonds instead of consumer items. On the two key areas he wavered, urging only that “we must stabilize wages and farm prices” without including any mechanism for doing so. He had accepted Morgenthau’s argument against a wage freeze and compulsory savings. Wages could be stabilized, he declared, only after the cost of living had been stabilized. The boards and agencies dealing with labor relations were invited to work out methods for stabilizing wages. Only two of the seven points required congressional action: tax legislation and elimination of the 110-percent-of-parity provision. OPA already had authority to carry out the other five points.12”

“Sam Rosenman thought that the talk “shocked a good many Americans” and that the program “was extraordinarily successful in checking inflation.” On that point he missed the mark.14<br>
Thus was born General Max.<br>
On April 28 OPA issued the General Maximum Price Regulation, which used the highest price charged by each of the nation’s 2.45 million retailers in March 1942 as a ceiling for almost every ordinary commodity. John Kenneth Galbraith called it “the most important date in the history of wartime economic policy.” General Max, as the press quickly dubbed it, was supplemented that same day by eighteen price regulations on specific commodities such as solid fuels, farm equipment, paper and paper products, and construction equipment. Another order covered 302 defense rental areas that joined 21 others already designated under the Price Control Act. The average consumer, intoned Newsweek, was “about to find totalitarian economic control has entered their democratic way of life . . .”
</p>

“Although Roosevelt had called for “a drastic reduction in our standard of living” and “rigid self-denial,” he stopped short of embracing the Baruch plan by omitting wage controls and compulsory savings. Baruch had stressed that price-freezing alone would fail unless accompanied by soaking up excess consumer purchasing power through taxes or other means. “The chief criticism of the President’s sweeping anti-inflation program, drastic though it is, is inadequacy,” concluded Newsweek. Ralph Robey was even more blunt, saying that the program fell “so far short of what is needed that it scarcely deserves to be called an anti-inflation program . . . You can’t stop a pot from boiling by putting a lid on it. You must put out the fire.”
</p>


<hr>

<br>

<p>
“General Max struggled from the start. Two days after it was issued, 700 Chicago landlords quashed hopes for voluntary rent stabilization by voting to withhold approval of rent freezes unless taxes, wages, and other costs were frozen first. New York State food merchants and others protested the March date and demanded different dates to suit their particular situation. Ten Illinois coal mines shut down, throwing 2,000 miners out of work, when operators claimed that the ceilings made it impossible to earn a profit. More than 10,000 tailors faced layoffs because manufacturers contended that they had already contracted to deliver fall clothing at April prices and could not meet expenses at their highest March prices. Grocers moaned that thousands of small food stores would go bankrupt. Shoppers found different prices for the same goods at various stores because their highest price in March had been different.18”
</p>


<hr>

<br>

<p>
“Two problems plagued efforts to control food prices. The restrictions in the Price Control Act kept several key commodities—poultry, eggs, sheep and lambs, milk and milk products, and wheat products, including flour—from price controls under General Max. A second issue involved the “squeeze” created by pegging prices to March levels. When retailers began replenishing stocks of canned goods, they found that the ceiling prices on their supplies tended to be higher than their retail price ceilings. Farm prices and labor costs rose about 10 percent during the year and transportation costs about 5 percent. No solution to this problem existed that did not involve either raising prices, removing controls (which had the same effect), or using government subsidies to cushion the squeeze.”
</p>


<hr>

<br>

<p>
“The executive branch had already concluded that more than General Max was needed to fight inflation. OPA sent Rosenman a proposal for tightening wage and farm price controls, arguing that the cost of living could not be stabilized unless all factors were subject to restraint. It urged the creation of a new board to regulate wages, but the request was rejected as unworkable. However, the idea of a new board to coordinate all stabilization efforts took wing in discussions among White House and Budget Bureau staff. A Gallup poll in August revealed that 70 percent of respondents thought every family not on relief should pay much higher taxes to support the war, while 71 percent approved the freezing of wages, salaries, and food costs. Some advisers pushed Roosevelt to act on his own without waiting for Congress, arguing that the Second War Powers Act, passed in March, gave him all the authority he needed.34”
</p>


<hr>

<br>

<p>
“One day later Roosevelt issued an executive order creating the Office of Economic Stabilization (OES) composed of eight top administration officials and two members each from labor, management, and agriculture.”
</p>


<hr>

<br>

<p>
“n the same edict the president included a number of long-awaited steps. He ordered all wages and farm prices stabilized at their levels on September 15 and extended to WLB the power to approve or cut all wages, not just those in dispute. The farm order covered about 90 percent of all foodstuffs; fresh fruits and vegetables were almost impossible to regulate. Ceilings on rent were extended beyond the original specific group to the entire country. All salaries over $5,000 were to be frozen except in exceptional circumstances, and where practicable salaries were not to exceed $25,000 a year after payment of taxes, insurance premiums, and fixed obligations already incurred.39”

“Few things posed more problems or aroused more controversy than rationing. The image of Americans cheerfully accepting the need for it and patriotically abiding by its strictures is largely a fantasy spawned by the “Greatest Generation” myth. In reality it was violated almost as much as it was obeyed, and its complexities and logistical nightmares drove officials and citizens alike to despair. While many if not most people were willing to make sacrifices for the war effort, they differed radically on what to give up and how far they were willing to go. Inevitably rationing, apart from being difficult to enforce, gave rise to “Mr. Black,” the black market operations that recalled the unsavory days of prohibition and the rise of the mobs. Americans had avoided rationing in World War I, but Roosevelt warned repeatedly that it would be needed in 1942. In the end Mr. Black trumped General Max.”
</p>


<hr>

<br>

<p>
“Rationing served two main purposes. Most obviously it tried to allocate on an equitable basis goods and materials in short supply. On another level it joined with price controls to help limit what Americans could buy at a time when they had more money in their pockets than anytime since the 1920s if ever. But a fair and effective rationing program was even more cumbersome to impose than price ceilings. The public squawked loudly over having to deal with the system, its wrath heightened by the fact that many of the items rationed were among the most important to their daily routines. To some it smacked too much of the totalitarian methods against which the war was being fought. No one wanted to fight Germany by emulating Germany.”
</p>


<hr>

<p>
“The system never worked well. An OPA survey estimated that nearly half of all Americans had B or C stickers, while a Gallup poll revealed that three fourths of the 45 percent of Americans who drove to work said they could get there some other way if necessary. Inevitably a black market sprang up for both tires and gasoline, the latter mostly in the form of counterfeit coupons. Professional criminals moved into the racket and sold the phony coupons largely to filling station operators. When a filling station did not cooperate, the mob resorted to violence. One woman in New Jersey was tortured with a burning paper torch when she refused to play ball with the counterfeiters. Truck drivers also sold their excess to filling station operators who in turn sold extra gas to favored customers without coupons.42”
</p>


<hr>

<p>
“By fall it was clear that a broader range of rationing would be needed. During 1942 OPA instituted ten major rationing programs, with more to come. Coffee joined the list, as did some canned goods and shoes, each one for a different reason. Coffee, like sugar, had ample supplies but too few ships to carry it to the United States; canned goods suffered from a shortage of tin, and military needs swallowed a giant portion of shoes. Warned that coffee would be rationed in a few weeks, housewives responded by emptying the shelves of it. OPA countered by freezing sales of coffee a week before rationing began (one pound every five weeks for every person over age fifteen) and announcing the freeze on a Sunday when stores were closed. Later it used this same approach on other commodities.46”
</p>


<hr>

<br>

<p>
“However, unlike sugar, which rich and poor alike consumed in almost the same amounts, the well-to-do ate three times as much meat as the poor. Imposing a ration of two and a half pounds per person, as Claude Wickard proposed, meant that more than half the American people would actually get more meat than they currently bought, while those with higher incomes would incur a 40 percent reduction.”
</p>


<hr>

<br>

<p>
“OPA investigated 500 eastern filling stations and found that 70 percent were bootlegging gasoline and violating rationing rules.”
</p>


<hr>

<br>

<p>
“Already easterners had put into circulation 150 million gasoline ration coupons every month, to which the nation added another 130 million sugar ration stamps. As the rationing system grew, the paperwork threatened to overwhelm it. Ration boards were set up in every county of every state, manned by more than 30,000 volunteers to process the mountain of paper. The government printed 200 million comprehensive coupon books for distribution that fall. Buying any rationed product required not only cash but the proper coupon or stamp, which had to be used within a given period of time, usually a month. The process was not only cumbersome but imposed an unprecedented degree of regimentation on Americans unaccustomed to it.53”
</p>


<hr>

<p>
“In the twelve months since Pearl Harbor,” concluded Newsweek in December, “the American family has begun to experience war on the home front.” Nearly a year had passed before people outside the East had to endure gas rationing, the sugar pinch was gentle so far, meat rationing would not begin for another month, and the effects of the fuel oil shortage remained an unknown. Although the family food bill had gone up 16 percent in a year, daily fare had hardly changed except for a limit of one cup of coffee. Thanks-giving dinner seemed as full a feast as ever, marred only by the absence of loved ones serving in the military. Travel had become an ordeal. The gas crunch limited the range of driving, and trains were jammed with soldiers as well as civilian travelers. To save fuel, the government wanted those with oil burners to switch to coal if possible and asked everyone to keep the thermostat no higher than 65 degrees. A Gallup poll revealed that 68 percent of those with oil and 72 percent of those with coal ignored the request.55”
</p>


<hr>

<p>
“The real hard truth,” predicted Newsweek, “is that Americans not only are going to have their standard of living reduced all along the line, but will have to sacrifice for the duration the traditional American way of life.” Yet how much was really being sacrificed? More Americans were earning more money and living better than they had in years. Many kinds of consumer goods could no longer be had, but enough remained to make daily life more comfortable than many people had experienced recently if at all. Looking back on these years, John Kenneth Galbraith concluded that “never in the long history of human combat have so many talked so much about sacrifice with so little deprivation as in the United States in World War II.”56”

“At home the fall elections inflicted a rare setback on Roosevelt as Republicans gained forty-four seats in the House and nine in the Senate, mostly at the expense of northern liberals. This victory strengthened the conservatives in Congress and encouraged the coalition of northern Republicans and conservative southern Democrats who found common cause in a number of issues ranging from white supremacy to cutting federal spending except on the war. Together they could make or break nearly any legislation. Southerners occupied more than half of all Democratic seats in the House and beat down every attempt at racial reform, such as repeal of the poll tax. The political landscape was undergoing a radical shift, one that made relations on the Hill more divisive than ever. Liberals saw their long-dominant influence slipping away and despaired that the war was delivering power into the hands of business and the military. Conservatives, intent on rolling back what they deemed the excesses of the New Deal, labeled any piece of legislation they disliked as an attempt at social reform disguised as a war measure.5”

“politics had taken an ugly and unpredictable turn in wartime, one that often baffled and frustrated even FDR. The dilemma that haunted his liberal supporters bothered him as well: how to win the war without losing the New Deal. The Republicans, aside from Willkie, seemed to offer nothing but negativity and righteous slogans.7”

“We have to change our way of looking at taxes during the war,” wrote Clapper in March. “A lot of people want to help the Government win the war . . . They can at least pay taxes. More than that, they can give their support to every proposal to increase taxes. They can help club down special-interest groups that will try to chisel away the heavy taxes just proposed.” Seven months later, after months of bitter and confused wrangling, Congress finally passed and Roosevelt signed the Revenue Act of 1942. One provision did away with the requirement to have returns sworn before a notary public. A Treasury official noted wryly that “the taxpayers probably will do enough swearing anyway when they add it up.”9<br>
The new law nearly doubled federal taxes and in the process transformed the American way of taxation. It increased the normal and surtax rates on all incomes, with the latter reaching a high of 82 percent on incomes above $200,000. In all, the two rates totaled 19 percent of the first $2,000 in income and increased at higher income levels. More significantly, the new act lowered personal exemptions, which had been dropping steadily since 1931[…]”
</p>


<hr>

<p>
“Another innovation caused the biggest stir. On top of their regular taxes citizens with incomes above $624 would also pay a special 5 percent Victory Tax but would receive a credit—25 percent for single people, 40 percent for couples, and another 2 percent for each dependent—that could be used as an offset in some cases on 1943 income taxes or reclaimed as a non-interest-bearing bond after the war. The Victory Tax would be withheld from individual paychecks. Corporations could reclaim 10 percent of their excess profits payments after the war as well. Under the new system income taxes became for the first time a way of life for most Americans. In 1940 about 7 percent of the population paid income taxes; by 1944 the figure would top 64 percent. The Victory Tax was an obvious attempt to curb excess consumer spending. Hardly anyone liked the new tax system, but for very different reasons.11”
</p>


<hr>

<br>

<p>
“The tremendous new tax load has a dual purpose,” said Newsweek: “to control inflation and to pay for the cost of the war. It falls far short of both.” The projected revenues amounted to only a third of the war’s annual outlays and only half of what Roosevelt sought. They also fell an estimated $50 billion short of what was needed to close the inflation gap. For months Ralph Robey railed against the proposed tax bill as inadequate and argued for a national sales tax that would bite more directly into consumer spending at every income level. It was, he conceded, “one of the most regressive known” taxes, but it fought inflation directly and, since end users paid it, the tax could not be passed along to someone else. The cost of the war had barely been touched, inflation remained a threat, and the new system pretty much ended the usefulness of income taxes as a source of more revenue.12”
</p>


<hr>

<br>

<p>
“One other flaw in the tax system ultimately led to an innovation that proved enduring. Income taxes were due at the end of each year, which put the burden on taxpayers to save enough money during the year to meet their obligation. This arrangement deprived the government of the revenue until year’s end, and major shortfalls were likely with the new act bringing into the system so many new taxpayers unfamiliar with it. Beardsley Ruml thought he had a solution to the problem. The treasurer of R. H. Macy &amp; Co. and chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, he advanced the novel idea of having citizens pay their taxes in installments throughout the year, either directly or through their payroll at work. This pay-as-you-go plan would regularize income to the government and relieve taxpayers of having to meet the total bill at year’s end.”
</p>


<hr>

<br>

<p>
“Ruml’s idea was disarmingly simple: forget paying taxes on 1941 income and start making periodic payments for 1942. The Treasury would continue to receive income every year based on the income of that year; thereafter payments would be on a current basis of paying estimated installments on that year’s taxes. The plan, said Ruml, would move the “tax clock forward, and cost the Treasury nothing until Judgment Day.”14”
</p>


<hr>

<p>
“The president also felt the sting of the new law personally. Two weeks before signing the bill he wrote a memo to Eleanor warning that the new law would “result in such a cut in the net I receive from the Government that we shall have to take some steps to reduce the White House food bill, to which I pay $2,000 a month . . . Next year the taxes on $75,000 will leave me only about $30,000 net and SOMETHING HAS TO BE DONE! . . . The only thing I can think of is to reduce the number of servants we feed . . . I would suggest that something drastic be done about the size of the portions served.”16”

“For all the emphasis given to industrial expansion, victory depended greatly on rural America. More food was needed than ever before to feed not only the population but also a rapidly growing military and Allies who were in some cases on the brink of starvation. Russia and China desperately needed food, but so did Great Britain. Producing more food became an urgent goal, but agriculture could not be harnessed to the war effort as easily or efficiently as industry. By 1940 farmers had endured twenty years of hard times that drove many from the land and left many more barely surviving. They suffered from the long-standing problems of excess capacity, surpluses, and too many marginal producers that created a rural version of unemployment.22”
</p>


<hr>

<br>

<p>
“Increased yields depended first, as always, on the weather, but also on overcoming problems familiar to industrialists as well. Farmers needed more machines, especially tractors, and phosphate fertilizers, both of which required priorities for materials and production. They needed an efficient distribution system and a market that did not squeeze their profit margins. Above all, they needed more labor and a clear organizing voice in Washington to oversee the whole process of food production and distribution. Despite the promise of better times, more farmers were going out of business. Some were being drafted; others left for factory jobs, and still others simply couldn’t afford to keep going. Between January 1940 and July 1941 some 1.8 million workers left the farm for greener pastures in war plants.”

“For 1942 WPB had allotted enough materials to manufacture 83 percent of the farm implements produced in 1940; the projection for 1943 sliced that amount to 33 percent. The shortage of both labor and equipment did not bode well for plans to increase yields. Dealing with these problems demanded stronger, more centralized leadership in Washington, but so far Roosevelt had resisted all suggestions for creating a food czar. Most of the burden fell on the Department of Agriculture, which Claude Wickard had reorganized in December 1941 to handle his increased load. The creation of WPB a month later, however, scattered responsibility for management of the food supply across several war agencies, thereby limiting Wickard’s power. No one had clear-cut authority to oversee the whole process or plan for future emergencies. The onset of shortages made this need more evident, but a solution was not easy to formulate.27”
</p>


<hr>

<br>

<p>
“Roosevelt came to his own conclusion. A food czar would solve some problems but create others. Conflicts would arise with the manpower, transportation, and other agencies. He might deem a carload of food crucial only to interfere with the use of the car for steel considered equally or even more crucial. Such conflicts, and they would be many, would have to be mediated, wasting even more time.”
</p>


<hr>

<br>

<p>
“The United States produced about half the world’s entire output of steel and had twelve times the capacity of Japan and far more than all of Nazi-controlled Europe, yet it still did not have enough. By midsummer the steel crisis was full-blown. In May WPB banned the use of steel on 400 civilian products. Already it had tried several devices to alleviate the shortage of scrap, a crucial ingredient in the manufacture of steel.37”
</p>


<hr>

<br>

<p>
“WPB did not recognize the scrap yards that remained open as a war industry and handed them the lowest priority rating, which forced some yards to close because they couldn’t get even nails for upkeep and repairs. To ease the shortage, WPB launched a nationwide campaign to gather scrap from all sources. International Harvester mobilized its chain of 10,000 dealers and large publicity department to beat the bushes in rural America, telling farmers, “There’s a Bomb in Your Barnyard.” Nelson published a plea to industrial executives that “all unusable material, equipment and stocks should be scrapped at once and put back into war production.”39”
</p>


<hr>

<br>

<p>
“Surveys indicated that about 700 pounds of scrap could be got from an average farm and 100 pounds from an average home. Theaters offered free admission for scrap, churches and civic clubs organized drives, and the Brooklyn Dodgers offered kids a free ticket for every ten pounds of scrap. The offer produced 60 tons of scrap and got 60,000 diligent kids a free visit to Ebbets Field. The old cruiser Olympia, once the flagship of Admiral Dewey at Manila, had her 5,865 tons reduced to scrap. The Union Pacific Railroad pulled up the historic rails of its original transcontinental line across Utah for scrap. Every town had its odd scrap story, like the widow of a Spanish-American War veteran who donated the iron bench she used to sit by her husband’s grave. The steel industry conducted its own drive, reversing the role of its 2,000 salesmen by sending them on the road to buy scrap from their former peacetime customers. Yet Fortune called WPB’s scrap drives “flaccid and disappointing.”40”
</p>

<p>
“The shortage had already produced casualties, most notably the abrupt cancellation in July of Andrew Jackson Higgins’s record contract for 200 Liberty ships for lack of steel to complete the huge new yard he was building for the work. The volatile Higgins protested loudly, insisting that the problem had more to do with politics than with the steel shortage. Outraged that he had been persuaded to take the contract only to be stopped in midstride, he rushed to Washington and demanded an investigation. One reporter called the episode “the most colossal, $20 million blunder of this whole cockeyed war.”41<br>
Over $9 million had already been spent on the yard’s construction, and people had moved to New Orleans expecting to get jobs there. The AFL tried to use its influence, and black leaders protested the loss of opportunity, but to no avail. Congress investigated, but the decision held. The yard, said Jerry Land of the Maritime Commission, was the last to start construction and the easiest to cancel.”
</p>


<hr>

<br>

<p>
“It happened because other yards had shortened their time for completing Liberty ships so well that they burned through the allotment of steel twice as fast, leaving none for a large new project like Higgins’s. As the shortages and subsequent delays continued to mount, it became clear that expansion of facilities alone would not solve the problem.42”

“The role, in short, was that of a go-between, and it had to be handled delicately. “If they disturb industrial practices too much,” Novick warned, “there is grave danger that manufacturing activity may be impeded so that it will not reach maximum production goals. If they do not interfere enough, there is equally grave danger that materials, labor, and industrial plant and machinery urgently required for war production will be diverted to other uses.” Put another way, finding the best means of balancing the flow of materials in a wartime economy required finding the best method of balancing controls over the process. The old priority systems had not gone far enough, but PRP had gone too far.”
</p>


<hr>

<br>

<p>
“Eberstadt, a leading advocate of vertical allocation, set about designing a new system for controlling materials. Half a dozen other proposals for vertical systems also competed for attention. Nathan’s Planning Committee had turned its attention to the allocation problem in August and a month later officially endorsed a vertical approach. However, it was the talented and hard-driving Eberstadt who seized the leadership role that WPB had so often lacked. The vigorous debate over philosophies, policies, and techniques of control, which had been ongoing since May, culminated in October with the decision to adopt a plan that embodied elements from several other proposals. Announced publicly on November 2, it was called the Controlled Materials Plan (CMP) and proved ultimately to be a turning point in the constant battle over production and priorities.45”
</p>


<hr>

<br>

<p>
“In designing and appraising a control mechanism, six points emerged as fundamental. How rapidly could it be put into operation? How useful was it as a device for gathering essential statistical data? How feasible was it to administer? How effective was it as a device for carrying out broad policy decisions? How flexible was it in meeting the demands of constantly shifting military requirements? How much paperwork was involved in making it function?46”
</p>


<hr>

<br>

<p>
“Novick concluded that “in retrospect, it is difficult to name a factor more important than paper work in delaying the appearance of a real vertical system of control until 1943.” The trick lay in finding a way to minimize the flow of paper and reports while still providing WPB with the essential tools to push the production effort.47”
</p>


<hr>

<br>

<p>
“For CMP to be effective, it had to be introduced slowly and with careful preparations. PRP had foundered in large part because it had first been delayed and then rushed into service before necessary preparations had been made. It suffered from lack of staff, inadequate training for those it had, and incomplete processing procedures among other things. Nelson determined not to make the same mistake again. The thrashing out of the plan remained internal until the November 2 bulletin to avoid criticism from special interests and politicizing the process. The bulletin outlined how CMP would work and included a chronology of the steps to be taken to implement it. The process would take place gradually over an eight-month period, go into partial effect in March, and finally take full effect on July 1, 1943. During those months staff would be carefully trained, criticism absorbed, adjustments made, and procedures refined to accommodate any problems not foreseen by the plan.48”

“The directives to his officers were short and to the point: “Get the airplanes out. Be absolutely sure they are mechanically all they ought to be. Fight like hell for the proper guns and armor. Keep costs down and forget about profits. We’ll work that out at the proper time with the government.” He insisted that he was an executive rather than a production man, “and there is a hell of a difference.” The trick, he once told Emanuel, “is in putting a man in a job, giving him complete responsibility, not bothering him, and not letting anyone else bother him.”

“Willow Run sprawled a mile long and a quarter-mile across, enclosing more floor space than the prewar plants of Consolidated, Boeing, and Douglas combined. On its vast floor stood 1,600 machine tools and 7,000 fixtures and jigs, some of them sixty feet long. Overhead ran a conveyer system that would carry nose and tail assemblies for the stream of B-24 bombers that would flow out of the plant’s doors once it became operational. The talk was of possibly a thousand planes a month, but production would not likely start until late 1942 or early 1943. “We did not know,” admitted Sorensen, “until this war job came along what it meant to be really busy again, really making things again.” And now he was itching to get started making what many believed was the most important weapon in the new kind of war being fought.52”

“he still insisted on taking the design of anything he made and mocking it up into three dimensions so that it could be studied and prodded to find its flaws. He had made models down to the last detail of a tank, an aircraft engine, and even both the River Rouge and Willow Run plants. His production planning philosophy came from Henry Ford and remained inviolable. “Unless you can see a thing,” he said, “you cannot simplify it. And unless you can simplify it, it’s a good sign you cannot make it.” But Sorensen had also acquired a mastery of metals through experiments on his own. Above all, he demanded a full effort at production.”
</p>


<hr>

<br>

<p>
“Once at the Rouge he wanted to boost engine output to 2,000 units a day. The foundryman said flatly it could not be done. “Then,” said Sorensen, “I’m afraid you are fired.” His successor struggled in vain to reach the goal, but at least he tried, which was all Sorensen asked. Eventually production reached 9,000 units a day.53”

“When Ford agreed in 1940 to make airplane engines for Pratt &amp; Whitney, Sorensen learned the vast difference between them and automobile engines. An eighteen-cylinder Pratt &amp; Whitney 2,000-horsepower engine packed the same power as one and a quarter Ford V-8 engines, yet weighed only one pound per horsepower compared to the V-8’s seven pounds. The machining required much higher tolerances, and expensive new tools were required along with a new plant to house them. Sorensen got it done so vigorously that the first engines rolled off the line in August 1941, eleven months after ground was broken for the new factory. He managed it by using the aircraft company as a classroom to learn new skills, and he did the same when Knudsen asked the auto manufacturers to make bomber parts. Willow Run was the outcome of that education; some thought it might well turn out to be a white elephant that swallowed some 7 million man-hours of work in tooling alone.”
</p>


<hr>

<br>

<p>
“The B-24 posed an even more formidable challenge. Sorensen had one flown to Dearborn, where his engineers tore it down piece by piece and then put it back together again. Where an automobile averaged 15,000 parts, the B-24 had 30,000 different kinds of parts and more than 100,000 in all. Each kind required its own blueprint, which meant miles of paper, and precise machining on tools foreign to automobile makers.”

“A group of seven California companies plus Boeing in Seattle made the bulk of American warplanes, and they faced a backlog of $9 billion in orders. They had always been fiercely competitive and individualistic, but the war had put them in an unprecedented situation. More planes than they had ever built were demanded faster than they had ever built them. Everyone was fighting labor shortages, pinching workers from one another, crying for materials, and fearful of a recommendation by the Truman Committee that the president appoint an aircraft czar to organize and drive the production effort. In April Donald Douglas called his peers together in a series of meetings to ponder the problem. “We looked at each other and realized that any one of us might be picked for the czar,” he said later. “Nobody wanted to be czar, and we didn’t want anybody else as czar. So we decided to offer the President an eight-president soviet to regiment our part of the industry.”55”

“The result was the Aircraft War Production Council (AWPC), which Douglas waggishly called “an outstanding example of capitalistic collectivism, which spells democracy.” Members referred to it simply as “the Western pot.” The premise was disarmingly simple: The companies would share everything from technology to techniques to parts to keep production moving. J. H. “Dutch” Kindelberger of North American became AWPC’s first president and set the tone by calling together his department heads and telling them, “From now on, we’re going to give our competitors anything we’ve got, with no hedging or holding back. They’re going to do the same for us.” By the following week subcommittees were meeting to deal with special problems. Some officers went away dazed at the transformation. “I’ve worked on airplanes for thirteen years,” said a Lockheed official, “but I’d never seen the inside of another factory until the subcommittee I’m on visited North American.”56”

“He made the tour with a man from Consolidated. “Boy,” he said, “the minute we got into the tubing department, Kelly, of Consolidated, and I began getting ideas. They were cutting tubing with a speed we couldn’t touch. Then I noticed all their jigs were painted light color, so that plane parts were easy to see. Ours were dull gray. They had girls doing work that our gals never attempted.” For his part Kindelberger reported that Vultee had given him engineering data that had cost it $250,000 and several months’ time. Vultee also loaned thirty of its best engineers to Vega to speed up its production line of B-17s. If one company was short of parts or material, it called around to see who had extras. Consolidated sent sixteen engine-mount forgings to North American, Lockheed 1,000 stop nuts to Vultee, North American 150 sheets of aluminum to Vultee, Consolidated a half ton of flathead Monel rivets to Ryan, Vultee 1,000 cotter pins to Douglas. “It’s hard to think of cotter pins keeping planes on the ground,” said a Douglas official, “but that is what lack of them did one day.”

“The Navy dive-bombers built by Douglas at El Segundo were stalled for lack of binding-braid wire used to eliminate static electricity. North American located some in its stockroom, and the dive-bombers went off to play a key role in the Battles of the Coral Sea and Midway. North American had a delivery of P-51 Mustangs and Apache fighters ready for the British but needed engine-cooling fluid for their motors. Lockheed happened to have a good supply and sent it over. “Even if we had only a little, we’d have divvied up,” said a Lockheed official. A week earlier they had been stymied by a lack of two-inch chrome molybdenum for their P-38s. North American had only a small supply but divided it with Lockheed to get the planes moving. By one count such borrowings totaled 1,800 in a single month. Everything got traded at cost with AWPC serving as clearinghouse, but no one waited on paperwork to move the parts from one company to another.”

“Engineering data got swapped as easily as parts, and so did machine time. When a hydro press that shaped fuselage and tail parts broke down, Northrop avoided a two-week delay by moving the work to North American. Once the Northrop machines were back online, Douglas sent some of its work there. A few weeks later Consolidated’s hydro press quit working, and Douglas offered one of its machines that stood idle at night. Consolidated piled its dies and materials into trucks and did its work at Douglas overnight. One pool subcommittee discovered that some plants had machines capable of doing their work faster than assembly lines could absorb the output. It made an inventory of machines with excess capacity that other companies could use. Studies of new war-induced problems were also pooled. Boeing agreed to research more use of plastics in planes because it already had a head start in the work, thereby freeing the research staffs of other companies to focus on other problems.”

“Lockheed had studied the problem of getting workers to and from the plant. Its expert juggled jobs to enable more workers to carpool, taking more than 5,000 cars out of use. He also promoted bicycle brigades, bought 4,000 bikes to lease to workers, and arranged for special employee bus routes. All these arrangements he turned over to the other companies for their use. For all the benefits, the production men agreed that “the best part of the deal is the know-how you pick up visiting other factories.” Faster output was the most immediate and important result. Every borrowing eliminated a bottleneck. As Kindelberger observed, “A lot of these planes were delivered ahead of schedule because we threw everything we had into the pot.”

“The basic rule was that no one asked for anything unless he absolutely needed it, and the rule was honored. Once the war ended, the pot would dissolve and the companies would go back to being rivals. “It’s going to make some tough competition,” predicted Douglas, “because nobody has an advantage over anybody else any more.”

“Nothing defined the city of paper more than its bureaucratic fog. On one memorable occasion the vice president of a New York City bank applied for a job in Washington at the Office of Economic Warfare. While he awaited a reply, the agency’s head, Leo Crowley, happened to drop into the same bank and asked its president to recommend somebody for the same job. The president suggested the very same vice president who had applied. Crowley hired him on the spot, and the banker moved to Washington. Weeks later he received a letter forwarded to him from New York. It was from the agency, which rejected his original application on the grounds that he was not qualified for the job. That was painful enough, but on closer inspection the man discovered that he had signed the letter himself.14”

“OPA took more heat than most agencies because of the sensitive nature of its work and the gross unpopularity of price controls and rationing. “I collided regularly with commodity groups,” recalled Galbraith, “the cattlemen, the dairymen and the wool growers, people that Ed O’Neal himself had once told me were too single-mindedly selfish to be tolerable companions in the farm movement.”
</p>

“Galbraith admitted to being “unduly self-righteous” in his defense of price controls, but he could not conceal his disdain for “the lobbyists, trade association representatives, professional business spokesmen and hireling Establishment lawyers who sought to associate patriotism with the need for even more money than they were already making.” The heavy Democratic losses in the November elections, especially in the Midwest, intensified the attack on OPA. Lower-level personnel began leaving the agency, prompting Henderson to quip, “It’s now the mice who are leaving the ship.” Then it was the captain’s turn. On December 18, 1942, Henderson resigned from OPA, pleading ill health. More attacks were coming, he told his staff, and he could best help the agency by leaving it.16”

“Through the last half of 1942 manpower raised nearly as many hackles as rationing and price controls. It threatened to replace the allocation of raw materials as the chief bottleneck in war production. In his October fireside chat after returning from his tour, Roosevelt emphasized two main objectives for manpower: finding and training enough men for the military, and finding enough workers to man the factories already in production and those coming online, as well as providing farms with enough laborers to assure an ample food supply. The difficulty was not lack of people, he stressed. “The problem is to have the right numbers of the right people in the right places at the right time. We are learning to ration materials; and we must now learn to ration manpower.” For that to happen workers had to stop moving from job to job; companies had to stop stealing labor from one another; and more women and grown children had to be employed along with older men and disabled people to free more fit men for military service.18”

“Eberstadt impressed everyone with his CMP, the implementation of which went forward smoothly. Borrowing from various plans already in the air, he fashioned a composite vertical materials allocation plan that was deceptively simple. “On one side of the table, you put the people who make steel,” he said later in describing it, “and on the other those who need it, with the government in between.” Unlike PRP, it revolved around control of only three key materials—carbon and alloy steel, aluminum, and copper—that were basic to virtually all munitions and war products. Sixteen other materials were monitored but not included formally in the plan, which assumed that proper allocation of the big three materials would force the others into appropriate channels as well. What David Novick called the “truly revolutionary step in CMP” lay in one simple statement: “The delivery of controlled materials . . . shall not be affected by preference ratings.” It meant the adoption of a total allocation system for the most basic war production materials. Newsweek hailed it as “a switch from theory to realistic business practice.”38”
</p>


<hr>

<br>

<p>
“In simple terms CMP worked this way. The designated key materials would be allocated to seven claimants—army, navy, Maritime Commission, Lend-Lease, Board of Economic Warfare (BEW), OCS, and a new aircraft scheduling unit in WPB headed by Wilson—who stated their needs, broken down by major programs, for the coming eighteen months. The WPB’s divisions for steel, aluminum, and copper balanced the total needs of claimants against the estimated supply of each material and apportioned the available supply among them. Problems and disputes were referred first to the Requirements Committee and ultimately to Nelson. Once told the amount it would get, each agency parceled it out among its prime contractors, which had earlier given WPB their needs as well. They in turn were responsible for doling out whatever portion of their share was needed by subcontractors.39”
</p>


<hr>

<br>

<p>
“In theory this system would produce a balance of supply and demand for the three essential materials, and hopefully others as well. Uncontrolled parts and materials still received priority ratings from WPB industry divisions or claimant agencies, but nearly all such ratings were inferior to allotment numbers, which became central to the entire operation. They identified the claimant agency, production program and schedule, and the month authorized for shipment of the controlled material. Every stage and input of production, as well as all orders and other paperwork, carried allotment numbers. Among other things they provided a guarantee of delivery.40”

“It seemed relatively simple in concept, yet Novick called it “the most complex piece of administrative machinery created during the . . . war emergency.”41”
</p>


<hr>

<br>

<p>
“The administrative key to mass production,” wrote David Novick, “is the painstaking planning, timing, and direction of the flow of materials and parts through the manufacturing process so that each item arrives at the final assembly line where and when it is needed.” Early arrival cluttered up the production line; late arrival interrupted its operation and slowed output. This model held equally true for an individual plant or for the nation’s overall economy. Integrating this process was an immensely difficult task, and Wilson was reputed to be expert at it. He was the first executive at the agency since Knudsen renowned for his mastery of mass production.42”
</p>


<hr>

“Rationalizing the flow of materials meant little unless they were synchronized with the facilities using them. Unfortunately, these two functions, production and control of materials, could not be cleanly divided, which meant overlapping jurisdictions.”
</p>

“As CMP gradually came online, the shortage of materials eased and components emerged as the primary obstacle to scheduling. These ranged from the smallest bearings to heat exchangers, blowers, turbines, pumps, and thousands of parts essential to the larger end products such as ships, planes, tanks, trucks, and synthetic rubber. By late 1942 the shortage of key components had forced WPB to orchestrate carefully their production and distribution among claimants.54”

“Roosevelt had done much to create this problem by placing the production of airplanes, 100-octane gas, escort vessels, merchant ships, and the construction of rubber facilities on a “must” list with priority over everything else. Since they required many of the same scarce materials, it was impossible to fulfill all of them at once.”

“Baruch professed to have no sympathy for “groaners who complained of small deprivations, and who . . . could not understand why they could not eat as much, wear as much, drive their cars as much, or carry on as though the war did not exist. Yet, there were people like this, and I am sorry to say that some of them were in official Washington.” Neither did he have patience with “the shabby evasions of wartime restrictions I could see going on around me,” and he felt nothing but contempt for “those who, under the guise of free enterprise, profiteered during the war.”

“The seemingly endless struggle within WPB struck many observers as simply one more case of bureaucratic infighting in the City of Paper, but I. F. Stone warned that it was “only superficially a military-civilian struggle. Only 9 percent of the men in the War Department’s services of supply are regular army officers; the rest are businessmen in uniform. It is a clash between two groups of big-business men, one linked with the military bureaucracy, the other somewhat tenuously allied with New Dealers and labor.”75<br>
Stone was right; much more was at stake. The clash also reflected the continuing struggle between the military and civilian authorities over who was to direct the economic foundation of the war effort. Indirectly it also illuminated the issue of who was in charge of that process. Roosevelt remained determined to keep control of it in his own hands because of his distrust of both business and the military, but the endless struggles made clear the weaknesses of this goal. By the spring of 1943 it had become obvious that some new and better arrangement was needed.”

“While other government agencies, business, and the military clawed and scratched at each other, Harold Ickes and the oil industry settled into a smooth, cooperative relationship grounded in mutual trust and respect that resulted in efficient production of the most critical products needed for military and civilian use alike. “We have issued no fiat or ukase,” boasted Ickes. “No dictatorship exists or impends. We . . . had been working in close harmony for many months, but on that memorable morning of December 8, 1941, we really became full-fledged partners in a total war on a common enemy.” Much of that cooperative attitude stemmed from Ickes’s wise choice of Ralph Davies as his deputy. Of him the often harshly critical Ickes said, “I have never encountered greater loyalty or more unselfish devotion to job, or more intelligent cooperation than I have found in . . . Ralph K. Davies.” Their leadership did much to forge a unique bond between the government and an industry that had long been at loggerheads with it.4”

“On the eve of the war the petroleum industry was a $15 billion colossus that employed a million people directly and provided jobs for another 200,000 indirectly through the billion dollars it spent for services and supplies. Its products and by-products comprised 40 percent of the nation’s total mineral output. The military alone routinely used more than 500 different petroleum products, many of them indispensable. In wartime the drain on oil supplies grew exponentially. “The real challenge,” declared Ickes, “is to deliver oil of specified grades, in sufficient quantities, over stretches of land and sea that vary in length from 3,000 to 10,000 miles, and to deliver it on time to do the job, the doing of which depends upon oil, and ever more oil, up to our capacity to supply, refine, and transport it.”5”
</p>


<hr>

<br>

<p>
“Before most people realized it, the industry’s central challenge reversed from trying to control excess production to maximizing output. For this to happen, government and the industry had to reshape their longtime adversarial relationship, and new sources of petroleum had to be found at home and abroad. Ickes and Davies understood this earlier than most, but most of Ickes’s attempts at easing the crisis had been blocked. To make his office effective, Ickes surprised many observers by organizing it along lines that paralleled the main functions of the industry and then staffing it with men from the industry. This approach departed from the usual government way of doing things, and it had to overcome the dark suspicions and distrust of men in the industry toward the government. In this work Davies proved invaluable.7”
</p>


<hr>

<br>

<p>
“To bring the industry together and coordinate its efforts, Ickes divided the country into five districts, each of which contained committees for production, refining, transportation, natural gas and gasoline, and distribution. He then created a Petroleum Industry Council for National Defense composed of seventy-eight industry leaders from both the big companies and the independents. The latter dominated the council but chose as president William R. Boyd Jr., head of the American Petroleum Institute and considered as “belonging lock, stock, and barrel to the major companies.” Ickes had the final say on any decision but took care to run everything through the Council for their input. Boyd could not have been more pleased at the approach of his old adversary. “It is the luckiest thing that ever happened to the oil industry,” he said, “that it fell into the hands of its archenemy.”8”

“To hike output quickly, the industry borrowed a page from the aircraft manufacturers. Components were shared by moving them to the refinery best suited to maximize their use for production of 100 octane and nothing else. If one company’s blending agents would produce more 100 octane with another firm’s base stock than with its own, it was sent there. This sharing cost money, violated contracts, and reduced the output of other petroleum products, but it produced more 100 octane. The Justice Department signed off on the practice as it did on other joint arrangements on patents, processes, and licensing. Jersey Standard opened its fluid cat-cracking process to other companies and invited them to send technicians to study the method in operation. Hardly anyone had expected so much cooperation among companies accustomed to fighting each other. As Ickes noted wryly, the early meetings “were not love feasts,” but gradually the cooperative spirit took hold, especially after Pearl Harbor.30”

“Before Pearl Harbor tank cars moved 70,000 barrels of oil a day; by July 1942 an estimated 70,000 of them hauled an astounding 850,000 barrels a day. Before the war a fleet of 1,400 barges carried petroleum, about 950 of them on the Gulf Coast and Mississippi River and another 300 on the Atlantic Coast. Only about 100 large oceangoing barges with a capacity of about 15,000 barrels were in service, along with 1,300 inland barges that averaged about 5,000 barrels. Their increased service in the Midwest released tank cars for use in eastern deliveries, but most of their work consisted of short hauls and did little to relieve the critical need for longer hauls. Tank trucks, operating on a 24/7 schedule, also did much of the short-haul work.38”

“The Tulsa meeting thrashed out a comprehensive pipeline program, most of which gained approval. Nine of ten specific proposals, all of them designed to relieve the East Coast shortage, won immediate acceptance and were started. None drew more attention than the two pipelines from Texas to New York. The 24-inch project would be the largest pipeline in the world, the 20-inch the longest. Workers soon dubbed them “Big Inch” and “Little Inch.” Several leading oil companies would operate them, the RFC would finance them, and the DPC would own them. Once under way, the projects encountered no more refusals in getting materials. In October 1942 WPB approved the second half of Big Inch running from Norris City to Phoenixville, Pennsylvania, where feeder lines carried oil to the New York area. Work began in August 1942 and reached New York in October 1943. Little Inch extended from Beaumont, Texas, to Norris City and from there to Phoenixville. Construction got under way in April 1943 and was completed in February 1944.41<br>

“Yet it was never enough. Despite heroic efforts, shortages continued to plague both military and civilian use. During the harsh winter of 1942–43 northeasterners endured rationing of both gasoline and fuel oil. Amid subzero weather Ickes ordered tank cars to haul only fuel oil instead of gasoline to the shivering East and cut the ration of fuel oil for nonheating use by 40 percent. By spring eastern reserves hit a record low of 25.5 percent of normal. Prentiss Brown, who had adopted his own version of the honor system against pleasure driving, yielded reluctantly to the pressures and resorted to enforcing a mandatory ban on nonessential driving in twelve eastern states. A major reason for the shortages lay in the expanding war effort and the voracious appetite of planes, ships, tanks, trucks, and other vehicles for fuel. Bombers consumed up to 400 gallons of gasoline an hour, while destroyers on convoy burned up to 3,000 gallons of fuel oil an hour.45”

“The clash between Patterson and Jeffers showcased the extent to which rubber competed with 100 octane as the most urgent stuff needed for the war effort. That both depended on the same industry for their production underscored the importance of oil in the Victory Program. There was more than a little irony in the fact that the giant corporations Americans loved to hate became the most significant players in the mobilization for war and the war itself. If the big oil companies had not gone to extraordinary lengths in their performance, the war might well have been lost. Of these companies Jersey Standard emerged as the most conspicuous and controversial, not only because of its history but also because of its relationship with IG Farben—a connection that contributed more to the war effort than anyone realized.”

“Buna-S emerged as the primary synthetic rubber for making tires. It consisted roughly of three parts butadiene and one part styrene. Butadiene was a relatively simple hydrocarbon familiar to most chemistry students, composed of four atoms of carbon and six of hydrogen. The fact that it could be made from either petroleum or alcohol—which itself could be made from petroleum—had the ironic twist of injecting a political dimension into the problem of how best to produce a lot of it in the shortest possible time.49<br>
Shortly after his rubber report was issued in September 1942, Baruch told Frank Howard, who had not been involved in the research or testimony, that the rubber program was industry’s job, not the government’s, and that he should raise hell with anybody in Washington who wasn’t moving fast enough on it. He also thought that butadiene production would likely be the bottleneck of the whole program and that it was up to Jersey Standard and an affiliate of Union Carbide to get their new plants up and running on schedule with their new processes. They were the linchpins on which everything else depended. “I know you can do it,” Baruch added[…]”

“The goal given the oil industry was expanded from its original 40,000 tons to 400,000 tons in January 1942 and then, after the fall of Singapore in February, to 805,000 tons of Buna-type rubber with butadiene as its main raw material. The butadiene could be made in several ways, but two stood out as the most feasible: convert butane into butylene and the latter into butadiene, or start with butylene—a by-product of the refining process—and go directly to butadiene. Everyone agreed that there was more than enough butane to make all the butadiene needed, but the two-step process required was obviously longer and more cumbersome than starting with butylene. The question was whether enough butylene could be obtained as a by-product without cutting into the production of 100 octane, which also required it. Jersey Standard had studied the issue for two years and concluded that its refineries had enough butylene to make both products. Shell came to the same conclusion, but the rest of the oil industry disagreed and based their plans on butane even though it meant expensive plants and serious operating difficulties.52”

“During 1942 the alcohol situation reversed itself from a deficit caused by the loss of Cuban molasses to a surplus triggered by the major liquor distillers, who offered to convert their plants to the manufacture of industrial alcohol. After much delay and a congressional hearing the offer was accepted, and the government went even further by enlisting the straight whiskey or so-called high wine distillers as well. The production of blended whiskey and gin ceased—a large reserve already existed—and was replaced by an outpouring of industrial alcohol that promised to double or even triple its output by 1943. The cost was higher than alcohol made from blackstrap molasses, but cost became less of a relevant factor in the emergency. A more difficult problem involved the familiar one of allocating raw materials between plants using alcohol and the refineries using petroleum.55”
</p>


<hr>

<br>

<p>
“The furor over oil versus grain as a source of alcohol reached its peak during the summer of 1942 with the Gillette bill and Roosevelt’s veto of it, which led to his appointing the Baruch Committee. Between March and June the RRC contracted for 646,000 tons of butadiene, 526,200 tons of it from petroleum, 80,000 tons from alcohol, and the remaining 40,000 tons from benzene. However, all the alcohol-based butadiene was to be made by a Union Carbide affiliate that used synthetic alcohol made from petroleum. The farm bloc protested that grain alcohol could make butadiene faster and more cheaply with simpler facilities. The RRC promptly shifted 140,000 tons from petroleum to alcohol base, but the controversy continued. In their report the Baruch Committee took no stand on the issue. When Bill Jeffers was appointed rubber director in September, his marching orders were simple and direct: take the muddled synthetic rubber program with all its controversies and bull it through.56”

“By Washington standards Bill Jeffers was a monk. He harbored no political ambitions, took no part in its social life, curried no favors, and showed no interest in anything except doing the job he had been summoned to do. In taking the post he told Roosevelt he would stay for one year; he expected to get the job done in that time and go back home to the railroad he loved. During that time he utterly ignored the Washington way of doing things and emerged as something of a folk hero in the process. “Here at last,” declared the New York Herald Tribune, “is a man in high position who says in blunt words what every American has longed to hear said by those in charge of our war program in Washington.”58”
</p>


<hr>

<br>

<p>
“Jeffers also antagonized Patterson by his insistence that civilians needed tires as badly as the military. “A man who works in a grocery store,” he said to the Truman Committee, “is just as important in the war effort as a man who works in a war factory.” This attitude infuriated Patterson, who saw any allocation to civilians as unnecessary. “Which will do most to win the war,” he chided, “continue to deplete our rubber resources in unessential automobile travel, or produce the 100-octane gasoline that will be needed for Army and Navy combat planes?”
</p>

”In getting critical components for his plants, Jeffers mined his railroad network of contacts. On one occasion he called Charlie Hardy of American Car &amp; Foundry and asked if he could make heat exchangers. “I don’t know,” answered Hardy. “What are they?”64<br>
“I don’t know,” said Jeffers, “but I’ll put a man on a plane today to come up to Boston to explain it to you.” A day or two later Hardy called back and said he could make them. That to Jeffers exemplified how to eliminate bottlenecks: “Just tell American industry you need 10,000 heat exchangers, and then get out of their way and they will make them for you.” Of course, it was not that simple. To get what he wanted Jeffers fought with everybody, including Nelson. One of the dustups grew so heated that Roosevelt took them aside to mediate, saying in his best “Poppa” voice, “Well, you fellows are just going to have to get together.” Jeffers glared at him and said, “Well, we’re not going to get together on the basis of anything I heard here today.” And walked out.65”

”Altogether the government spent $700 million to build fifty-one synthetic rubber plants. Overall production soared from 22,434 tons in 1942 to 231,722 tons in 1943 and 753,111 tons in 1944. Later the program would be hailed as one more “miracle of production,” but it was far from that. Robert A. Solo, who had worked in OPM and elsewhere during the war, wrote after the war that “stripped of its mythology, the planning of the synthetic rubber industry was a scandalous, a complete, a nearly catastrophic foul up.” The Baruch report finally brought some order to the chaos it had been, and Jeffers did his part in belatedly hammering it into existence against all obstacles. True to his word, satisfied that his work was done, Jeffers turned his post over to Bradley Dewey and went back to Omaha to reacquaint the railroad with his special brand of intimidation.67”

The goal was to smother the enemy in weaponry; the method was to devise an organization, a system, and a plant layout that would produce as much as possible as fast as possible. A month after Pearl Harbor Roosevelt said as much in his State of the Union address. “The superiority of the United Nations in munitions and ships must be overwhelming,” he stressed, “so overwhelming that the Axis Nations can never hope to catch up with it.” The finished product did not have to be perfect—the cost of perfection in both time and money was too high—it just had to be somewhere between good and really good. As historian Alan S. Milward observed, everyone understood that “the gain in output was far greater than 10 percent if an armament was produced to only 90 percent rather than to 100 percent, of the specifications . . . It was open to the United States to sacrifice some quality in production for quantity, but Germany could not compete in quantity production and opted to produce armaments[…]”

”The Germans excelled at advanced technologies, research, and high-precision weaponry that performed flawlessly, but they were slow to standardize and maximize production. At one point their factories were turning out 425 different kinds of airplanes, 151 types of trucks, and 150 different motorcycles. For all their breathtaking scientific and industrial achievements, they were at heart craftsmen.5”

”With such a variety,” wrote Richard Overy, “it was difficult to produce in mass.” Within the German system the military dictated what weapons would be produced. Hitler himself remarked in 1942 how industrialists “were always complaining about this niggardly procedure—today an order for ten howitzers, tomorrow for two mortars and so on.” The military had only contempt for American mass-production methods that, in Hermann Goering’s sneer, produced only razor blades. Overy concluded that “as long as the military tail wagged the industrial dog, German war production remained inflexible, unrationalised and excessively bureaucratic.”6”
</p>


<hr>

<p>
”Nevertheless, in a memorandum to Hitler he described the war as a “contest between two systems of organization.” The Americans “knew how to act with organizationally simple methods and therefore achieved greater results, whereas we were hampered by superannuated forms of organization and therefore could not match the others’ feats . . . If we did not arrive at a different system of organization . . . it would be evident to posterity that our outmoded, tradition-bound, and arthritic organizational system had lost the struggle.”7”

”During 1943 the leviathan that was American industry was at last roused from its slumber and pushed toward maximum output. Old and new weapons poured forth from old and new factories in unprecedented quantities. One estimate measured American output per worker-hour as double that of Germany and five times that of Japan, and the United States had many more workers. By year’s end the United States boasted an arsenal that gave it three times the munitions of the Axis. Roosevelt’s call for overwhelming superiority in arms had been realized. During that decisive year the tide of production turned the tide of battle. Amid the pride over the sheer quantity of goods rolling off the assembly lines, however, some nagging questions remained. Was the right stuff being made? Was it good enough to compete with the known superiority of many German weapons? Were the weapons suitable for two theaters of war—Europe and the Pacific—that could not have been more different from each other?9”

”During the first twenty days of March 1943 U-boats sank ninety-seven Allied merchant ships with tonnage totaling more than 500,000. This was twice the rate of new ships being built; the Germans lost only seven submarines, half the number of new boats coming out of shipyards. Then the tide began to turn as the Allies relied increasingly on a long-range version of the B-24 Liberator, escort destroyers, and escort or baby carriers to protect the sea lanes. In May the Germans lost forty-one U-boats while sinking only fifty merchant ships, a devastating turnabout. By July the launching of new ships from American shipyards finally exceeded the tonnage lost since 1939.10”

”The tide of battle had turned, and so had the tide of production, although it did not seem so at first. Despite all the intramural turmoil during the winter of 1942–43, real progress was made in production scheduling and the allocation of materials. PEC eased one major bottleneck by devising a new approach to the production and allocation of thirty-four common components that ultimately tabulated, verified, and tracked them much as the three key materials were under CMP. By winter the component crisis had replaced the materials shortage as the major threat to production gains. More than 5,000 manufacturers made critical components, but no one coordinated the scheduling and allocation of their output. Instruments rolled off the assembly lines only to stack up in warehouses because the claimant did not need them at once while other claimants screamed for them. In one typical case 200 instruments went to a plant that was not scheduled to open for several months.11”
</p>


<hr>

<br>

<p>
”Examples of plants being held up for lack of components ran into the hundreds and were almost routine,” admitted a WPB engineer. WPB attacked the problem by freezing orders so they could be scheduled according to when and where they were actually needed. At one plant output increased by 20 percent simply by eliminating the interruptions of production when an order in progress was set aside to produce one with a more urgent priority.”
</p>


<hr>

<br>

<p>
”After surveying manufacturers for statements of unfilled orders, capacity, and material needs, Wilson and Cordiner issued General Scheduling Order M-293 imposing controls on eighty-six products and classifying critical items into three groups based on relative scarcity. Although this ambitious and complex scheme helped, it did not solve the larger problem.12”

”Fred Lucker, a veteran production man at Ingersoll-Rand, who had been scheduling compressors since May 1942, despaired over the crisis facing him. His desk overflowed with demands of a million horsepower for the coming year; the industry’s capacity was only 600,000 horsepower. When he started looking more closely at the orders, however, “the smoke blew away.” One plant, for example, ordered 45,000 horsepower for October 1942 delivery even though it was not due to open until late 1943. Lucker began insisting on true needed dates and remained flexible in his allocations. When the Boston Navy Yard needed a compressor in three weeks to put a damaged ship back into service, Lucker diverted one from a new steel foundry that was running behind its intended completion date. “In general,” said Lucker, “we find that 10 per cent of an industry represents 90 per cent of our problems.”13”

“six times above normal in 1942 yet still ran behind demand. Fisher Governor of Marshalltown, Iowa, which made control valves, thought it could go no further in subcontracting until it sent two men to scout neighboring rural areas for machine shops. In short order its subcontracted machine-tool hours jumped from 200 per week to 3,000.”

“The weapons poured forth in incredible quantities. During the first year after Pearl Harbor American plants built 47,826 planes; in 1943 they produced 85,898. Those rolling off the assembly lines at the end, especially the flood of bombers, were much larger than their predecessors at the start of the war, averaging 11,000 pounds compared to 4,000 pounds. The number of major ships jumped from 1,854 in 1942 to 2,654 in 1943 and tanks from 24,997 to 29,497.15<br>
After hitting its stride in 1943, the industrial leviathan buried the Axis powers in output. Between 1939 and August 1945 American manufacturers produced a total of 303,713 military aircraft compared to 111,787 for Germany, 131,549 for Great Britain, and 76,320 for Japan. These figures included 99,950 American fighters as opposed to 55,727 for Germany and 30,447 for Japan; 97,810 American bombers compared to 15,117 for Japan and 12,539 attack aircraft for Germany; and 23,929 American transports, dwarfing Germany’s 3,079 and Japan’s 2,110. In training aircraft the United States had an overwhelming edge of 57,623 to Germany’s 11,546 and Japan’s 15,201. Between 1940 and 1945 the military accepted 802,161 aircraft engines from American manufacturers.16<br>
For ground warfare, American factories produced 88,410 tanks[…]”
</p>

“Ships poured forth in such quantity that by the end of 1943 the nation had replaced all its maritime losses and seized first place among the merchant fleets of the world. Seven freighters were sliding into the water every twenty-four hours, yet so routine had the output become that the media hardly noticed it. In eighteen months more new tonnage had been built than during the five years of the last war. If, as expected, another 15 million to 20 million tons floated into action during 1944, the United States, having started the war with a fleet half the size of Great Britain’s, would possess one two to three times larger. In July 1944 Kaiser’s Richmond Yard No. 2 completed its 1,147th and last Liberty ship, leaving only a scattered handful in eastern yards to be finished. By then the navy’s fleet was larger than the combined fleets of all the world five years earlier.20”

“Quantity mattered in the American way of production. Early in the defense mobilization effort Patterson discovered that it was difficult to get the production rates he wanted from manufacturers for any complex item such as trucks unless he projected the order on a massive scale with plenty of lead time for them to organize the needed resources. Once the United States entered the war and weapons took priority, conversion caused delays but ultimately shortened the lead time and increased output. It was in fact the rapid expansion of facilities that caused many of the shortages in materials. The weapons produced at first were often inferior and sometimes already obsolete, but they were birds in hand that had to suffice until something better could replace them. The challenge of so far-flung a war with such rapidly changing demands also bedeviled production. Not only did hundreds, sometimes thousands of design changes get imposed in midmanufacture, but some items were abruptly terminated altogether when improved versions appeared or needs at the fronts changed.21”

“Toluene offered one more example of a war material provided by the organizations many Americans, especially New Dealers, loved to hate: the major corporations. Their domination of the production effort was as obvious as it was necessary. The Truman Committee found that the 100 corporations having the largest contracts for war materials owned about 70 percent of the total prime contracts for the period June 1940 to September 1943 compared to their having only 30 percent of prewar civilian business. Put another way, when the defense program began in 1940, about 175,000 companies produced 70 percent of the manufacturing output, with the top 100 firms providing the other 30 percent. By March 1943 this ratio had been reversed. Not surprisingly, the big companies grew even bigger. By December 1944 firms with more than 10,000 workers employed over 30 percent of all manufacturing workers compared to only 13 percent in December 1939. During this same period the share of workers employed by small manufacturing firms with fewer than 100 employees dropped from 26 percent in 1939 to 19 percent in 1944.26”

“In terms of sheer dimensions and quantities, this was by far the nation’s largest war and one that demanded almost everything on a colossal scale. The marvel is not that the giant corporations played so overarching a role; it is rather that so many smaller companies played as many varied and invaluable roles as they did. Nor should it be overlooked that the big corporations relied heavily on platoons of subcontractors in most of their projects.”

“Tempting as it was, their training could not be rushed. “You can’t train more than so many people at once,” said a plant manager, “any more than you can eat a whole week’s meals at once.”
</p>


<hr>

<br>

<p>
“it took a month or six weeks to train anyone for even a simple repetitive operation, and eight months or more for turbine work requiring ten-thousandths-of-an-inch tolerances. Foremen were especially hard to get and keep in the numbers needed, and they were the heart of production. “Without competent foremen,” observed one writer, “greenhorns would stay green, spoilage would soar, quality would slide, and production would evaporate.”29”

“Automatic machinery along with $2 million in jigs and fixtures, some of them clever improvisations, were installed to simplify tasks. This combination of greenhorns and shortcut engineering techniques enabled the plant to produce 385 complete ship-propulsion units during the war at the rate of more than a million horsepower a year, three times the scheduled capacity.34”
</p>


<hr>

<br>

<p>
“A similar pattern unfolded at the Louisville, Kentucky, plant, which made single and twin 5-inch naval antiaircraft guns. A series of improvised shortcuts, coupled with solid training, enabled greenhorns to perform jobs normally reserved for seasoned workers. At peak production the plant turned out seventy-five singles and twenty-eight twins a month; the navy had reckoned on fifteen and five because the machining required had to be so precise.”
</p>


<hr>

<br>

<p>
“The people who built these guns came from 257 different vocations ranging from dentist to salesgirl to cartoonist. At first the company hired a nucleus of skilled men from the Louisville &amp; Nashville Railroad and a local cigarette company and sent them for training to the Naval Gun Factory. They became the core foremen and inspectors for a workforce that brought only average strength and intelligence to the job. The key, as always, was careful specialization. Every worker did one job only, day in and day out, and those jobs were carefully planned by the engineers and supervisors, who devised hundreds of special tools, jigs, gages, routines, and inspection systems. Black workers were recruited, along with deaf people, who received special bright red caps so fellow workers knew to warn them of steel swinging overhead or other perils. At least the Louisville workers got to see their finished product. At the Westinghouse factory in Canton, Ohio, the employees toiled endlessly on millions of component parts for weapons they never saw.36”
</p>

“The key to this system lay in rigid quality control. No finished product left the factory until it was approved by the military’s own inspectors. To eliminate the waste of rejects, the company’s inspectors hovered over every step of production. Catching flaws early minimized the loss of further time and resources later. The raw-materials inspectors scrutinized every form of incoming supplies, not only visually but with magnetic and X-ray tests before they reached the floor. The pressure on the inspectors, especially the navy’s own men, was terrific. Sometimes they held up production because they didn’t know enough and had to consult the Naval Gun Factory; sometimes the drawings given them had not been updated with the latest changes. Under the duress of mass production, speed and quality made strange bedfellows.37”

“Disappointment over Brewster’s performance, however intense, paled before that expressed about Willow Run. Here was the largest factory ever built, with more than 2.5 million square feet of floor space, a monument to the American genius for mass production, called by Charles A. Lindbergh “a sort of a Grand Canyon of the mechanized world,” yet by August 1942 it had not turned out a single B-24 bomber for the war effort.”
</p>


<hr>

<p>
“He had built Willow Run not in a straight line, as the original plans called for, but in an L shape with two special turntables at the bend to turn the assembly lines. Why? The land beneath Willow Run lay in Washtenaw County, a solidly Republican enclave. Extending the plant straight ahead would carry it across the line into Wayne County, the home of liberal Democratic administrations with their prolabor sympathies and tax assessors. Henry Ford wanted no part of them.”
</p>


<hr>

<br>

<p>
“the design of Willow Run owed far more to his automobile than airplane experience. He decided on extensive use of hard steel dies, which were durable and ideal for big production runs but harder to change out than soft, cheaper dies. People experienced in building planes tried to warn him that design changes were too frequent to invest in hard dies, but Ford ignored their advice. Later the Truman Committee found that he did not listen to the few outside experts; neither did he send many layout and production men to see how planes were made on the West Coast. Ford knew better. He ridiculed the airplane builders as “antiquated” and declared that “the bomber job” differed little from “making auto bodies.” Jeeps were rolling off the assembly lines at River Rouge “like cookies out of a cutter,” and so would bombers at the Run.51”

“Knudsen thought he had the answer to the design change dilemma. Earlier he had urged Patterson to “freeze the designs for a while so we can get some airplanes . . . If we try to keep up to the minute on every airplane we make, we will end up by being late on every airplane made.” Build the planes, he urged, and then add improvements at some place especially equipped for that work.53<br>
The answer lay in the creation of special modification centers. Beginning in January 1942, the air force began opening such centers, relying at first on the maintenance shops of commercial airlines for facilities. By July, when Knudsen arrived at Willow Run, twelve centers were in operation; ultimately the number reached twenty-eight, although all of them never operated at the same time. In all the government spent $100 million on twenty-one of the centers, eighteen of which worked exclusively on air force planes as opposed to navy or foreign aircraft. But it took time to get the centers up and running, and other problems continued to plague Willow Run.54”

“One survey showed that it was nearly impossible to rent a room within fifty miles of Detroit. New housing was needed on a massive scale.

“The opportunities were there. The West had space, resources, and a fresh supply of hydroelectric power to propel plants. Although not yet fully online, the three great western dams alone—Grand Coulee, Bonneville, and Shasta—could provide 39 percent of the nation’s potential hydroelectric power. “These dams,” admitted the administrator of the Grand Coulee and Bonneville, “are a frank subsidy.” The government built them to help develop thinly settled regions, and they were about to pay enormous dividends because of the war. Two new integrated steel plants, the first in the West, arrived by different routes. The government financed the Geneva Works of a U.S. Steel subsidiary in Utah, while Henry Kaiser, after a dogged fight to gain approval for his plans, had to borrow more than $100 million to build his steel mill at Fontana, fifty miles from Los Angeles.6”

“With the war boom came drastic cultural upheavals. Apart from the immediate problems of housing, sewage, transportation, water, and other needs, cities and towns underwent profound adjustments to the waves of men—and women—filling their streets at all hours, some in uniforms, others in work-clothes. California’s birth rate soared to record heights; in San Francisco venereal disease and pregnancy rates doubled among schoolgirls; overall venereal disease shot up 75 percent in 1942 and 1943. Uniform-struck teenaged girls, known as “V-girls” or “khaki-whackies,” clustered around train depots, bus stations, drugstores, or anywhere else they might encounter soldiers or sailors, offering themselves in exchange for a date as simple as a movie or a dance. “I’m off to Walgreens to meet a girl,” said the sailor in a standing joke. “What’s her name?” he was asked. “How should I know?” he replied.10”

“Three broad crises beset the war mobilization effort, each one fueling the next. The first was the conversion of industry to wartime production. Once this was accomplished, its soaring output led directly to the second crisis, the shortage of raw materials. As that crisis eased during 1943, it aggravated a third one already under way: the manpower muddle. The first problem was chiefly one of machines, the second of materials. The third proved more intractable because it involved people and therefore became a political hot potato. “It calls for decisions from which the people and government have hitherto shrunk,” observed Fortune. “It requires voluntary and involuntary sacrifices that the people have never contemplated. The issues go beyond mere numbers. They will cut across the citizen’s social prejudices and prerogatives at every turn.”20”
</p>


<hr>

<p>
“Everyone agreed that the overall supply of people was ample. The difficulty, as Roosevelt had stressed, was having the right number of them in the right place at the right time. “What we had,” said Nelson, “was a series of acutely localized manpower shortages, in some city, or in some industry; shortages of certain skills [or] . . . trades—but never an actual over-all shortage of manpower.” Too many claimants tugged insistently at the available supply: the draft, the military, the war plants, shipyards, lumber camps, farms, mines, and a host of other, more specialized needs. Meat grew scarce in part because western ranchers could not keep their cowpunchers, fence riders, and cooks from wandering off to war plant jobs that paid $80 to $100 a week. One copper producer fell 3 million pounds behind monthly capacity because he lacked 500 miners and 300 smelter workers. Since it needed the copper for ammunition and other uses, the army found itself in the distasteful position of furloughing men back to the mines.21”
</p>


<hr>

<br>

<p>
“Farm workers posed a special and hotly controversial problem. To help draft boards determine whether a farm worker was essential to the war effort, the Department of Agriculture created a table converting every type of crop and livestock care into war units. The care of one milk or three beef cows or five yearling steers or heifers, for example, comprised one war unit. To be deferred, a worker had to be responsible for only eight war units, a figure that was raised to ten in February 1943, twelve in May, and sixteen later.”
</p>


<hr>

“At the heart of the difficulty lay an old and familiar issue: a voluntary versus compulsory policy. The American way had always been to persuade rather than coerce people to do what was needed, but it did not always work. Compulsion was inevitably associated with the dictatorships that were the enemy, yet the British had legalized absolute state control over labor early in the war and it seemed to work well for them.29”
</p>


<hr>

<br>

<p>
“The British Ministry of Labor and National Service had power to allocate manpower for both industry and the armed forces. Its decisions were based on essential needs rather than number or type of dependents and were final. Its head, Ernest Bevin, presided over all the crossroads where manpower issues converged, including agencies for mediation, arbitration, conciliation, and wages. The United States had resorted to compulsory service in only one area, the military draft, which had precedents reaching back to the Civil War. Nothing like a draft for civilian labor had been attempted, although one plan had floated about in the 1920s for what was called “universal service” and later refined to “national service.”

“Roosevelt entered the fray in February on a tangential angle with an executive order establishing a minimum forty-eight-hour workweek. Later Rosenman claimed that it operated as a check on inflation and “helped to solve serious manpower shortages in critical areas.” Although the order extended the forty-eight-hour week to all metal mining and all phases of the lumber industry, most workers remained unaffected by it. The vast majority of war industry employees already worked that many hours, and a large portion of the remaining workforce fell under a series of exemptions and exceptions contained in the regulations issued by WMC. Overall the order had little impact on the labor situation.34”

“The war posed a similar problem in that it was a temporary condition that required extraordinary but not necessarily permanent measures to meet its demands. It was this thinking that lay behind the proliferation of new agencies, much as it had with the New Deal. “It seems to me it is easier to use a new agency which is not a permanent part of the structure of government,” Roosevelt told Frances Perkins. “If it is not permanent, we don’t get bad precedents that will carry over into the days of peace. We can do anything that needs to be done and then discard the agency when the emergency is over.”

“The modest size of our staff and quarters,” said Byrnes, “effectively demonstrated our resolve not to compete with other agencies.” At the same time, he was determined to establish his authority by making it clear that his decisions carried the full weight of the president. He instructed his staff never to go to other offices for consultation, saying that the operating agencies had to bring their problems to OWM. As a first step he asked all agencies to review their procurement programs realistically and objectively. As always, the stiffest resistance came from the military, which continued its reluctance to share sensitive strategic materials with civilians.”

“In his annual budget message the president said that the United States planned to spend or lend about $109 billion in the coming year, of which he wanted $51 billion raised without borrowing. The Civil War had cost the nation $3.35 billion and World War I $35.4 billion. Obviously more money had to be raised through taxes and other sources. Inflation remained a major problem and one closely tied to taxation. On both issues members of the administration agreed strongly that they had to be dealt with but divided sharply over how best to handle them.”

“The Economic Stabilization Order of October 1942 had been issued to stop the rise in the cost of living. But by the following April prices had jumped another 6.2 percent; food prices rose 13 percent and those of fresh fruits and vegetables a whopping 58 percent. Roosevelt’s call for a national wartime forty-eight-hour workweek in February added to the inflationary pressure even though he and Byrnes insisted that increased production would offset any such influence. In this manner income rose even when base wages did not. Those working more than forty hours received time-and-a-half for the extra hours. The extra hours fattened their paychecks, giving them more disposable income to chase a dwindling supply of consumer goods and driving up prices. The nation’s war plants were already working forty-eight hours a week or more, but industry overall averaged only forty-four hours a week. At the same time, the sharp increase in munitions output reduced the supply of consumer goods, thereby adding fuel to the inflationary fires.48”

“Shortly before his departure, Henderson had issued an order for compulsory grading of canned food as a precaution against canners meeting price ceilings by cutting quality. Grade would determine price and help those families, according to John Kenneth Galbraith, who used a week’s ration stamps “for some thickened water and a few isolated vegetables.” The National Canners Association promptly unleashed a major law firm to attack the order, insisting that grade-labeling was a needless “social reform in wartime.” Brown, who had earlier endorsed the order, agreed to reconsider it. Maxon, whose clients included a major canning company, infuriated OPA men by urging repeal of the order.51”

“The disputes within OPA reflected the growing concern over how to cope with the rising tide of demands for increases in prices and wages. On February 25 the Senate had passed by overwhelming vote the Bankhead bill, which prohibited the deduction of subsidies paid to farmers from being part of the computation of parity prices. The bill was a blatant end run around an Economic Stabilization Order’s provision that included subsidy payments as part of the computation. A similar bill passed the House on March 24, and a final version landed on Roosevelt’s desk a week later. On April 2 he vetoed it as inflationary, not only raising food prices but inviting the UMW and other unions to press their demands for wage increases. The Senate returned the vetoed bill to committee, where, explained Senator John Bankhead, it would sit as a “club” to be used if Lewis got higher wages for his miners.5”

“Bedeviled by the threat of an inflationary spiral, Roosevelt resorted on April 8 to issuing an executive order to “Hold the Line” on prices and wages. On prices it stipulated that “all items affecting the cost of living are to be brought under control. No further price increases are to be sanctioned unless imperatively required by law.” Adjustments in price relationships between different commodities would be allowed if they didn’t raise the general cost of living. As to wages, no further increases in wage rates or salary scales would be permitted beyond the Little Steel formula “except where clearly necessary to correct substandards of living.” McNutt received the authority to prevent any worker from changing jobs for higher pay unless the change aided in prosecution of the war. Brown’s theory of a gradual rise in prices was sent packing.54”
