“Émile, in considering his rank in the human species and seeing himself so happily placed there, will be tempted to … attribute his happiness to his own merit.… This is the error most to be feared, because it is the most difficult to destroy.<br>
—JEAN-JACQUES ROUSSEAU, Émile”
</p>

<br>

<p>
“According to our theory, which we will present shortly, the asshole exposes a deep feature of morality that philosophers have sought to understand from the time of Jean-Jacques Rousseau to this day.5 The asshole refuses to listen to our legitimate complaints, and so he poses a challenge to the idea that we are each to be recognized as moral equals. This explains why the asshole is so bothersome, by revealing the great importance we attach to recognition in unexpected areas of our lives. In later chapters, we will suggest that a clearer understanding of this helps with asshole management. The key is to understand why we are easily tempted to fight on the asshole’s terms: we are fighting for moral recognition in his eyes.”
</p>

<br>

<p>
“We will also explore larger, more basic questions about human social life. Why are assholes mainly men? Can assholes be properly blamed? Why do some societies produce more assholes than others? Are certain styles of capitalism especially prone to asshole production and thus social decline? And, finally, can we ultimately make peace not only with the given asshole but also with a human social condition in which assholes flourish?”
</p>

<br>

<p>
“WHAT IS IT TO BE AN ASSHOLE?
</p>

<p>
Our theory is simply this: a person counts as an asshole when, and only when, he systematically allows himself to enjoy special advantages in interpersonal relations out of an entrenched sense of entitlement that immunizes him against the complaints of other people. (Because assholes are by and large men, we use the masculine pronoun “he” advisedly. We will suggest that women can be assholes as well. For the time being, think of Ann Coulter. We consider the question of gender in detail in chapter 4.)”
</p>

<br>

<p>
“Our theory thus has three main parts. In interpersonal or cooperative relations,6 the asshole:<br>
    (1) allows himself to enjoy special advantages and does so systematically;<br>
    (2) does this out of an entrenched sense of entitlement; and<br>
    (3) is immunized by his sense of entitlement against the complaints of other people.”
</p>

<br>

<p>
“An insensitive person—a mere “jerk”—might allow himself to so enjoy “special advantages” in such interpersonal relations. What distinguishes the asshole is the way he acts, the reasons that motivate him to act in an abusive and arrogant way. The asshole acts out of a firm sense that he is special, that the normal rules of conduct do not apply to him. He may not deliberately exploit interpersonal relations but simply remains willfully oblivious to normal expectations.”
</p>

<br>

<p>
“Because the asshole sets himself apart from others, he feels entirely comfortable flouting accepted social conventions, almost as a way of life. Most important, he lives this way more or less out in the open. He stands unmoved when people indignantly glare or complain. He is “immunized” against anyone who speaks up, being quite confident that he has little need to respond to questions about whether the advantages he allows himself are acceptable and fair. Indeed, he will often himself feel indignant when questions about his conduct are raised. That, from his point of view, may show that he is not getting the respect he deserves.”
</p>

<br>

<p>
“Although our theory is a definition of the term “asshole,” we should emphasize that it is not necessarily a dictionary definition. It is not necessarily a claim about how the word “asshole” is commonly used in some linguistic group (e.g., speakers of English). The word is often used loosely and variously, and we aren’t suggesting that every competent speaker of English would agree with our proposal about what the word means. We aren’t even saying that a majority of speakers would agree, in a way that might be confirmed or undermined by opinion polls or psychological experiments.”
</p>

<br>

<p>
“Instead, our approach is the one Socrates proposes to Polus in Plato’s Gorgias, when he explains why the dispute between them does not depend on opinion polls (what they call “the company”). Polus asks, “But do you not think, Socrates, that you have been sufficiently refuted, when you say that which no human being will allow? Ask the company.” Socrates replies:<br>
You must not ask me to count the suffrages of the company [.…] I shall produce one witness only of the truth of my words, and he is the person with whom I am arguing; his suffrage I know how to take; but with the many I have nothing to do, and do not even address myself to them. May I ask then whether you will answer in turn and have your words put to the proof?7”
</p>

<br>

<p>
“Our definition, in other words, is a constructive proposal. It tries to articulate what we ordinarily mean when we speak of “assholes” but ultimately stands or falls on whether it captures the importance assholes have for us—where the “us” is, in the first instance, you and me. I am proposing the definition in light of importance that assholes have for us. You decide whether you agree.8”
</p>

<br>

<p>
“Before considering the details of our theory, we will first follow philosophical practice and ask what kind of theory we are looking for. We can then “test” a given theory—including the one just stated—by considering whether it explains what we are trying to explain. This gives us a modicum of control in a messy enterprise.”
</p>

<br>

<p>
“We begin with a puzzle. Although some assholes take a staggering toll on the lives of others, many assholes are not bad in this way: the costs they impose upon other people may be moderate or small. Yet they are still clearly morally reprehensible. How could that be? Why would we be deeply bothered even by a person who makes little material difference to our lives?”
</p>

<br>

<p>
“A single courageous or magnanimous act does not make for a courageous or magnanimous person. Nor does an occasional impatient or self-absorbed or foolish act make someone into an impatient or self-absorbed or foolish person. In the same way, someone can act like an asshole—in a particular situation or over a particular day or week—without really, ultimately, being an asshole.9 When the assholish behavior doesn’t reflect the kind of person someone generally is, stably, in his life, he is better classified as a jerk, a boor, a cad, a schmuck, or a mere ass. What we want to understand, in the first instance, is the sort of person for whom assholish acts are quite in character, and indeed routine, because they do generally reflect the type of person he stably is.”
</p>

<br>

<p>
“the term “asshole” can be expressive and also pick out a real feature of persons. It would not be incoherent to say of someone, without disapproval, “He is my friend, and he is fine to me personally, but I have to admit he is an asshole.” One might wonder why someone who said this stays friends with an asshole, but the statement could be quite true and known to all: the person spoken of is, in fact, an asshole.11”
</p>

<br>

<p>
“The second thing to explain is that most assholes are not morally beyond the pale, unlike, say, a murderer, rapist, or tyrant. Most assholes are not that bad.”
</p>

<br>

<p>
“We can agree that the worst kinds of people can also be assholes, but it is not helpful to think first of people at the bottom of the moral barrel—the Hitlers, Stalins, or Mussolinis—since their corruption is wildly over-determined. As suggested earlier, the mere asshole is a clearer target of inquiry and, in any case, often not among the lowest of the low.”
</p>

<br>

<p>
“the material costs many assholes impose upon others—a longer wait in line, a snide remark, a ruined afternoon—are often by comparison moderate or very small. It would be indefensible to forcibly remove them from society. Which is of course why we are often stuck interacting with them, why they seem to be everywhere.<br>
And yet—and this is the third thing we need to explain—assholes are still repugnant people.”
</p>

<br>

<p>
“Despite the fact that the material costs they impose are often moderate or small, assholes are rightly upsetting, even morally outrageous. Something else is deeply bothersome about them, something beyond mere material costs: something bad enough to drive an otherwise coolheaded person into a fit of rage;13 something that lingers in one’s memory like a foul stench; something that warrants a name we use for a part of the body we hide in public, a part of the body that many people feel alienated from and perhaps wish wasn’t there.14 It is this bothersome “something” that we want to expose.”
</p>

<br>

<p>
“To summarize, then, our three requirements for a good theory of assholes are as follows. We are looking for (1) a stable trait of character, (2) that leads a person to impose only small or moderate material costs upon others, (3) but that nevertheless qualifies the person as morally repugnant.”

“According to our theory, the asshole does what he does out of a “sense of entitlement,” a sense of what he deserves, or is due, or has a right to. However misguided, the asshole is morally motivated. He is fundamentally different from the psychopath, who either lacks or fails to engage moral concepts, and who sees people as so many objects in the world to be manipulated at will. The asshole takes himself to be justified in enjoying special advantages from cooperative relations. Given his sense of his special standing, he claims advantages that he thinks no one can reasonably deny him. He is resentful or indignant when he feels his rights are not respected, in much the same way a fully sociable, cooperative person is.”

“Assholes and fully cooperative people simply have very different moral views of what their respective entitlements are. To bring out the difference, compare the point of view of “fully cooperative” people. Fully cooperative people, we may say, see themselves as equals, as having grounds for special treatment only in special circumstances that others will equally enjoy at the appropriate times.”

“On one’s birthday, one expects to receive special indulgences from one’s friends, such as a party, a round of drinks, or a celebratory phone call. Yet all count as equals because everyone is assigned one such day of celebration each year on or around the calendar day of each person’s birth. If you are celebrating my existence now, I will be celebrating your existence at some point during the year.<br>
The practice of forming a queue will degenerate into a scrum unless people by and large are willing to wait in the line.”

“We might generalize from these examples in the following way. In each case, there are both normal expectations and special circumstances in which those expectations are, for certain parties, to be set aside. Those who happen to wind up in the special circumstances are permitted to take special benefits, advantages, or treatment, but not because they are themselves special. All are seen as, at bottom, equals. Each will have days of special privilege, as the occasion (e.g., birthday) arises in the normal course of things. And as long as we each take special advantages for good reasons of the right kinds—there really is a grave emergency—no one will be terribly bothered about how the exact distribution of benefits and burdens falls out. We say, “It will all work out in the end,”

“if we really are working together in good faith, accommodating one another for what we can each regard as good reasons of the right sorts, that would in and of itself realize a kind of relationship we could really value, quite aside from the outcomes that fate and circumstance ultimately bring.”

“The asshole, by contrast, sees no need to wait for special circumstances to come his way in the normal course of things. The asshole feels entitled to allow himself special advantages as he pleases systematically, across a wide range of social interactions. He cuts in line, and interrupts often, and drives without particular care, and persistently highlights people’s flaws. He rides people with wearing comments—veiled criticisms, insinuating questions, or awkward allusions to topics not normally discussed in polite company. He is often rude or more often borderline nasty.”

“One feels he has just been intrusive or inconsiderate, though one can’t always pinpoint the norm of courtesy he has tread upon. Most important, the asshole gains special advantages from interpersonal relations, not by stroke of continuous luck, but because he regards himself as special. His circumstances are special in each case, in his view, because he is in them. If one is special on one’s birthday, the asshole’s birthday comes every day.”

“The witty and charming asshole, however, will get away with more than a dull asshole can. A quite different stripe of asshole shows “principled” restraint when the advantages come too easily. Taking every last advantage, without at least a slight challenge, may seem beneath him, even undignified. He may, so he says, have better, perhaps nobler things to do with his precious time. The “dignified asshole” will share our displeasure with the scrappy asshole and may even hold a special contempt for his lax and unprincipled ways. Yet the dignified asshole is not so “principled” as to forgo the systematic enjoyment of special advantages; he may simply be especially good at justifying the special advantages he takes in his own eyes, by concocting “principled” rationalizations on the fly.”

“Or consider a quite different area of life, academia. Dominic, a historian, has written some rightly acclaimed books. Having become accustomed to feeling appreciated, he now feels entitled to recognition and is especially prone to feeling slighted when he is not given a lot of attention. He finds it outrageous when his work is not cited, or when he is invited to speak at a conference but not offered the keynote address. None of this leads him to doubt whether his work is of continued importance; he instead concludes that those involved clearly lack judgment. As his prominence declines, instead of becoming increasingly uncertain about his claim to attention, he becomes increasingly concerned about the deteriorating state of his profession. In order to uphold high standards, especially as exemplified in his own work, he regularly writes scathing reviews of recent books, finding little good in them, sparing few terms of abuse, while offering slight evidence of his sweeping criticisms. When books he has trashed become prominent and influential, Dominic takes this as further evidence of falling professional standards.”

“we stipulate that there are many ways of coming to be an asshole, by coming into the appropriate “sense of entitlement.” What is crucial is that the sense of entitlement tells the asshole that he deserves, or is due, or has a right to special advantages. The reasons why he feels he deserves special treatment may be as diverse as the stars. He may be sure that he is the greatest historian, architect, actor, artist, corporate executive, or political leader seen in a long time.”

“He may feel entitled to his position of power and the control over people it enables him to exercise. When people suffer at his hand, this is simply an unfortunate fact of life—for them. He may feel that the nobility of his character, or the worthiness of his favored social cause, gives him legitimate claim to have things go his way, especially when those who present obstacles can be seen as weak, unworthy, or morally corrupt. He may find most people tediously unintelligent or dull, in contrast with his own brilliant mind and manner. He may relate to them as though doing a chore, and even congratulate himself on his heroic success in treating such unworthy people politely. These are all different ways of having the appropriate “sense of entitlement.” If we had a taxonomy of such different entitlement conceptions, we would have a taxonomy of the different species of asshole. (We make a start on that effort in chapters 2 and 3.)”

“We should emphasize that one is not an asshole simply for taking oneself to be entitled to certain things. Under the appropriate circumstances, we all have a right to be told the truth, not to be kicked or cheated, or even to receive certain special advantages from cooperative life. And one is not an asshole simply for being mistaken about what one’s entitlements are. We all make such mistakes from time to time. What makes someone an asshole is a special way of being wrong about what one’s entitlements are: the asshole’s “entrenched sense of entitlement” leads him to systematically think or assume that he has special entitlements that, from a moral point of view, he does not have. Again, that distinctive kind of error may come in very different forms. The asshole might invoke a genuine entitlement principle but misapply it to his particular situation. Or he might easily find entitlement rationalizations on the fly for whatever he happens to want at the time. In either case, the crucial feature is that the asshole’s entrenched sense of entitlement produces some such form of moral error in a systematic way. It is in that general way that the asshole[…]”

“According to our theory, whether O’Reilly counts as an asshole depends on whether he is in fact entitled to act as he acts. People can disagree about that, given their background views about his social role and its value or disvalue, without disagreeing about what it is to be an asshole generally. So both Lefty and Righty can accept our theory. Lefty can say that O’Reilly is an asshole but happily admit that this wouldn’t be so if Righty were correct that O’Reilly is entitled to do as he does (and vice versa). The same is true of the many examples discussed in chapters 2 and 3.”

“A person of good conscience might be aware of his own inner asshole and yet often successfully remind himself that his life is of no more importance than anyone else’s, that his own talents and accomplishments are largely a matter of luck, and that he is fortunate to live well and savor the sweetness of people in normal cooperative life. The asshole not only lacks such motivational correctives, his sense of entitlement is “entrenched,” in the sense that he is persistently assured, even upon reflection, that he is quite unlike everyone else. When the world questions his special standing in it, it is the challenge rather than the standing that gives way. The asshole sees no need to defend his special place in the social world, or he easily produces convincing rationalizations and moves on. He may even compliment himself on his resiliency and formidable argumentative powers. If reflection is for most people an important source of moral learning, the asshole puts reflection mainly in the service of assuring himself. This leaves him quite impervious to reform. Even when profound hardships befall him, and there is abundant therapeutic help, he will, in all likelihood, never see reason to change.16”

“There is nothing wrong in itself with enjoying the benefit of cutting to the front of a line, or of speaking out of turn, or of being freed from certain responsibilities. These actions are not, as such, wrong in the way it is wrong, say, to kill someone for the sake of fast cash. In general, the goods the asshole allows himself to enjoy flow from social practices that are generally beneficial. We ourselves admit that the asshole, too, should share in those sorts of goods, in the right measure and at the right times. The general problem is that the asshole helps himself to more than his share, or acts out of turn, or sloughs off the burdens that must generally be carried if the practices in question are to work. He can do that without doing irreparable harm or committing clear-cut wrongs. One can be a full-fledged asshole in the small.”

“This suggests that the asshole is not in any real sense an outlaw. He may well keep within the letter of the law. Nor is he just another cheater, out for a “free ride” on the cooperative efforts of others. The deeper problem is not deliberate exploitation but a kind of willful insensitivity: he sees no reason to address the ambiguities and uncertainties that inevitably arise when people interact. Even “bright-line” rules of cooperation will have exceptions, and cooperative people often have to put a certain amount of work into discerning both the spirit of the law and what is finally acceptable in a particular case. They thus seek clarification, check assumptions, ask permission, or at least take a measure of care in good faith. The asshole, by contrast, sees little need for the work of mutual restraint aimed at benefit for all involved. According to his generalized sense of entitlement, it is only right and natural that the various advantages of social life should flow his way.”

“Turn, finally, to our third requirement of explanation: that the asshole is downright upsetting, even outrageous. How could a person who imposes only small or modest costs upon others nevertheless be morally repugnant? Our answer appeals to a crucial aspect of the asshole’s entrenched sense of entitlement: it immunizes him against the complaints of other people. The asshole not only takes special privileges but refuses to listen when people complain. When someone says or conveys (as with a glare) something like “The line starts here,” “It is not your turn,” “What are you trying to say?,” or “Could you, please, let me finish,” the asshole makes no attempt to hear the person out and perhaps delivers a rude retort, such as “Screw you!” He is unwilling to recognize anyone who does express a complaint, never considering that the complaint might be legitimate. So although one may only suffer the small material cost of being cut ahead of in line, or being interrupted, or being talked over, one also suffers a deeper wrong: one’s very status as a moral person goes unrecognized. Immanuel Kant memorably says that respect for the moral law “strikes down” or “humiliates” our sense of “self[…]”

“THE IMPORTANCE OF BEING RECOGNIZED

We have suggested that the asshole is morally repugnant because, even when the material costs he imposes are small, he fails to recognize others in a fundamental, morally important way. This is the heart and soul of our account of why the asshole is so bothersome,”

“Kant would say the asshole suffers from “self-conceit” or “arrogantia.” This is supposed to be something different from mere “self-love,” which might lead to selfishness but isn’t necessarily a corruption of one’s capacities to reason morally. One can act selfishly, or even be a selfish person, despite one’s better moral judgment, perhaps by ignoring the moral situation or getting oneself not to actively consider it, much as a “jerk” or “schmuck” does. The asshole, by contrast, actively reasons from his sense of special entitlement rather than from an independent understanding of what the moral law requires when, in Kant’s terms, all are regarded equally as “ends in themselves,” as coequal sovereigns in a “Kingdom of Ends.”18”

“Here Kant is probably developing Rousseau’s distinction between a person’s natural sense of self-worth (amour de soi-même) and a potentially destructive concern for rank or status as compared to others (amour propre).19 According to Rousseau, healthy self-love does not require comparing oneself to others at all; feeling worthy does not necessarily involve feeling superior to someone. Yet we invariably and rightly do care about how we are regarded by others in our social relationships. If the way of the world is often simply to compete for status, to try to better someone, Rousseau vividly explains how this gives rise to untold personal misery and grave social ills.20”

“Even so, nothing in the human social condition per se requires status competition. Instead, Rousseau suggests, we can acknowledge each person’s need for status recognition without treating anyone as either better or worse than another; we need only recognize each as fundamentally equal. All can rest content with this solution—except, of course, the asshole. His feelings of amour propre are an unquenchable fire. He won’t settle for mere equality.21”

“Other philosophers have developed ideas of “moral status” and “mutual recognition,” most notably Fichte (e.g., on how one person’s “summons” can awaken another person into freedom and mutual regard), Hegel (on the unequal regard between master and slave), Sartre (on shame or sexual desire), and Buber (on the “I-Thou” relation we stand in to each and all Others, in contrast with the “I-It” relation we bear to mere things). Or as contemporary moral philosophers might say, in blander but perhaps clearer terms, morality is “second personal,” in at least the following way.22”

“If being a person with basic moral status means anything, it at the very least means that one is owed respect and consideration as a being endowed with capacity to reason. In particular, people are endowed with powers that enable them to consider and evaluate how someone has acted. A mountain, whale, or tree, though deserving of consideration and appreciation in its own right, lacks the range of abilities needed to question the justifiability of what others have done. The community of persons is, in this way, special.23 I, as an ordinary human person, have special powers of self-consciousness, reasoning, and judgment. I can observe someone acting, as a mere event in the order of things, but also ask (if only to myself) certain questions of justification. Why, I might ask, should an act such as that be acceptable? In particular, is such an act justifiable to me if it was done in my direction, given how it might affect me?”

“Likewise, any one of us, so endowed, can ask what would be justifiable to another person, from his or her particular point of view. Is that something she can reasonably find acceptable, given the consequences for her? Or could she reasonably complain of how she is in effect being treated? In that case, what we think another could or could not accept should have special significance for us and how we act. It will influence our choices, at least if we are at all morally concerned.”

“Each of us, in acting, has to consider not only what might make the world go better rather than worse from an impersonal point of view—factoring in the mountain, the whale, and the tree—but also what could be acceptable to each and every other one of us, for reasons arising from the different, distinctive personal standpoint of each separate person in our common world.”

“when someone does object to a particular act, with a quizzical glare or loud words, there is usually some reason to think that the person may have a reasonable complaint. Even if the objection is ultimately unreasonable, it also might have an element of truth. Accordingly, one of our basic moral responsibilities is to hear people out, to at least take seriously the reasons they give for wanting to be treated differently, even if we ultimately object. The expectation, in other words, is for us to recognize the person objecting, in something like the way a deliberative body grants someone in the room the right to speak before the group. This is, as we might put it, part and parcel of basic moral respect—that is, respect not simply for the person’s complaint but for the person who makes it.”

“The asshole, by contrast, is wholly immunized against the complaints of others. Whether or not the complaint is ultimately reasonable, the person is not registered, from the asshole’s point of view, as worthy of consideration. The person who complains is not seen as a potential source of reasonable complaint but is simply walled out. If the person complaining is “standing up for herself,” in order to be recognized, it is as though she were physically present but morally nonexistent in the asshole’s view of the world.”

“That is why otherwise coolheaded people fall into a fit of rage or lash out at the asshole: they are fighting to be recognized. They are not fighting for the small benefit of having the asshole move to the back of the line or, more generally, for a slightly more fair distribution of the benefits and burdens of cooperation. The person taking a stand against the asshole is fighting to be registered in the asshole’s point of view as morally real. She struggles not simply to be heard but to be seen. She struggles to be seen, in Thomas Nagel’s phrase, as “one among others equally real.”24”

“The fully cooperative person is accustomed to listening when people complain, and used to being heard when even a suggestion of complaint is made. That is how cooperative people normally work out what is acceptable to all, what the moral equality of each person requires. This comes to feel natural, expected, a matter of course. The asshole, by contrast, is equally accustomed to walling others out. He does it all the time. This is comfortable for him. And he is exceptionally good at it: when others complain, he easily dismisses the objection, or quickly finds convincing arguments that rationalize the objection away, and moves on. He compliments himself on how good he is at this because he is very good at it indeed.”

“Here, however, one might object that we are overmoralizing the asshole concept. Can’t someone count as an asshole but wholly lack a sense of moral entitlement? Can’t he simply be thoroughly self-absorbed, like Turnbull or Updike, or most teenagers? Can’t he simply be extremely difficult or just clueless?<br>
This line of questioning is important because our theory is a proposal about what all assholes have in common. It is a problem if some people fit our definition but do not count as assholes, or if there are true assholes our definition leaves out. Apparent counterexamples such as those just noted could well mean that we should wipe the slate clean and relax our claim that the asshole has a moral sense of entitlement—that we should de-moralize the concept. How, then, might those examples be accounted for?”

“It is of course fine to call someone an asshole when he is simply self-absorbed or extremely difficult to get along with. When someone cuts one off in traffic, one can appropriately call him an asshole without first finding out whether he did this out of entitlement (in asking at the next traffic light, it could become clear that he merely made a mistake). It makes little difference whether the driver really is, strictly speaking, properly classified as an asshole. The same might go for the difficult person. If your friend is flummoxed by his encounters with an especially difficult person, you might say, “Don’t worry about it. He’s just an asshole,” at once affirming your friend’s right to better treatment and advising that he probably should not expect the difficult person to change. These ways of calling someone an asshole seem useful and fine, even without looking further into why the person acts as he does.”

“indeed the idea of “getting to have sex with whomever one wants whenever one wants to” can be seen as a misogynistic entitlement: an unfounded entitlement to something that, from a moral point of view, must be freely offered or given, and so won’t necessarily be available as one prefers. Plato or Aristotle would regard a moral vice of character as itself undermining human happiness or flourishing, which partly just consists in virtuous living. But the point might hold even if we take the more characteristically modern view that virtue and happiness potentially come apart.”

“We might add that thorough self-absorption is in any case itself a moral failing that indicates entitlement in our sense: the self-absorbed person feels or presumes that he need take no account of others and, if asked, will often give reasons why this is justified (“I can’t do it right now,” “I’m overwhelmed,” “Can’t you see that I’ve got serious problems!”). These are potentially reasons why the person should not be asked to give others what would otherwise be their due, and how we evaluate those reasons will decide whether someone counts as an asshole. If his reasons are good enough (perhaps he is severely depressed), then he is not an asshole. Or even if the reasons given aren’t especially good, if he apologizes for his actions later, he isn’t an asshole; he is not immunized against the complaints of others in the way the asshole is.”

“On the other hand, many proper assholes tell themselves such universalistic stories without believing them deep down. They might even get themselves to really believe them mainly to keep themselves reassured. This species of asshole pays homage to morality by invoking a veneer of impartial universality, in contrast with the supremely smug asshole, who needs little more for his for justification beyond saying, “Well, it is me. How could this [pointing to himself] not deserve special treatment.” An asshole can’t simply take himself as his reason without standing outside morality altogether (making him more like a psychopath).27 But assholes can vary considerably in the degree to which they require a pretense of universality to keep themselves feeling secure.”

If one can be an asshole in the state of nature, Hobbes would regard this as fully justified self-defense. In conditions of society, by contrast, assholes are akin to Hobbes’s famous Foole, who joins the social contract but then breaks or cheats the law.”

“As psychologist Sander Koole explained (in conversation), when the therapist asks, “How do you feel?” the narcissist answers, “I feel I am not getting the respect I deserve.” While this is characteristic of narcissistic personality disorder, we are not assuming that every such person counts as an asshole. Being an asshole is probably only one version of the disorder. Even so, the near plague of narcissism in our culture might explain why there are more assholes than there used to be. We touch upon this theme at several points later.”

“Nietzsche’s Übermensch famously stands beyond conventional morality and prizes the assertion of self above all. As far as I can tell, he can be read in different ways: either as rejecting morality altogether, as endorsing the true universalistic morality of personal authenticity, or as endorsing special privileges for the few who are courageous enough to assert themselves in ways that are in principle available to all. He’s closest to the asshole in the latter reading.”

Here is one possible test: if you would be willing to call yourself an asshole, this indicates that you are not in fact one. This particular test is flawed; as we have already observed, assholes often shamelessly own the name. Better (but still imperfect) is a test of shame: whether one is at all worried by the thought that one counts as an asshole. To the extent that this thought—“An asshole? Me? Really?”—prompts a sense of shame, perhaps with a felt need to take stock and reflect, one probably, to that extent, is not an asshole. (It is fine if you feel a sudden temporary thrill in the idea of transgression or special powers—as one might, for instance, in the thought of bearing Plato’s ring of Gyges, which makes its wearer invisible and so able to avoid accountability.2 If you’d feel shame in the idea of actually going through with the transgressions, though, you’re probably in the clear.)”

“Of necessity, most people are not assholes, since a critical mass of cooperators is required if there are to be special advantages for the asshole to take. And yet most people have little difficulty singling assholes out.”

“Our theory requires that the asshole be mistakenly entrenched in entitlement, but it is otherwise neutral about what sort of error he is making; he can be wrong about what he is entitled to in any number of ways for any number of reasons. It is thus an open question what the different styles of assholes are. This allows us to respect Aristotle’s wise maxim that we should not expect precision from a theory beyond what its subject matter will bear. If poetry is not math, neither is virtue and vice. Still less so is the fluid variety of asshole vices. We thus proceed inductively, as Aristotle might. We examine an array of exemplars in hope that different asshole kinds will emerge.”

“Henry senses the sovereignty of another man’s conscience and mind and so to some extent appreciates the boundaries of respectful entreaty. He then flies through those boundaries—only to again feel their force as something beyond his powers. Henry was accustomed to getting what he wanted and felt he had every right to bully More into changing his mind. But he also respected More and wanted an honest change of mind, something even a king cannot summon by his mere command.”

“THE PRESIDENTIAL ASSHOLE
</p>

<p>
If the asshole king is something of a limiting case, the asshole boss of the workplace stands at the other end of a spectrum: his role is often fairly well defined. Between these poles stand most heads of state. We do not any longer accord unchecked power to our leaders. Yet there remains considerable latitude for interpretation of what high office puts within one’s rightful power. The presidential asshole goes beyond what is, morally speaking, within his rights.”

“The man is not an asshole, and indeed something of an antiasshole. For many progressives, this is a problem, as we can see from their objections: he pulls back in using the powers he clearly has; he fails to respond to the opposition, allowing it to define the debate; he is too eager to listen, to understand, so as not to offend, to the point of being dragged away from his convictions by people stubborn in theirs; he makes preemptive concessions in approaching the bargaining table and then further concessions down the line; he favors compromised policies that absorb everyone’s concerns and do much less good than they could. In short, progressives wish Obama could behave a lot more like an asshole.20 Yet it is not clear—at least not as yet (campaign season aside)—that Obama is willing, or even able, to do that. He just may not be that kind of guy.21”

“As much as or more than anyone, Gingrich created the United States’ polarized political climate. As Speaker of the House, he ordered Republican lawmakers to stay home much of the week in order to avoid forming bipartisan relationships and a sense of common cause with Democrats, and he championed the strategy of seeking to dominate Democrats even at the expense of things both parties agree about. These are asshole moves—things an asshole would do—to the extent we think legislators are obligated to address common problems, especially where they can agree, in which case they are not entitled to put politics first and last. Many will disagree with that moral assessment and so take a more favorable view of Gingrich’s political tactics, and indeed the use of certain tactics alone would not make Gingrich, the man, an asshole per se.”

“He is an asshole, however, if he does such things out of a misguided sense that he has encompassing rights to them. Or as he puts it, in his own words: “I think you can write a psychological profile of me that says I found a way to immerse my insecurities in a cause large enough to justify whatever I wanted it to.”22”

“THE CORPORATE ASSHOLE
</p>

<p>
Although the argument from culture won’t help Berlusconi, it nevertheless does contain a general insight: the asshole in power is shaped by his position and its culture as much as he shapes it. Much as with our ordinary asshole boss, assholes may wind up in power, not simply because assholes are especially prone to seek it out but because the position induces a creeping sense of entitlement in those who come to occupy the role.”

“It is said that power corrupts. We may add that it brings out the inner asshole, by deadening one’s capacities of empathy and understanding, telling one there is no need to listen, and beckoning one into egocentricism and easy rationalization of ever-widening privileges. The asshole boss simply settles into a firm sense that “I’m the boss,” which gradually becomes a firm sense that “I’m the man” in traffic, at the post office, and at his child’s soccer game.25”

“The mark of the psychopath, as we will understand him, is to have forsworn, or perhaps never fully acquired, the use of moral concepts (perhaps because of childhood abuse).28 The psychopath merely feigns moral action, usually to create the trust needed to effectively manipulate others. The asshole, by contrast, traffics in and is moved by moral justification—except that moral justification, for him, leads to an entrenched sense of special entitlement. He gets upset precisely because he feels entitled to special advantage, especially, he’ll say, in light of the good he does. Thus Steve Jobs’s knowledge of how much people love his gadgets could potentially explain why he felt entitled to park in handicapped spaces, skimp on philanthropic giving,29 and intentionally hurt his associates.”

“As Jobs’s best friend, Jony Ive, explains, “when he’s very frustrated … his way to achieve catharsis is to hurt somebody. And I think he feels he has a liberty and license to do that. The normal rules of social engagement, he feels, don’t apply to him.”30”

“This moral sensibility makes all the difference for how assholes could emerge in boardrooms and grow in numbers over time. Psychopaths are not typically guided by social expectations. They see expectations not as potential moral commands but as mere regular patterns of behavior, as among so many billiard balls shifting around, that provide obstacles or opportunities for self-interested action. People are, in effect, regarded as mere things. Because psychopaths are unresponsive to expectations, a culture of expectations, as it evolves over time, will probably fail to affect the overall population of psychopaths.”

“As we will see further in chapter 6, however, the asshole’s reasoning is shaped by the moral justifications his surrounding culture makes available to him. And so corporate culture can influence both net asshole production and the quality of whatever assholes get made.”

“Depending on the culture, then, an asshole can be better behaved or worse behaved than a psychopath. A healthy culture of corporate responsibility—to employee, consumer, and investor alike—can significantly limit how far an asshole will go in, say, firing workers to maximize both quarterly returns for investors and his personal compensation. In such a culture, even a proper asshole might not ruthlessly institute mass layoffs, let alone take pleasure in the exercise of power.”

“At the same time, a different, perhaps ultracompetitive culture might unleash the asshole within. That would, for example, explain a recent study at the Swiss University of St. Gallen that tested egotism and the readiness to cooperate of stock traders as compared to psychopaths. In computer simulations and intelligence tests, the share traders behaved more recklessly and were more manipulative than the psychopaths. They showed a special concern for competitive dominance. As study coauthor Thomas Noll explained, “It was most important to the traders to get more than their opponents.… They spent a lot of energy trying to damage their opponents.” As Noll elaborates, it was as though their neighbor had the same car, and “they took after it with a baseball bat so they could look better themselves.”31 The ultracompetitive stock trading ethos, it seems, was carried over into how the traders played laboratory games. And would anyone be surprised to see it crop up elsewhere?”

“Accordingly, once the right (or the wrong) culture settles in, the asshole population can expand. Consider, for instance, the expectation that corporations are required to maximize shareholder value, because they have a “fiduciary duty to investors.” If this is really a duty only to investors, it follows that there is a duty to minimize benefits, overall, to consumers and workers—that is to say, a duty to offer the bare minimum incentive required to get them to buy a product or show up to work. Many corporate heads will pull back from this, sensing that something is amiss. (Perhaps they ask: Isn’t the rising tide of capitalism supposed to lift all boats and not just investor yachts?) The asshole CEO will embrace his duty with moral gusto, sensing an otherwise forbidden rush of power and profits lying ahead. (Thus even Chainsaw Al might not be a psychopath but simply a raging asshole.) Others who are not already assholes will nevertheless get comfortable with this behavior, trying to keep up with or beat the pack”

“As this is repeated across thousands of boardrooms and CEO offices, being steadily reinforced with oft-repeated suggestions of how all this works to the “greater good,” assholes grow and flower. The way of the asshole can thus become the normal way.”

“But might this mean that, eventually, the asshole concept does not apply? Once enough people are doing something, it becomes a form of cooperation with the established way of doing things, not a breach of cooperative expectations. Should we say, then, that bankers, for example, are not assholes but simply good businessmen? Not necessarily. We suggest why when we examine the delusional asshole in chapter 3.”

“THE RECKLESS ASSHOLE
</p>

<p>
While many assholes shaped by their enabling cultures will push their entitlements only so far, others go a long way in the direction of the psychopath in terms of their lack of concern for great injury to life and limb and yet without wholly abandoning moral concern. An asshole in power may be reckless in the face of obviously grave risks precisely because he finds easy comfort in a sense of entitlement afforded by his larger moral cause. He may be culpably overconfident in his judgment about when his cause is best served, and so not especially circumspect about risks being imposed upon others.”
