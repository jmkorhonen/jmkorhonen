<h2>Catastrophe in original Greek: unexpected reversal</h2>

<br>

<p>
"There will never be a catastrophe free society, but it <i>is</i> possible to have a society in which catastrophes are kept to a necessary minimum, thus reverting the signification of the word itself back to its original Greek connotations of "an <i>unexpected</i> reversal," rather than an expected daily occurence.

<h2>Books abt technology in the abstract begin to appear in the 1930s</h2>

<br>

<p>
Apparently, the decade of the 1930s was the point at which this took place, for it wasn’t until then that books written about technology in the abstract began to appear, beginning with Oswald Spengler’s Man and Technics in 1931<br>
2 and Lewis Mumford’s Technics and Civilization in 1934.3 Heidegger’s famous essay “The Question Concerning Technology” was first<br>
delivered in its earliest form as one of his Bremen Lectures of 1949, while<br>
Marshall McLuhan’s The Mechanical Bride soon followed in 1951.4 Jacques Ellul’s Technological Society, furthermore, appeared in its original French version in 1954,5 while the later books of McLuhan, such as Understanding<br>
Media, soon followed.6

<h2>Toynbee pointed out that disintegrating society loses its command of environment</h2>

<br>

<p>
It was Arnold Toynbee, furthermore, who, in his monumental A Study<br>
of History, pointed out back in the 1930s that one of the conspicuous signs<br>
of a disintegrating society is a slow, gradual loss of command of its ability<br>
to control its environment.7 A decreasing technical and artistic ability, he<br>
insisted, was one of the symptoms—though not the cause—of the breakdown of a civilization.
</p>

<p>
The great civilizations have each had their own particular stylistic bias; that is, like human individuals, they all did one thing better than the others. For the Egyptians, this was their elaborate articulation of the rituals<br>
and technologies associated with the Afterlife; for the Greeks, it was a keen aesthetic sensibility; for the Hindus, a superior religious development; for the Mesopotamians, an advanced hydraulic civilization based upon an<br>
extremely complex irrigation system; and for the West, it has been a machinic specialization evident from as early as the stirrups and iron horseshoes of the fifth century.
</p>

<p>
Consistent with this logic, then, a breakdown in one or the other of these areas of expertise in their respective civilizations should be an unfailing marker that the society in question had reached the limits of its mortality, and was beginning to enter the initial stages of its senescence. And indeed, when one surveys the evidence, this does appear to be the case.<br>
In ancient Egypt, for instance, a gradual loss of competence in the technical abilities attending the mortuary practices of its ancient cults becomes evident around the period of the 22nd Dynasty, in which the elaborate imagery associated with tomb decoration begins to disappear.<br>
13<br>
<u>Coffins become shoddier and shoddier</u> from this point on and by the 25th Dynasty, the famous canopic jars were artistically inferior as well. By this point, the Egyptians were even beginning to forget their own traditions,<br>
for the two jars associated with the falcon, Qebehsenuef, and the jackal,<br>
Duamutef, were confused and inverted such that the jackal became associated with Qebehsenuef and the falcon with Duamutef.8
</p>

<p>
It was the great Near Eastern scholar Thorkild Jacobsen, furthermore, who noticed that the shift in Mesopotamia from the homeland of the<br>
Sumerians in the south near the Persian Gulf, to the north with the coming of the Babylonians, and then even further north with the Assyrians, <u>paralleled a gradual depletion and exhaustion of arable soils along the banks of the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers. Jacobsen suspected that this shift was not accidental but mapped out the slow, inevitable salinization of the soils due to the failing Mesopotamian irrigation</u> system. The shifting of each<br>
Mesopotamian kingdom further and further north was symptomatic of its<br>
southern neighbors’ gradual loss of command over their land, as their<br>
canals silted up, and their soils became ruined by salt.9<br>
<u>In ancient India, a gradual loss of command over the religious sphere</u><br>
begins to become evident from about the twelfth century on, where a certain sugary sweetness appears first in Jayadeva’s Gita Govinda and then<br>
with the gradual rise and spread of the sentimentality of the bhakti cults<br>
with their Krishna avatars and circling gopis.10 The sophistication of yoga<br>
and philosophy slowly gave way to the kitsch of folk art and popular piety.<br>
And i<u>n Classical civilization, as is well known, the decline in Greek</u><br>
<u>sculpture and statuary</u> that began to set in from the Hellenistic period was<br>
tantamount to the rise of melodrama, realism and bombast—first evident<br>
in the “Wagnerian” art of Pergamene—which became slowly rigidified and<br>
calcined until, with the severe and imposing Roman portrait busts, this<br>
great art came to its end But these, of course, are only some of the most conspicuous examples<br>
of the phenomenon. We need only think of a few others—the loss of the<br>
<u>Hinayana Buddhist control over the great irrigation tanks on the island of</u><br>
<u>Ceylon</u>; the loss of the ability of the Polynesians of Easter Island to create<br>
their stone statues, which had become legend already by the time of Captain Cook’s arrival in the eighteenth century; or the ghostly, dust-blown<br>
ruins of desert oasis cities like Petra and Palmyra—in order to remind<br>
ourselves that the phenomenon is not at all a rare one, for every civilization<br>
is mortal and all eventually lose their ability to shape and command Form

<h2>Once windmills and clocks brought a Third Age</h2>

<br>

<p>
Once, long ago, at the dawning of Western civilization, its creaking<br>
windmills and chiming clocks shone with a kind of divine aura to the<br>
Gothic monks who brought them into being as revelations of a whole new<br>
age, a Third Age, that is, of the Holy Spirit—as articulated by Joachim<br>
of Flora—during which the Spirit would descend to earth and reveal a<br>
New macro-order of world history to those initiated into the secrets of the<br>
Machine and its inner workings.

<h2>"Paleomodernity": from Industrial Revolution to about 1939, -&gt; "neomodernity"</h2>

<br>

<h3>Bauman &amp; Beck, "1st &amp; 2nd modernity"; "liquid modernity"</h3>

<br>

<p>
Paleomodernity is a name which I have given to that phase of modernity which begins around the time of the Industrial Revolution and lasts<br>
down to about the outbreak of World War II, at which point this epoch gives way to what I have called Neomodernity.  It is a wholly unoriginal<br>
designation that parallels the distinctions made by the European sociologists Ulrich Beck and Zygmunt Bauman, who call the two epochs “first<br>
and second modernity” in Beck’s case, and “heavy and light modernity” in Bauman’s. Bauman has characterized heavy modernity in his various<br>
books as an age of massive engineering projects, center—periphery models<br>
in industry and the economy, the building and extension of nation states<br>
into empires and general cultural stability all around. Light modernity, by<br>
contrast, or, as he usually calls it, Liquid Modernity, is an age in which<br>
the nation state is in process of disintegration and massive engineering<br>
projects have given way to the microworld of the small and the ever smaller<br>
in the realm of electronics, quantum mechanics and genetic engineering.<br>
Liquid Modernity, moreover, as the designation implies, is a time in which<br>
change is happening so fast that nothing can ever crystallize into shape<br>
and take any kind of lasting form for very long. Individuals, in such an<br>
age, can no longer expect to work one job all their lives but must be constantly prepared to adapt and adjust to new and different jobs which, every<br>
day, render old skills obsolete. Truths and knowledge, in such an age, are<br>
changing so rapidly that it is scarcely an exaggeration to say, as Bauman<br>
does, that what is considered “true” today may not be so any longer when<br>
one wakes up tomorrow morning. It is an age, in other words, of cultural<br>
meltdown and disintegration.
