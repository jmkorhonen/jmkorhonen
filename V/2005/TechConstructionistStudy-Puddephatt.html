Puddephatt, A. J. (2005). Mead Has Never Been Modern: Using Meadian Theory to Extend the Constructionist Study of Technology. <i>Social Epistemology,</i> 19(4), 357–380. doi:10.1080/02691720500145571
</p>

<br>
<br>

<p>
357
</p>

<p>
- uses theoretical framework of George Herbert Mead to extend the parameters of the constructionist study of technology<br>
- which suffers from two weaknesses:<br>
- its perspective is based on dualist ontology, which tends toward a solipsistic position<br>
- constructionist approach is sociologically deterministic, and fails to fully capture innovation and creativity in the technological process<br>
- Mead's ontology can serve to remedy these issues as his theory of meaning rests on a non-dualist foundation
</p>

<p>
- in a special edition of Social Epistemology, asking hot we can tehoretically enrich or extend the traditional SCOT approach<br>
358<br>
- Mead is seldom associated with the technology literature and did not write anything explicit on the topic<br>
- wrote on philosophy of science
</p>

<p>
The SCOT paradigm centrally emphasizes the mediation of technological change by social forces, over and above the supposed "objective" and "logical" necessities defined by the "material nature" of the particular technological artefacts in question. <br>
- successful in explaining the rise, redirection and continuation of various technological developments in light of their surrounding organizational, institutional, and societal contexts
</p>

<p>
- constructionist paradigm for technology studies is largely dualist in nature: social communities are almost seen to exist independently of the material world as actors forge their ideas, desires, and interests<br>
- then these socialised actors (eg technologists) set about to observe, label and cast meanings onto the (passively construed) material environment, in the form of science or technology<br>
359<br>
- second, SCOT approach fails to theorize properly innovation in technological development<br>
- SCOT tends to account for technological change with regards to the social "backdrop" of socialized actors who develop, accept or reject the artefact(s) in question<br>
- this eliminates the possibility of capturing true innovation as a wholly unpredictable and emergent event
</p>

<p>
- the author borrows from Mead for non-dualist framework for social studies of technology:<br>
- for Mead human consciousness cannot be separated from the material environment any more than it can be separated from the social world<br>
- TRIFOLD MATRIX of interaction: meaning generation encompasses not only other humans but also material objects
</p>

<p>
*This theoretical grounding will open the way for future dialogical studies of scientific or technological knowledge, enabling researchers to study how people communicate with and learn from the objects and environments they engage with through the temporal social process. *
</p>

<p>
- shows how Mead's "I" and "Me" concepts, his focus on temporality, and his notion of "emergence" in the generation of meaning allow for a more thorough analysis of novelty, and thus a better conception of innovation in the technological process
</p>

<p>
##Dualism in SCOT
</p>

<p>
360
</p>

<p>
- Note 17 criticizes SCOT for tending towards idealism, in which material and technical considerations have been moved from the primary point of analysis to a distant second (Bunge, Mario. 1999. The sociology-philosophy connection. New Jersey: Transaction Publishers; Hacking, Ian. 1999. The social construction of what? Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press; Latour, Bruno. 1993. We have never been modern (translated by Catherine Porter). USA: Harvester Wheatsheaf and the President and Fellows of Harvard College.
</p>

<p>
- Critics argue that a purely SCOT view leads to a relativist position, and does not leave much room to explain science's great successes, technological advances, instrumental effectiveness and practical applications in the wider community (see Sokal, Alan, and Jean Bricmont. 1998. Fashionable nonsense: Postmodern intellectuals’ abuse of science. New York: Picador; Sismondo, Sergio. 1996. Science without myth: on constructions, reality and social knowledge. New York: SUNY Press)<br>
- technologist view and sociology view both attempt to purify the social from the technological change, and then either discard it or privilege it<br>
- this is a fundamental flaw because meaning is generated in socio-material dialogue<br>
- social studies of science and technology have shown that there are no such things as pure objects or pure subjects, but only "hybrids" or "quasi objects." <br>
361<br>
- as a response, ANT argues for analysis of what Latour calls the "middle kingdom" of scientific and technological development<br>
- asking how claims and artefacts are constructed in localized "collectives"<br>
- Latourian ANT rightly insists on studying the mediation of humans and non-humans, but there is no conceptual foundation with which to do this<br>
- the author believes that Mead has a lot to offer in this regard
</p>

<p>
- Definition of technology: Prus and Mitchell (27) purposely define technology without the inclusion of materialist terms. Prus, Robert, and Richard G. Mitchell 1999. Engaging technology: A research agenda for examining people’s experiences with enabling devices. Paper Presented at the American Socio- logical Association Meetings, August 1999. Chicago, IL.
</p>

<p>
Rather, borrowing from the Greek notion of *technè*, they include such things as language and ideas in their definition of technology just as they would telephones, computers, and the like. Thus, technology is <br>
362<br>
defined as those things (material or otherwise) that "enable people to do things." 
</p>

<p>
- Sterne (Sterne, Jonathon. 2003. Bourdieu, technique, and technology. Cultural Studies 17(3): 367–89.) also tries to avoid the difficulties of imposing a materialist definition of technology, drawing on the social theory of Bourdieu<br>
- He argues that technology is better seen as a form of cultural expression, to emerge from social groups in the same way as would so-called "pure" ideas. The link here is that the materiality or immateriality of the technology in question has little or no effect on the general social process that brings it about, or for its use (or neglect) by the public. As such, the attempt to define technology in materialist terms offers little to a generic understanding of the social process of technological development and change. 
</p>

<p>
364
</p>

<br>

<p>
...by locating reality in the present "here and now" of ongoing socio-material activity, Mead both avoids a dualist system of thought, and effectively sidesteps longstanding metaphysical problems that assume an impossible separation of consciousness, activity, and materiality.
</p>

<p>
...
</p>

<p>
If we extend Mead's more holistic suppositions, the boundaries of the mind and the body no longer need to be rigidly defined. By allowing the mind to be defined as an open entity that extends into the environment beyond conventional boundaries, we are allowed a new viewpoint with which to view and analyze various instances of perceptive practice. 
</p>

<p>
- the author hopes that Mead's theory of perceptual activity provides a starting point for demystification and better conceptualizations of the exchanges that take place in the Latourian "middle kingdom" of socio-material interchange.
</p>

<p>
365
</p>

<p>
- Mead makes an important distinction between habitualized adjustment through contact experience with the environment - "trial and error" - and the higher level, "self reflective" process of intelligent interaction.
</p>

<p>
...
</p>

<p>
366
</p>

<p>
"INTERACTIONALIST BASIS FOR STUDYING TECHNOLOGY"
</p>

<p>
Rather than taking the arrogant view that we are the creators and users of technology, and as such have some special power over it, we can take more seriously the socializing effect of technology in the human life world. How do people adapt to, and develop routines in tandem with, the introduction of new technological artefacts in their lives? Perhaps more importantly, how is the very design and development of t<br>
367<br>
technology mediated and shaped through the active responses to human action provided by the material artifacts?
</p>

<p>
...
</p>

<p>
##The Problem of Innovation in SCOT
</p>

<p>
- SCOT privileges the social and this disqualifies the unexpected occurences that may be contributed by the "agency" of material entities in artefactual design, research and construction<br>
- SCOT approaches sociological determinism: if technological advancement cannot be explained with social organization, human interests, or particular social practices, it must be because we don't know enough of the relevant "sociological" factors in place<br>
- technology portrayed as an "explainable" (via post-hoc theorizing) material expression of a given social group<br>
- technological growth is considered a natural offshoot of the relevant social milieu that creates and consumes it<br>
368<br>
- SCOT supposedly precludes a deterministic prediction of technological innovation as there are multiple routes to the same (socially malleable) end. <br>
- but why some particular branch of development is chosen over another? SCOT explains that to happen because of the so-called relevant social forces, whatever these are deemed to be. <br>
- HOXNOTE: post hoc reasoning danger<br>
- BUT: as Heidegger argued that the essence of technological development represents "aletheia" or a "revealing" of previously hidden "presences," and since these revealings were previously hidden, it follows that they could not possibly be predicted by prior material or social antecedents<br>
- HOXNOTE: but is technological development really that unpredictable?
</p>

<p>
369
</p>

<p>
##Mead's Theory of Novelty
</p>

<p>
370
</p>

<p>
372
</p>

<p>
##Conclusion
</p>

<p>
It is necessary to view technology as the fusion of the subjective social and material world in the form of artefactual constructs.
