Friedman, B. M. (2005). <i>The moral consequences of economic growth.</i> New York: Knopf.
</p>

<p>
\cite{Friedman2005}
</p>

<br>

<p>
To be sustainable is fashion
</p>

<p>
- consider: if people derive satisfaction from comparing their circumstances to benchmarks that are still recent enough to be meaningful
</p>

<p>
- in the past, this has been achieved through economic growth, and in particular increased use of raw materials
</p>

<p>
- but this may not be possible any longer
</p>

<p>
- yet people still want something to change
</p>

<p>
- but what is changing yet with little impact for overall resource use?
</p>

<p>
FASHION
</p>

<p>
Friedman (2005:83): Only if growth and change persist will people continue to feel better off
</p>

<p>
86
</p>

<p>
- in societies where prospects for economic growth seem so remote that people believe it is possible to get ahead only by taking advantage of others, moral and legal impediments to individual efforts to achieve economic or social advancement abound - in the absence of any concept of potential growth, even the accumulation of wealth frum the productive use of capital is often an object of suspicion - usury and sumptuary laws were common before the Industrial Revolution gave people the idea that economic growth was possible
</p>

<p>
By contrast, under robust economic growth the fundamental asymmetry 87 between "more" and "less" takes on reduced importance because, for most people, downward mobility - should that be someone's lot - does not mean "less" but merely not as much "more" as they might otherwise enjoy. Over a far broader range of income distribution, therefore, people in agrowing economy will be willing to accept enhanced mobility, and they are willing to accept measures like anti-discrimination laws, or special education programs for children from low-income families, designed to make actual mobility greater.
</p>

<p>
88
</p>

<p>
- Amartya Sen pointed out that although physical well-being increases with nutritiion over a fairly wide range, in fact people can survive with very little nutrition. Hence "there is difficulty in drawing a line somewhere, and the so-called 'minimum nutritional requirements' have an inherent arbitrariness." (note 29)
</p>

<p>
91
</p>

<p>
- two measures/benchmarks people use to assess their current standard of living: 1. are they (or do they feel) moving ahead compared to their past experiences? 2. are they getting ahead of other people? - THESE ARE OFTEN SUBSTITUTES FOR EACH OTHER. If people feel they're moving ahead, they are less likely to compare themselves to other people.
</p>

<p>
92
</p>

<p>
Economic growth satisfies the form of people's aspirations for "more" that *is* possible for everyone to fulfill. ...
</p>

<p>
When an economy stagnates, however, the importance people attach to living better than others against whom they naturally compoare themselves is more intense. The fact they cannot do so, or at least on average cannot, then takes on heightened importance in their eyes. The resulting frustration generates intolerance, ungenerosity, and resistance to greater openness to individual opportunity. It also erodes people's willingness to trust one another, which in turn is a key prerequisite for successful democracy. (note 59)
</p>

<p>
Mobility, either economic or social, is inherently threatening because it means the possibility of movement either up or, more to the point, down, compared to the prevailing norms for the society as a whole. But when the average income in an economy is stagnant, people who allow others to get ahead of them are not only falling behind in relative terms but also losing ground compared to their own past living standard. They lose out from the perspective of both benchmarks.
</p>

<p>
94
</p>

<p>
- it would seem that those on the top have the most to lose if something changes and therefore would be most active at resisting increases in mobility - but it is actually more often people in the lower half of the income distribution, not the very poor but semiskilled workers and struggling small proprietors, who react most defensively when an economy stagnates - why??? - one explanation: people with lower incomes are closer to the level at which a significant decline in their economic circumstances would seriously threaten their way of life or, in the days before widely available government assistance, perhaps even their survival - they may have lower probability of moving down in a mobile society, but consequences for them would be disastrous - another explanation: people in higher-income groups do not have just higher incomes, but they have usually more control over their lives and personal circumstances, including influence and authority in the social as well as political spheres. They therefore have different ways of defending their position in a stagnant economy.
</p>

<p>
95
</p>

<p>
- sometimes even the anxiety created by the risk of not keeping up can be so great as to make greater opportunity for advancement seem like misfortune rather than an advantage - well-known illustration is the case of soldiers serving in the Army Air Corps during WW2: they enjoyed significantly greater opportunities for promotion than those serving as MPs, but MPs reported they were more contentwith their promotion prospects - a plausible interpretation: <b>when prospects are sufficiently widespread, people stop asking what is so special about the fortunate few who get ahead and instead wonder what is wrong with those who don't</b> - under these circumstances, fear of failing becomes the dominant attitude 96
</p>

<p>
- Tocqueville argued that the ease with which commoners could obtain a title to nobility in pre-revolutionary France did nothing to reduce the dislike of the nobility by their "inferiors," and instead had just the opposite effect: their envy intensified their sense of being unfairly treated - argued that this resulted to more animosity toward the recent creations than towards the old nobility
</p>

<p>
101
</p>

<p>
- World Values Surveys reveal that there was a sharp difference in attitudes of people who had reached young adulthood before and after WW2. In all 6 western European countries surveyed in 1970, people who had grown up in the depressed conditions cared more about goals like maintaining a high rate of economic growth than did those who had come of age during the widespread prosperity of the 1960s. Correspondingly, the younger generation ranked goals like protecting free speech much higher than did the older generation. 102 ..
</p>

<p>
Subsequent surveys through the 1990s showed that the difference first identified in 1970 was not just a one-time phenomenon associated with the cataclysm of the World War II. From year to year, people's attitudes do change depending upon their country's most recent economic growth performance and, even more so, how fast prices are rising. But the differences in attitudes between one age group and another - those who reached young adulthood in the 1930s versus the 1950s, or in the 1950s versus the 1970s - have persisted over time. (Further, the differences in attitudes between the old rate of economic growth since World War II has been greater and the gap between the prewar and postwar experience is therefore more striking.) The clear implication is that people take on certain basic attitudes in young adulthood, depending in large part on the economic conditinons that they experience in these formative years, and then largely retain those attitudes throughout the remainder of their lives.
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
- novels by William Dean Howells (1880-90s) "how the spirit of commercialism had stolen insidously upon us, and the infernal impulse of competition had embroled us in a perpetual warfare of interests, developing the worst passions of our nature and teaching us to trick and betray and destroy one another in the strife for money..."
</p>

<p>
"How can a businessman whose prosperity, whose earthly salvation, necessarily lies in the adversity of someone else, be delicate and chivalrous, or even honest?"
</p>

<p>
120
</p>

<p>
- evidence for economic circumstances being influential in the Southern US states racial discrimination: although Confederate states regained full political independence in 1879, "Jim Crow" laws and other discriminatory policies, e.g. voting laws, were adopted only in 1890s; this coincides with what was, until that time, the most pronounced period of economic stagnation experienced in the US - black-white conflict prevented poor blacks and whites from working together, and left southern political power mostly in the hands of the white elite
</p>

<p>
182
</p>

<p>
- fears of "secular stagnation" and exhaustion of growth potential in the period after the WW2 - prominent economists like Alvin Hansen and Lauchlin Currie argued America had become "mature economy" no longer capable of achieving sustained expansion (note 3)
</p>

<p>
210
</p>

<p>
...a transition from economic stagnation to rising incomes 211 does not immediately produce new social attitudes, nor, even more so, new public policy. Only with time do individuals realize that a lasting improvement has occurred, and it takes moer time still for their renewed sense of security and eased frustration to shape popular views on social relations and national objectives. The shifting influence within political coalitions that produces new legislation typically follows yet later.
</p>

<p>
HOXNOTE: this may be changing as recessions follow each other in more rapid cycles; there is no time for "relief" to occur
</p>

<p>
HOXNOTE: see p 395
</p>

<p>
Sustainability should perhaps be understood as political/systemic, not as material or "renewable" resource sufficiency. Unless system works towards sustainability goals and fairness, not sustainable. Also: scarcity mitigation is not about material sufficiency, it's about
</p>

<p>
politics of fairness - philosophy of sustainability based on Rawlsian ethics
