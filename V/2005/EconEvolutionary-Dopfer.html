461<br>
Ch. 14: Perspectives on technological evolution<br>
- scholars of cultural change are explicitly arguing the elements of culture they're analyzing are subject to evolutionary processes<br>
By "culture," I mean to include both customary ways of doing things and ways of understanding and explaining what the right thing to do is, and why. In most of the arenas I have in mind these two aspects go together; that is, a body of practice is supported by a body of argument rationalizing that practice.<br>
By an "evolutionary process" I mean one in which the processes of change involve mechanisms that "select on" an extant variety; there are forces that sustain the character of what is selected, but there are also mechanisms that introduce new departures to the evolutionary system in question. To argue that change occurs through an evolutionary process in the sense above does not deny or even play down the importance of human purposes, thinking - and even calculating - in guiding action. ... However, the argument that change is evolutionary does deny the capability of humans to foresee fully the consequences of the actions they take, and does highlight that learning is, to a considerable extent, the result of processes that involve trials and feedback from the results of those trials.

<h3>EVOLUTIONARY EPISTEMOLOGY:</h3>

<p>
At least some of its founders views the growth of distinctly human knowledge as a natural, if very human, extension of biological evolution.<br>
- Donald Campbell (1960, 1974) played a prominent role in developing this line of argument<br>
- this strand of theorizing has played a significant role in the evolutionary analysis of technological change
</p>

<p>
The notion that science evolves has a long tradition: <br>
- with recent writing drawing somewhat conflicting themes from Popper1968 on one hand, and<br>
- Kuhn1970 on the other (see e.g. Plotkin1982, Hull1988)
</p>

<p>
The argument that law evolves has a long tradition, but less coherent<br>
- see e.g. Demsetz1967, Landes&amp;Posner1987<br>
- Chandler1962, Chandler1990 puts forward an evolutionary theory of business organization<br>
463<br>
In evolutionary economics:<br>
- the strand by Nelson&amp;Winter1982 is focused on the key role of technological advance in driving economic growth
</p>

<p>
- there seems to be a broad adherence that cultural evolution often takes place at several different levels: new business practices or new materials may be spreading at the same time within a particular business unit, across different SBUs, across the firms in the industry and across industries.
</p>

<p>
- Nelson argues here that an important feature of many aspects of human culture, and most certainly technology, is that what evolves is both a body of practice and a body of understanding<br>
Yet it can be argued that what makes the evolution of human practice, and especially technology, different from the evolution of animal behaviour as studied by ethologists is exactly that extant human practice is generally supported by a rather elaborate body of reasons, or rationalizations<br>
- "extant human practice tends to be supported or rationalized by a body of understanding or belief"<br>
- this holds for many aspects of human culture, from religion to business practice to technology<br>
However, it can be argued that a hallmark of technology that makes it different from, say, religion or certain areas of business policy is that actual practice often provides a sharp testing of prevailing understanding.
</p>

<p>
463
</p>

<p>
- rapid advance of technology (at least in some areas) differentiates it from many other evolving things
</p>

<p>
I would propose there are two related major causes [for the comparatively rapid advance of technology]... One is that the understanding part of technology often provides relatively strong guidance regarding how to improve practice. Put another way, the mechanism generating "new departures" in technological evolution is more likely to come up with new variants that are significant improvements over what previously existed than is the case, say, with respect to new business practice.<br>
The argument here certainly is not that technologists can clearly see the exact nature of the new departures that will solve a perceived problem, or make a desired improvement<br>
- see Vincenti1994; study of competition among various ideas as to how to reduce the drag on aircraft caused by fixed landing gears<br>
Indeed, a hallmakr of evolutionary theories of technological change is precisely that significant advances cannot be planned ex ante. 
</p>

<p>
However, compare what we know about how new technology comes into existence with what is revealed by the litearature on "business fads."<br>
- Abrahamson1996 discussed ideas that led to the rise, and - for a while - the fashionability, of "quality circles" 
</p>

<p>
The second feature of technological evolution that should be highlighted is that selection criteria and mechanisms are often sharp, steady, and rapid. Studies such as those by Vincenti1990 and Vincenti1994 show that it often takes a considerable period of time before a consensus judgment is made regarding the merits of competing technologes. However, the sharpness and speed of the selection criteria and mechanisms revealed in the technological histories with which I am familiar are striking compared with the vague, shifting and slow processes of selection involved in many areas of business practice, or the law. 
</p>

<p>
465
</p>

<p>
Differing views on selection criteria and mechanisms
</p>

<p>
One can identify basically three different intellectual camps of scholars working at present to develop and support the theory that "technology evolves"<br>
<ol type="1" start="1">
<li>Historians of technology</li>
</ol>
- Basalla1988 and Vincenti1990<br>
- for this group, the proposition that technology evolves is basically a theory that seems to explain the phenomena they are observing<br>
- however, once that evolutionary theory is adopted there is a natural inclination to join intellectual forces with the evolutionary epistemologists, such as Campbell<br>
<ol type="1" start="2">
<li>Contemporary sociologists studying technology</li>
</ol>
- "social construction" theory of technological advance is a recent development<br>
- Bijker1995 a good spokesman for this latter group<br>
<ol type="1" start="3">
<li>Economists studying technological advance, who have come to see the process as an evolutionary one</li>
</ol>
- by and large (although there are exceptions), the economists proposing that technology "evolves" are operating somewhat at odds with the canons of mainline economics<br>
- nonetheless, they tend to be thought of by members of other camps as "thinking like economists"
</p>

<p>
- these differences show up strikingly in the treatment by the different camps of the processes involved in the selection or winnowing out of technological alternatives:
</p>

<p>
...[E]volutionary epistemologists tend to have it in mind that the evolutionary process is mostly about getting a better fit between understanding and reality (which, however, cannot be completely experienced), while the economists tend to focus on how well a technology fits user needs, with the technological historians and the sociologists sometimes going back and forth between these aspects.
</p>

<p>
- how the different camps see selection at the community or user level?
</p>

<p>
- historians of technology: multiple possible solutions tend to exist for most important technological problems, and discovering that which works best can be determined only through actual competitive comparison.<br>
466<br>
- the adoption of evolutionary epistemology perspective commits to a view that attempts to solve technological problems are, to some extent, "blind."<br>
- the flavour of this kind of theoretizing is that technology "gets better" over time<br>
- the sociologists tend to attack this point of view: sociologists tend to agree that some sort of "community" s involved, but they see the community as much broader than simply that of "technologists."<br>
- the notion of natural, compelling "technological criteria" is emphatically denied<br>
- rather, the selection process is seen partly as the battling of competing interests, and partly as a matter of campaigns of varying effectiveness to capture hearts and minds<br>
- criteria of merit are established in these processes - they do not come from pre-existing and "natural" set of performance criteria<br>
- social constructionists take issue with both
</p>

<p>
in short:<br>
- historians: there are natural technological standards<br>
- economists: there is a market "out there" that is ultimately doing the selecting; have a distinct set of users in the theory, this set is distinct from the community of technologists and other internal actors<br>
- sociologists: no natural criteria
</p>

<p>
Evolutionary theories of technological advance in economics<br>
- represent the coming together of two strands; one from Schumpeter &amp; co<br>
- they see competition in many industries as largely involving the introduction to the market of new products by different frms, with the fate of the firms depending to a considerable degree on how well their new product sells in competition with other products<br>
467<br>
- the other strand represents the growing awareness that technological advance, in fact, does seem to proceed through a process in which there is variation, systemic selection, and then further introduction of new variety<br>
- together, these elements led to a theory that is mostly concerned with the practice aspect of technology,<br>
- presumes users and the market select on new technologies<br>
- better techs win out<br>
- the market (selecting) and the technological community (advancing the technology) are distinct!
</p>

<p>
...[O]ne could say that all scholars of the evolution of technology recognize that, ultimately, a new technology has to be accepted by those who will use it. The technological historians tend to see technologists making their judgments as agents for the users. The social constructionists see user needs as being defined by a political process, which often has some of the characteristics of a bandwagon. Economists, at least in their first cuts at an analysis, see the users knowing what they want and ultimately enforcing their choices. 
</p>

<p>
- Nelson's personal view is strongly towards the presumption that the selection environment is often reasonably sharp and steady, and that in most - if not all - arenas of technological change selection criteria reflect both technological effectiveness and user needs. However, he believes that different theories are applicable in different arenas.<br>
468<br>
- there's a big difference whether the focus is on the practice or the understanding aspect of technology.
</p>

<p>
<ol type="1" start="3">
<li>Technology as both practice and understanding</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
- if a theory of ETTC focuses strictly on practice, it naturally points its analysis of selection towards how well technology meets user needs<br>
- if technology is seen also as a body of understanding, the nature of evaluation and selection processes becomes more complicated:<br>
- the criteria for selection in body of practice may well be "fit" with user needs<br>
- for the body of understanding, it's more "the ability to explain observed relevant facts and enable problems to be solved and progress made."<br>
The selection processes and those who control them, as well as the criteria, may be very different. <br>
- for practice, the process is ultimately under the control of users, or their agents<br>
- for understanding, control rests with the community of technologists<br>
- there may or may not be some overlap
</p>

<p>
If the user community is diverse, or there are many different kinds of uses, selection may preserve a wide variety of artefacts and techniques. On the other hand, the body of understanding that is the result of selection may be quite unified.<br>
If both aspects are recognized, it would seem that technological advance needs to be understood as a coevolutionary process. The managers in which the two aspects evolve, and how they relate to each other, all would seem essential aspects of the story. And these processes would appear to differ significantly from field to field.<br>
One central variable is the strength of technological understanding at any time. Another is the knowledge of the technological community regarding user needs, or its ability to control or define them. If both are very strong, technological advance can almost be planned. This seems to be the presumption behind at least some aspects of technology policy, public and private. However, empirical scholars of technological<br>
469<br>
change can cite many examples of disaster when these conditions were, incorrectly, assumed to hold. In general, they do not. Attempts to develop new and better artefacts and practical techniques almost always involve significant elements of technological or user response uncertainty - usually both. <br>
Another key set of variables relates to the sources of new understanding, the relationships between the processes through which these are won, and the processes that create new practice. Until recently, and even in many fields at the present time, the principal source of understanding is experience with practice. Thus, a hallmark of much "inventing" until recently was that those who used or operated a technology were the most likely sources of improvements in that technology. Understanding was largely a body of lore shared by those who practiced a trade. <br>
- of course, nowadays many technologies are understood "scientifically."<br>
- engineering sciences are bodies of understanding in their own right, although they draw on more basic science
</p>

<p>
... [W]hile conventional wisdom often presumes that advances in understanding come before and enable advances in practice, scholars of technological advance know that often it is the other way around, ro that the process is strongly interactive. <br>
- examples: thermodynamics came after the steam engine<br>
- Shockley's theory of holes and electrons in semiconductors as a result of the successful invention of the transistor (see Nelson1962)<br>
