<h2>2020 !!! A circular economy within the planetary boundaries: Towards a resource-based, systemic approach</h2>

Abstract<br>
Circular Economy (CE) is the buzzword of today, promising an economy able to prosper on limited resources by closing material cycles. However, <b>there is no guarantee that simple strategies of material cycling, as propagated by the various definitions of this concept, will indeed lead to an economy able to manage the world's resources, pollution and societal demand within environmentally sustainable levels</b>. Based on the shortcomings of the present mainstream definitions of CE, <b>this paper proposes an integrative, cascading, resource-based approach aimed at an environmentally sustainable and socially beneficial economy</b>. The international community agrees on the necessity to maintain the current environmental equilibrium to ensure equity for future generations and to allow human well-being and dignity already in the present. Accordingly, <b>physical and environmental limitations are identified, that are to be observed to make CE sustainable.</b> This paper then suggests that a transition towards a sustainable resource-based CE goes hand in hand with a paradigm shift in the way environmental considerations are perceived by individuals, codified in different normative frameworks and dealt with by private companies. It therefore opens the discussion by underlying some challenges that could appear in the view of transitioning to CE.

<p>
Abstract<br>
Copper is an essential element for electric vehicle (EV). Currently, little efforts have been directed toward understanding the EV-copper-resource-environment nexus. Autoregressive integrated moving average model combined with dynamic material flow analysis was developed for the nexus analysis in Fujian in China due to its vigorous EV promotion. Results showed that standardized passenger vehicle ownership would increase 3.34 times from 2018 to the peak year 2042, with about 12 times’ and 139 times’ increase of EV sales in baseline and aggressive scenarios respectively. Accordingly, EV-induced additional copper demand in Fujian would increase the same times as EV sales since 2018, leading to the expansion of copper processing that would incur increasing ripple effects, including 1) aggressive scenario's accumulative additional copper ore demand during 2013-2050 exceed 40 times Chinese reserve in 2016; 2) about 62% of on-road EV's CO2eq reduction compared with Fuel vehicle would be offset by CO2 emissions from baseline scenario's additional copper processing under Chinese power structure in 2018. Additionally, many other pollutants will also increasingly be emitted in response to the growing EV-induced additional materials’ processing, which can further extend ripple effects from local to global environment, and finally threaten global sustainability. The ripple effects indicated the importance of pyramid tip product catalog pedigree to promote international cooperation in products’ lifecycle management and extend cleaner production to cleaner consumption, efficient fleet cleaner production technologies, longer products’ lifespan, circular design, and cleaner power supply.

Abstract<br>
Electrification of future transport sector is important to reduce direct greenhouse gas emissions and the burden on fossil fuels. The modern clean energy technologies, such as electric vehicles (EVs), contain a number of hi-tech electronics and other components that depend on a wide range of metals for their functioning. A transition to large-scale deployment of such technologies might be constrained by the limited availability of these metals in future. <b>This study is aimed at resource criticality assessment for passenger EVs, where three main scenarios are modelled considering future demand of EVs in five geographic regions by 2050. The focus metals are aluminium (Al), cobalt (Co), copper (Cu), iron (Fe), lithium (Li), manganese (Mn), nickel (Ni), and the two rare earth elements (REEs): neodymium (Nd) and dysprosium (Dy)</b>. The scenario results show an increase in total number of EVs from 1.13 billion in 2011 to 2.6 billion in the baseline scenario, 2.55 billion in the moderate scenario, and 2.25 billion in the stringent scenario by 2050. The geological reserves of cobalt, lithium and nickel seem to face higher pressure resulting from increasing demand of these metals by EVs’ batteries. Whereas, the geopolitical supply risk factor becomes important in case of REEs due to existing market concentration. Recycling and technology substitution at various levels seem to reduce the vulnerability of EVs to increasing geological and geopolitical supply risk of metals.

Abstract<br>
Our societies rely on the quality and availability of natural resources. Driven by population growth, economic development, and innovation, future demand for natural resources is expected to further increase in coming decades. Raw materials will be an important part of society’s future material mix as countries increasingly transition towards resource-efficient and greenhouse-gas neutral economies. Raw materials are also fundamental to meet ecological and socio-economic targets within the UN Sustainable Development Agenda. For instance, they have a fundamental role in renewable energy technologies, new building materials and infrastructure, communication systems, and low-carbon transportation. However, some materials are largely supplied from countries with poor governance. The future availability of these materials and associated impacts are of increasing concern going forward. Recent raw material criticality studies have explored economic, geo-political, and technological factors that affect materials’ supply. However, environmental and social pressures also play a role in their security of supply. For instance, conflicts can prevent access to mineral deposits; accidents and environmental damage compromise public acceptance and can hinder future extraction operations. This article will introduce this Special Issue with a focus on material requirements and responsible sourcing of materials for a low-carbon society, and provides an overview of the subsequent research papers

Abstract<br>
Critical metals are technologically vital to the functionality of various emerging technologies, yet they have a potentially unstable supply. This condition calls for strategic planning based on the expected long-term demand and supply of these metals and the implications attached. Here, we provide the first systematic review of studies (88 studies in all) exploring the projected long-term status of various critical materials, covering 48 elements with 546 data points for global demand through 2030 and 2050. <b>Interestingly, results indicate that, to date, no long-term demand outlook is available for some high criticality metals</b>. We also find that the social and environmental implications induced by demand growth are largely overlooked in these studies, resulting in less attention being given to the spatial divergence between consuming and producing countries in the global supply chain. Moreover, <b>circular economy strategies that include component reuse and remanufacturing have been barely incorporated into the modelling frameworks presented in these studies, while end-of-life recycling is heavily focused on. In addition, elemental linkages (e.g., indium-zinc-steel) are underemphasized, leading to a lack of understanding of future availability and sustainable cycles.</b> All of these findings affirm <b>the need for further scientific research that explores the long-term status of critical metals</b>, which strongly connects to the sustainable development goals of the United Nations and implementation of the Paris Agreement.

</p>

<p>
Abstract<br>
The social license to operate (SLO) is an informal social contract that aims to bridge the gap among the views of the most important stakeholders involved in mining activities. The novelty of this paper lies in the fact that it discusses the current situation and the future prospects of granting a SLO, mainly at the European Union (EU) level, by considering the mine of the future, in terms of deep sea and landfill mining, and the criticality of raw materials that are required by high tech products as well as by emerging and green technologies. Also, it highlights the factors that may affect the views of all involved stakeholders, focusing on the joint efforts that are required by the industry and the society as well as on the main technological, social, political and legal issues which are relevant to the process. It is believed that if trust is developed between the involved stakeholders the SLO may prove an important tool in future mining in order to safeguard the supply of raw materials, minimize the environmental footprint and improve the quality of life in the affected regions. Finally, a conceptual flowsheet involving the main steps that may be followed for granting a SLO is proposed.

The Na-O2 battery has emerged as an energy-efficient and low-cost alternative to Li-O2 batteries. Relying on reversible superoxide chemistry, Na-O2 cells exhibit lower charging overpotential compared with their Li counterparts, which can be translated to high cycling performance.

Sodium superoxide (NaO2) has been detected as the major discharge product of the cell in ether-based electrolytes, which can deliver a theoretical energy density of 1105 Wh kg−1. The decomposition reaction of the obtained NaO2 on charge requires a small overpotential (charging is generally performed below 3 V vs Na/Na+), which reduces the risk of oxidative decomposition of the other cell components.

<p>
Sodium–oxygen (Na-O2) batteries are considered a higher-energy-efficiency alternative to the lithium–oxygen (Li-O2) system. The reversible superoxide electrochemistry governing the oxygen reduction and evolution reactions in Na-O2 cells results in a relatively lower charging overpotential. Thus, significant research attention has been directed toward Na-O2 in the hope of developing a high-energy-storage system. <b>This review provides a brief overview of the most recent research progress in this field with special emphasis on the chemical and electrochemical reaction mechanisms.</b> All major components of the cell including the positive and negative electrodes as well as the electrolyte are covered. Moreover, areas requiring more research attention are specified and potential directions for future research are proposed.

Abstract<br>
The integrated systems dynamics model <b>WORLD6 was used to assess long-term supply of stainless steel to society with consideration of the available extractable amount of raw materials</b>. This was done handling four metals simultaneously (iron, chromium, manganese, nickel). <b>We assessed amounts of stainless steel that can be produced in response to demand and for how long, considering the supply of the alloying metals manganese, chromium and nickel. The extractable amounts of nickel are modest, and this puts a limit on how much stainless steel of different qualities can be produced.</b> The simulations indicate that <b>nickel is the key element for stainless steel</b> production, and the issue of scarcity or not depends on how well the nickel supply and recycling systems are managed. The study shows that <b>there is a significant risk that the stainless steel production will reach its maximum capacity around 2055 and slowly decline after that.</b> The model indicates that stainless steel of the type containing Mn–Cr–Ni will have a production peak in about 2040, and the production will decline after 2045 because of nickel supply limitations. Production rates of metals like cobalt, molybdenum, tantalum or vanadium are too small to be viable substitutes for the missing nickel. These metals are limiting on their own as important ingredients for super-alloys and specialty steels and other technological applications. With increased stainless steel price because of scarcity, we may expect recycling to go up and soften the decline somewhat. <b>At recycling degrees above 80%, the supply of nickel, chromium and manganese will be sufficient for several centuries.</b>

Clean energy technologies have been developed to address the pressing global issue of climate change; however, the functionality of many of these technologies relies on materials that are considered critical. Critical materials are those that have potential vulnerability to supply disruption. <b>In this paper, critical material intensity data from academic articles, government reports, and industry publications are aggregated and presented in a variety of functional units,</b> which vary based on the application of each technology. The clean energy production technologies of <b>gas turbines, direct drive wind turbines, and three types of solar photovoltaics (silicon, CdTe, and CIGS); the low emission mobility technologies of proton exchange membrane fuel cells, permanent-magnet-containing motors, and both nickel metal hydride and Li-ion batteries; and, the energy-efficient lighting devices (CFL, LFL, and LED bulbs) are analyzed.</b> To further explore the role of critical materials in addressing climate change, emissions savings units are also provided to illustrate the potential for greenhouse gas emission reductions per mass of critical material in each of the clean energy production technologies.

Dynamic material flow-stock model and seven energy scenarios are used, combined with material scenarios. Results indicates that most critical metals for energy system are Te, Cr, Ag, Ni, In, Ge, Tb, and Dy, however, technology advancements are expected to reduce risks associated with Ag, In, Dy, and Tb. Energy scenarios are difficult to realize without adequate supply of metals from primary sources, combined with increasing resources efficiency, recycling, and careful selection of technologies. Energy models used to produce these scenarios should include energy-material nexus. <b>Biggest global implications expected for Ge, Te, Tb, and Dy.</b>

<p>
Abstract<br>
Amid present concerns over a potential scarcity of critical elements and raw materials that are essential for modern technology, including those for low-carbon energy production, a survey of the present situation, and how it may unfold both in the immediate and the longer term, appears warranted. For elements such as indium, current recycling rates are woefully low, and although a far more effective recycling programme is necessary for most materials, it is likely that a full-scale inauguration of a global renewable energy system will require substitution of many scarcer elements by more Earth-abundant material alternatives. Currently, however, it is fossil fuels that are needed to process them, and many putative Earth-abundant material technologies are insufficiently close to the level of commercial viability required to begin to supplant their fossil fuel equivalents “necessarily rapidly and at scale”. As part of a significant expansion of renewable energy production, it will be necessary to recycle elements from wind turbines and solar panels (especially thin-film cells). The interconnected nature of particular materials, for example, cadmium, gallium, germanium, indium and tellurium, all mainly being recovered from the production of zinc, aluminium and copper, and helium from natural gas, means that the availability of such ‘hitchhiker’ elements is a function of the reserve size and production rate of the primary (or ‘attractor’) material. Even for those elements that are relatively abundant on Earth, limitations in their production rates/supply may well be experienced on a timescale of decades, and so a more efficient (reduced) use of them, coupled with effective collection and recycling strategies, should be embarked upon urgently.

Abstract<br>
The transition from a fossil fuel base to a renewable energy system relies on materials and, in particular, metals to manufacture and maintain energy conversion technologies. Supply constraints shift from fossil fuels to mineral resources. <b>We assess the availability of metal reserves and resources to build an energy system based exclusively on renewable energy technologies. A mass balance of 29 metals embodied in renewable energy technologies is compiled in order to satisfy global energy demand, based on five authoritative energy scenarios for 2050.</b> We e<b>xpand upon these scenarios by modeling the storage capacity needed to support high shares of intermittent renewables (wind and solar). The metal requirements are then compared with the current demand and proven reserves and ultimate mineable resources</b>. This allows us to distinguish between constraints related to renewable energy sources from those linked to technology mixes. The results show that proven reserves and, in specific cases, resources of several metals are insufficient to build a renewable energy system at the predicted level of global energy demand by 2050. The comparison between reserves and resources shows that <b>scarcity relates sometimes more to techno economic supply than to raw material availability</b>. Our results also highlight the importance of substitution among technologies and metals as well as the limited impact of recycling on the depletion of scarce metals

Abstract<br>
Clean energy technologies are widely recognized as a part of the solution for a sustainable future. Unfortunately, these technologies often rely on materials that are considered critical because of their importance to the technology and their potential for supply disruptions, which often lead to drastic and unexpected price spikes. With many clean energy technologies still struggling to compete economically with incumbent technologies, it is uncertain if such material price changes could have a significant economic impact on overall clean energy technology costs. <b>In this paper, we first estimate material intensity of critical materials for three case study clean energy technologies: proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells in fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs), neodymium iron boron (NdFeB) permanent magnets in direct drive wind turbines, and Li-ion batteries in battery electric vehicles (BEVs).</b> Using these data, as well as material price information, we analyze technology-level costs under potential material price spike scenarios. By benchmarking against target costs at which each technology is expected to become economically competitive relative to incumbent energy systems, <b>we evaluate the impact of price spikes on marketplace competitiveness.</b> For the three case studies, <b>technological costs could increase by between 13 and 41% if recent historical price events were to recur at current material intensities.</b> By analyzing the economic impact of material price changes on technology-level costs, we demonstrate the need for stakeholders to push for various supply risk reduction measures, which are also summarized in this paper.

Abstract<br>
<b>A new methodology to quantify minerals’ criticalities is proposed—the criticality systems of minerals.</b> In this methodology, <b>four types of agents —mineral suppliers, consumers, regulators of the market, and others, such as the communities near mining operations—interact with each other through three types of indicators : constraints , such as the political stability in the mining regions, the mineral's substitutability and economic importance; agents’ interactions , such as buyer–seller bargaining; and interactive variables , such as the demand, supply, and price</b>. When the criticality systems of two mineral groups are constructed, analyses that compare the indicators of these criticality systems can determine which group is more critical than the other. This methodology allows evaluation of criticality in a dynamic and systemic manner.

Abstract<br>
Wind energy is key to addressing the global climate challenge, but its development is subject to potential constraints of finite primary materials. <b>Prior studies on material demand forecasting of wind power development are often limited to a few materials and with low technological resolution, thus hindering a comprehensive understanding of the impact of microengineering parameters on the resource implications of wind energy. In this study, we developed a component-by-component and stock-driven prospective material flow analysis model and used bottom-up data on engineering parameters and wind power capacities to characterize the materials demand and secondary supply potentials</b> of wind energy development in Denmark, a pioneering and leading country in wind power. <b>We also explicitly addressed the uncertainties in the prospective modeling by the means of statistical estimation and sensitivity analysis methods.</b> Our results reveal increasing challenges of materials provision and end-of-life (EoL) management in Denmark’s ambitious transition toward 100% renewable energy in the next decades. Harnessing potential secondary resource supply from EoL and extending lifetime could curtail the primary material demand, but they could not fully alleviate the material supply risk. Such a model framework that considers bottom-up engineering parameters with increased precision could be applied to other emerging technologies and help reveal synergies and trade-offs of relevant resource, energy, and climate strategies in the future renewable energy and climate transition.

<h2>2019 Solving the plastic problem: From cradle to grave, to reincarnation</h2>

Abstract
</p>

<p>
Plastic packaging accounts for 36% of all plastics made, but amounts to 47% of all plastic waste; 90% of all plastic items are used once and then discarded, which corresponds to around 50% of the total mass of plastics manufactured. Evidence for the ubiquity of microplastic pollution is accumulating rapidly, and wherever such material is sought, it seems to be found. Thus, microplastics have been identified in Arctic ice, the air, food and drinking water, soils, rivers, aquifers, remote maintain regions, glaciers, the oceans and ocean sediments, including waters and deep sea sediments around Antarctica, and within the deepest marine trenches of the Earth. They have also been detected in the bodies of animals, including humans, and as being passed along the hierarchy of food chains, up to marine top predators. Evidence has also been presented that microplastics are able to cross different life stages of mosquito that use different habitats – larva (feeding) to pupa (non-feeding) to adult terrestrial (flying) – and therefore can be spread from aquatic systems by flying insects. The so-called ‘missing plastic problem’ appears to be, in part, due to limitations in sampling methods, that is, many of the very small microplastic particles may simply escape capture in the trawl nets that are typically employed to collect them, but have been evidenced in grab-sampling experiments. Moreover, it is simply not possible to measure entirely through the vast, oceanic volumes of the oceans. It can, however, be concluded with some confidence that the majority of the plastic is not located at the sea surface, and indeed, several different sinks have been proposed for microplastics, including the sea floor and sediments, the ocean column itself, ice sheets, glaciers and soils. The treatment of land with sewage sludge is also thought to make a significant contribution of microplastics to soil. A substantial amount of airborne microparticulate pollution is created by the abrasion of tyres on road surfaces (and other ‘non-exhaust’ sources), meaning that even electric vehicles are not ‘clean’ in this regard, despite their elimination of tailpipe PM2.5 and PM10 emissions. The emergence of nanoplastics in the environment poses a new set of potential threats, although any impacts on human health are not yet known, save, as indicated from model studies. While improved design, manufacture, collection, reuse, repurposing and reprocessing/recycling of plastic items are necessary, overwhelmingly, a curbing in the use of plastic materials in the first place is demanded, particularly from single-use packaging. However, plastic pollution is just one element in the overall matrix of a changing climate (‘the world’s woes’) and must be addressed as part of an integrated consideration of how we use all resources, fossil and otherwise, and the need to change our expectations, goals and lifestyles. In this effort, the role of deglobalisation/relocalisation may prove critical: thus, food and other necessities might be produced more on the local than the global scale, with smaller inputs of fossil fuels for transportation and other purposes, water and fertilisers, along with a marked reduction in the need for plastic packaging.

Abstract<br>
The <b>concept of declining availability due to declining primary resource quality</b> has been investigated for various resource categories to try to determine the effort needed in future to either extract the resource or to treat it for intended use. <b>The concept of ‘future efforts’ due to declining primary resource quality is explored by Vieira et al. (2016, 2017). They suggest that a specific burden associated with the production of each primary material should be taken into account and that this can be done by studying the costs of production or ore requirements of the material and by projecting forward likely costs into the future.</b> For the purpose of the analysis, they employ mine cost data for 2000–2013 and reserve data published by the US Geological Survey. <b>We will argue below that this approach is not correct and, with this comment, we wish to make it clear that—contrary to what is suggested in much of the Life Cycle Assessment literature—the future efforts concept is not an established rule of natural resource extraction. For mineral resources, it is quite impossible to proceed with extraction in the ordered way that this approach suggests because nobody has a comprehensive view of the entire natural resource</b>. Secondly, <b>there is no evidence available to support the idea that extracting a mineral resource today causes a decrease in availability of that mineral tomorrow. On the contrary, the weight of evidence suggests that where declines in ore grades have been observed, they are overwhelmingly due to technology development in response to high demand and have been accompanied by increased mining efficiency and increased availability of the resource to successive generations.</b> Grade is a rather arbitrary measure since the <b>grade of mined ore ultimately has to do with the relationship of costs and revenues</b>. It is not only the technology employed which matters but also how smartly this technology is applied. Thirdly<b>, the future efforts approach entirely overlooks the potential availability of mineral materials from secondary (scrap) sources, sources which are expected to become increasingly important to mineral supply in the future.</b> Our conclusion from the discussion is that we as humans have been able to economically access ever-increasing amounts of material from often lower and lower-grade sources. <b>What is impossible to conclude from this is that the environment no longer contains any of the higher-grade sources</b>. In fact, all the available evidence suggests that higher-grade deposits are still out there. We remain critical optimists.

<p>
Abstract<br>
We present the Yale Stocks and Flows Database (YSTAFDB), which comprises most of the material stocks and flows (STAF) data generated at the Center for Industrial Ecology at Yale University since the early 2000s. These data describe material cycles, criticality, and recycling in terms of 62 elements and various engineering materials, e.g., steel, on spatial scales and timeframes ranging from cities to global and the 1800s to ca. 2013. YSTAFDB integrates this diverse collection of STAF data, previously scattered across various non-uniformly formatted electronic files, into a single data structure and file format. Here, we discuss this data structure as well as the usage and formatting of data records in YSTAFDB. YSTAFDB contains 100,000+ data records that are all situated in their systems contexts, with additional metadata included as available. YSTAFDB offers a comprehensive basis upon which STAF data can be accumulated, integrated, and exchanged, and thereby improves their accessibility. Therefore, YSTAFDB facilitates deeper understanding of sustainable materials use and management, which are key goals of contemporary sustainability science.

Abstract<br>
The need for electrical energy storage technologies (EEST) in a future energy system, based on volatile renewable energy sources is widely accepted. The still open question is which technology should be used, in particular in such applications where the implementation of different storage technologies would be possible<b>. In this study, eight different EEST were analysed</b>. The comparative life cycle assessment <b>focused on the storage of electrical excess energy from a renewable energy power plant</b>. The <b>considered EEST were lead-acid, lithium-ion, sodium-sulphur, vanadium redox flow and stationary second-life batteries.</b> In addition, <b>two power-to-gas plants storing synthetic natural gas and hydrogen in the gas grid and a new underwater compressed air energy storage were analysed.</b> The material footprint was determined by calculating the raw material input RMI and the total material requirement TMR and the carbon footprint by calculating the global warming impact GWI. All indicators were normalised per energy fed-out based on a unified energy fed-in. <b>The results show that the second-life battery has the lowest greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and material use, followed by the lithium-ion battery and the underwater compressed air energy storage</b>. Therefore, these three technologies are preferred options compared to the remaining five technologies with respect to the underlying assumptions of the study. The production phase accounts for the highest share of GHG emissions and material use for nearly all EEST. The results of a sensitivity analysis show that lifetime and storage capacity have a comparable high influence on the footprints. The GHG emissions and the material use of the power-to-gas technologies, the vanadium redox flow battery as well as the underwater compressed air energy storage decline strongly with increased storage capacity.

<h2>2018 !!! Critical Natural Resources: Challenging the Current Discourse and Proposal for a Holistic Definition</h2>

Abstract
</p>

<p>
Studies on critical natural resources have grown in number over the last decade out of concern for resource availability and its potential impacts. Nonetheless, only a handful of studies explicitly define criticality for natural resources. Through a systematic literature review, we identified four main perspectives in the descriptions of critical natural resources: (1) economic importance is overemphasized at the expense of sociocultural and ecosystem support functions of natural resources; (2) a Western perspective dominates the research discourse; (3) apart from the field of economics, the debate lacks input from social sciences; and (4), non-renewable resources are overrepresented compared to renewables. Based on the current discourse and its apparent inclinations, we propose a new definition of criticality for natural resources aligned with risk theory. We argue for the need to balance out the perspectives described above to provide decision-makers with impartial information for the sustainable management of natural resources

<h2>2018 !!! Decreasing Metal Ore Grades—Is the Fear of Resource Depletion Justified?</h2>

<p>
Abstract<br>
Metals are an essential part of modern living. Ensuring the future supply of metals is a key issue in politics, science, and economics because the available amount of mineral resources is limited. To measure the depletion of mineral resources, several indicators are used. Some of them are based on the <b>ore grade, which has been decreasing over time and is thus taken as a sign of resource exhaustion. However, does this assumption hold true? This paper shows that the development of ore grades is mainly the result of the increasing demand and the outstanding technological improvements that made mining of low grade ores profitable. The usage of ore grades as an indicator may, therefore, lead to erroneous conclusions about the safeguard objects. These are not the metals themselves, but the environment that is impacted by their extraction.</b>

Abstract<br>
Since electric vehicles (EVs) have been recognized as a technology that reduces local air pollution while improving transport energy security, they have been promoted in many countries. Yet, mainly due to their high costs, especially in the case of pure battery electric vehicles, and a lack of proper infrastructure, the use of EVs is still very limited. In this paper, some of the major barriers and the future challenges are discussed. The current problems are mainly attributed to two categories: (1) the battery performances and costs, as well as battery production including issue of material availability and (2) environmental benefits of EVs depending on the sources used for the electricity generation and their carbon intensity. The major conclusions are that (1) research and development with respect to batteries has by far the highest priority and (2) it has to be ensured that the electricity used in EVs is generated largely from renewable energy sources.

<h2>2018 Evaluation of long‐term silver supply shortage for c‐Si PV under different technological scenarios</h2>

<br>

<br>

<p>
Abstract<br>
This study focuses on quantifying supply shortage of silver for c‐Si PV over the long term (2015–2050), and measures the effects of technological uncertainties in the industry by scenario. Wherein, Hubbert theory, Weibull distribution, and intensity of demand are used to estimate silver mining supply, recycling supply, and manufacturing demand, respectively. The results show that silver supply shortage for manufacturing demand will occur from 2030. Technology improvements in the PV industry could delay when the shortage begins, but they will not prevent it, while silver supply shortage for c‐Si PV could be eliminated under the total effects scenario. Reducing dependency on silver as a raw material for c‐Si PV industry through technological progress and recycling retired panels is recommended. This study highlights the balance between natural resources and renewable energy sustainability. It benefits the PV industry's long‐term strategizing and helps policy making for long‐term silver resource sustainability.

<p>
Recommendations for Resource Managers<br>
<ul>
<li>Technological improvements in the PV industry are critical to relieve silver supply shortage in the long term and ensure sustainable installation of c‐Si PV.</li>
<li>Recycling of end‐of‐life c‐Si PV is of great importance to secure silver supply for PV manufacturers in the long term.</li>
<li>Improving silver old scrap recycling is necessary for long‐term availability of silver.</li>

<p>
Abstract<br>
In today’s global economy, sustainable resource management requires a consumption perspective of resource use and insight into actual resource use through the global supply chain. <b>The estimated global amount of used and unused extraction caused by mineral extraction of iron, copper, and nickel more than doubled from 1990 to 2013 (iron, 2.8–6.7 Pg; copper, 2.7–5.5 Pg; nickel, 0.19–0.60 Pg)</b>. By incorporating global material flow into a global link input–output model (GLIO, a hybrid multiregional IO model), we estimated the total used and unused extraction caused by iron, copper, and nickel mining induced by Japanese final demand to be 0.44, 0.52, and 0.043 Pg in 2011, respectively, equivalent to 7.1% of the total global extraction amount caused by iron mining, 11% of the amount caused by copper mining, and 10% of the amount caused by nickel mining. Whereas the <b>world extraction total caused by iron, copper, and nickel mining rapidly increased from 2005 to 2011, the extraction amount induced by Japanese final demand for the same period either stayed about the same (iron) or decreased slightly (copper, 99% of the 2005 amount; nickel, 92%).</b>

Abstract<br>
This study <b>analysed demand for 12 metals in global climate mitigation scenarios up to 2060</b> and quantified the impacts on demand of different assumptions on improvements and technological mix. Annual and cumulative demands were compared with reserves and current mining rates. The study <b>results showed that reserves are sufficient to support the total level of solar power, wind power and electric motors. Insufficient reserves may very well constrain certain sub-technologies, but substitutes that take the role of ‘back-stop’ technologies can be used instead. The exception is batteries, since lithium battery chemistries and reserves were incompatible with the scenarios analysed.</b> Batteries of moderate size, lithium-free chemistry or reserve expansion would make the transition feasible.
</p>

<p>
Choice of sub-technology (e.g. type of solar PV) had a decisive impact on demand for certain metals. <b>Perceptions that many metals are critical and scarce for renewable energy transitions appear exaggerated if a dynamic view on technological development is adopted</b>. Policy-relevant conclusions can be drawn from this, regarding e.g. the benefits of technological diversity, increasing metal intensity, recycling and integrating infrastructure and energy policies (e.g. fast chargers).

Power-to-gas and other chemicals-based storages are often suggested for energy systems with high shares of variable renewable energy. Here we study the North European power and district heat system with alternative long-term storage, the power-to-ammonia (P2A) technology. <b>Assuming fully renewable power and heat sectors and large-scale electrification of road transport, we perform simultaneous optimization of capacity investments and dispatch scheduling of wind, solar, hydro and thermal power, energy storages as well as transmission, focusing on year 2050. We find that P2A has three major roles: it provides renewable feedstock to fertilizer industry and it contributes significantly to system balancing over both time (energy storage) and space (energy transfer).</b> The marginal cost of power-based ammonia production in the studied scenarios varied between 431 and 528 €/t, which is in the range of recent ammonia prices. <b>Costs of P2A plants were dominated by electrolysis</b>. In the power and heat sector, with our cost assumptions, P2A becomes competitive compared to fossil natural gas only if gas price or CO2 emission price rises above 70 €/MWh or 200 €/tCO2.

Abstract:<br>
This research aims to assess the factors surrounding the emergence of markets with the greatest potential for rechargeable lithium battery adoption. The implications of the rise of electric vehicles and electrical energy storage are measured against lithium supply and market pricing. This was resolved by <b>reviewing all available information and comparing it with the intricacies of resources, production and recycling</b>. An analysis of price formation is also undertaken before making assumptions to enable a forecast of future market dynamics until 2030. Electric vehicles will require almost threefold the lithium produced in 2015 by the end of the period considered, with grid storage predicted to follow suit. No geological supply constraints were found, but economic scarcity is a strong possibility. Production is highly vulnerable to disruption due to concentration and the situation is exacerbated by inelastic demand. Recycling may be the most critical means of diversifying and improving supplies.

Abstract<br>
Batteries that are based on organic radical compounds possess superior charging times and discharging power capability in comparison to established electrochemical energy-storage technologies. They do not rely on metals and, hence, feature a favorable environmental impact. They furthermore offer the possibility of roll-to-roll processing through the use of different printing techniques, which enables the cost-efficient fabrication of mechanically flexible devices. In this review, organic radical batteries are presented with the focus on the hitherto developed materials and the key properties thereof, e.g., voltage, capacity, and cycle life. Furthermore, basic information, such as significant characteristics, housing approaches, and applied additives, are presented and discussed in the context of organic radical batteries.

Summary<br>
Sustained growth in lithium-ion battery (LIB) demand within the transportation sector (and the electricity sector) motivates detailed investigations of whether future raw materials supply will reconcile with resulting material requirements for these batteries. We track the metal content associated with compounds used in LIBs. <b>We find that most of the key constituents, including manganese, nickel, and natural graphite, have sufficient supply to meet the anticipated increase in demand for LIBs. There may be challenges in rapidly scaling the use of materials associated with lithium and cobalt in the short term. Due to long battery lifetimes and multiple end uses, recycling is unlikely to provide significant short-term supply. There are risks associated with the geopolitical concentrations of these elements, particularly for cobalt.</b> The lessons revealed in this work can be relevant to other industries in which the rapid growth of a materials-dependent technology disrupts the global supply of those materials.

Abstract<br>
This chapter addresses the resource nexus, a concept that has recently become quite popular. It is often framed as a water-energy-food nexus and discussed at international organisations, within infrastructure planning units and among actors on the ground concerned with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the United Nations. The chapter seeks to clarify a common understanding of what the concept entails and proposes an augmented five-node nexus, which includes materials and land. <b>We define the nexus as a set of context-specific interlinkages between critical natural resources used as inputs into socio-economic systems of provision.</b> Furthermore, we discuss how the nexus fits into the narratives of resource efficiency and eco-innovation. The chapter argues in favour of the complementary strengths of both and gives an outlook on governance options.

Abstract<br>
Considering the quest for alternative energy and transportation modes and their importance for sustainable growth, <b>this chapter examines to what extent the supply risk of rare earths poses a barrier to the increased adoption of low-carbon technologies</b>. Using secondary data collected on offshore wind turbines and electrically powered vehicles, t<b>he analysis allows a determination of actual quantities of rare earths used within their generators, electric motors, and batteries.</b> The results of this chapter <b>disprove the widespread allegation that availability risk impedes the deployment of offshore wind</b>. Contrary to this, <b>a potential supply shortage would disrupt further development of the automotive industry and its electrification.</b> Uncertainty about volatile prices and the threat of supply shortages induce manufacturers to shift from superior rare earth–intensive topologies, ultimately rendering innovation in these economically nonviable.

<h2>2016 Mineral Resource Depletion: A Coming Age of Stockpiling?</h2>

</p>

<p>
Abstract<br>
The gradual depletion of low cost (or “high grade”) mineral ores is generating increasing extractive costs and diminishing economic returns. The market reacts to this situation either with high prices, which depress demand, or with very low prices (as it is happening at present) that reduce or eliminate profits for the extractive industry, which is forced to reduce production. As a consequence, <b>it is becoming increasingly difficult to manage the remaining mineral resources in such a way to ensure a sufficient supply for the economy and to avoid price shocks originated by the vagaries of the market or by social or strategic conflicts</b>. This is particularly important for critical and rare metals, such as those needed by the electronic industry and for vital tasks such as the conversion and the transmission of electrical energy produced by renewable (e.g. photovoltaic) plants. <b>One possible reaction to these problems is stockpiling, that is keeping mineral resources stored above ground and readily available in order to provide a buffer against price and supply shocks. The present paper discusses several ways in which the market of mineral resources could evolve, in particular the concept of a “metal bank” that could be used to manage the supply of rare and sensitive minerals.</b>

<h2>2015 Geopolitical-related supply risk assessment as a complement to environmental impact assessment: the case of electric vehicles</h2>

<br>

<p>
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s11367-015-0917-4" title="https://doi.org/10.1007/s11367-015-0917-4" class="https">https://doi.org/10.1007/s11367-015-0917-4</a>
</p>

<p>
Abstract<br>
Purpose
</p>

<p>
Introducing a geopolitical-related supply risk (GeoPolRisk) into the life cycle sustainability assessment (LCSA) framework adds a criticality aspect to the current life cycle assessment (LCA) framework to more meaningfully address direct impacts on Natural Resource AoP. The weakness of resource indicators in LCA has been the topic of discussion within the life cycle community for some time. This paper presents a case study on how to proceed towards the integration of resource criticality assessment into LCA under the LCSA. The paper aims at highlighting the significance of introducing the GeoPolRisk indicator to complement and extend the established environmental LCA impact categories.<br>
Methods
</p>

<p>
A newly developed GeoPolRisk indicator proposed by Gemechu et al., J Ind Ecol (2015) was applied to metals used in the life cycle of an electric vehicle, and the results are compared with an attributional LCA of the same resources. The inventory data is based on the publication by Hawkins et al., J Ind Ecol 17:53–64 (2013), which provides a current, transparent, and detailed life cycle inventory data of a European representative first-generation battery small electric vehicle.<br>
Results and discussion
</p>

<p>
From the 14 investigated metals, copper, aluminum, and steel are the most dominant elements that pose high environmental impacts. On the other hand, magnesium and neodymium show relatively higher supply risk when geopolitical elements are considered. While, the environmental indicator results all tend to point the same hotspots which arise from the substantial use of resources in the electric vehicle’s life cycle, the GeoPolRisk highlights that there are important elements present in very small amounts but crucial to the overall LCSA. It provides a complementary sustainability dimension that can be added to conventional LCA as an important extension within LCSA.<br>
Conclusions
</p>

<p>
Resource challenges in a short-term time perspective can be better addressed by including social and geopolitical factors in addition to the conventional indicators which are based on their geological availability. This is more significant for modern technologies such as electronic devices in which critical resources contribute to important components. The case study advances the use of the GeoPolRisk assessment method but does still face certain limitations that need further elaboration; however, directions for future research are promising.

Abstract<br>
Purpose<br>
The concept of electro mobility is gaining importance and has become more dynamic in recent years, particularly in developed economies. Besides a significant reduction of mobility-related CO2 emissions, electro mobility is also expected to minimize the current dependence on oil, while maximizing energy conversion efficiency. However, the associated shift in resource requirements towards so-called strategic metals gives reason to suspect that trade-offs could threaten the desired merits of e-mobility with regard to sustainability. <b>This study aims to give a more comprehensive understanding of the challenges—including the issue of uncertainties—which the broad implementation of e-mobility could place on resource availability and especially on a sustainable management of special metals for the high voltage traction batteries forming the heart of the electric powertrain.</b>
</p>

<p>
Methods<br>
Future metal flows for three possible cathode materials containing the special metals lithium and cobalt are estimated in this paper by means of a Material Flow Analysis. Using two scenarios (dominant and pluralistic) projecting the annual demand for electric vehicles until 2050 and the free software STAN in order to perform the calculation steps to build up the model for the analysis, the MFA considers the resource input requirements based on annual vehicle registrations and the consequent energy requirements.
</p>

<p>
Results and discussion<br>
<b>The results indicate continuously rising lithium requirements with a wide variation in absolute terms depending on the scenario, which can be considered symptomatic for the uncertainty regarding the development of e-mobility. In the case of cobalt, the projected demand trajectories differ even more drastically between the two scenarios. In comparison to lithium though, for both scenarios cobalt requirements in absolute terms are much less than lithium requirements. With a view to currently known reserves, the cumulative demand for battery technology projected in the dominant scenario will consume 74–248 % (for two different cases) of the lithium reserves and 50 % of the cobalt reserves by 2050.</b>
</p>

<p>
Conclusions<br>
Despite significant differences between the examined scenarios, it becomes clear that e-mobility will be an increased driver for cobalt and particularly lithium demand in the future. Exact increases in demand for both metals are difficult to predict, especially due to the necessity of numerous assumptions, such as recycling rates, as well as data availability and quality. The results of this study imply a shift from managing primary resources, resource uses, and waste separately, towards managing materials, i.e., resource flows and their implications over the entire life cycle.

Abstract<br>
The transition to low carbon infrastructure systems required to meet climate change mitigation targets will involve an unprecedented roll-out of technologies reliant upon materials not previously widespread in infrastructure. <b>Many of these materials (including lithium and rare earth metals) are at risk of supply disruption. To ensure the future sustainability and resilience of infrastructure, circular economy policies must be crafted to manage these critical materials effectively</b>. These policies can only be effective if supported by an understanding of the material demands of infrastructure transition and what reuse and recycling options are possible given the future availability of end-of-life stocks. <b>This Article presents a novel, enhanced stocks and flows model for the dynamic assessment of material demands resulting from infrastructure transitions</b>. By including a hierarchical, nested description of infrastructure technologies, their components, and the materials they contain, this model can be used to quantify the effectiveness of recovery at both a technology remanufacturing and reuse level and a material recycling level. The model’s potential is demonstrated on a case study on the roll-out of electric vehicles in the UK forecast by UK Department of Energy and Climate Change scenarios. The results suggest policy action should be taken to ensure Li-ion battery recycling infrastructure is in place by 2025 and NdFeB motor magnets should be designed for reuse. This could result in a reduction in primary demand for lithium of 40% and neodymium of 70%.<br>

Abstract<br>
The energy infrastructure for fossil fuels is well-established, accounting for approximately 87% of the 16 TW of power consumed globally. For renewable and sustainable energy conversion technologies to play a relevant role at the terrestrial scale, they must be able to scale to the TW level of deployment. This would place a significant demand on the current and future supply of raw materials (chemical elements) used by those technologies. <b>Oftentimes, the average crustal abundance of a chemical element is cited as a measure of its scalability, however another important metric for scalability is the existence (of lack thereof) of mineable ores with a high concentration of the targeted element. This paper aims to provide an overview of the availability of all elements. This is accomplished via a compilation of data for global primary production rates for each element, as a measure of availability at the present time. This work also addresses the potential future availability based on current and possible future primary sources.</b>

<p>
Abstract<br>
Scaling up alternative energy systems to replace fossil fuels is a critical imperative. Concentrating Solar Power (CSP) is a promising solar energy technology that is growing steadily in a so far small, but commercial scale. Previous life cycle assessments (LCA) have resulted in confirmation of low environmental impact and high lifetime energy return. This work contributes an assessment of potential material restrictions for a large-scale application of CSP technology using data from an existing parabolic trough plant and one prospective state-of-the-art central tower plant. The material needs for these two CSP designs are calculated, along with the resulting demand for a high adoption (up to about 8000 TWh/yr by 2050) scenario. <b>In general, most of the materials needed for CSP are commonplace. Some CSP material needs could however become significant compared to global production. The need for nitrate salts (NaNO3 and KNO3), silver and steel alloys (Nb, Ni and Mo) in particular would be significant if CSP grows to be a major global electricity supply. The possibilities for increased extraction of these materials or substituting them in CSP design, although at a marginal cost, mean that fears of material restriction are likely unfounded.</b>

Abstract
</p>

<p>
Today we are using an enormous number of materials in an unknown variety of functionalities. Especially rare metals frequently offer essential physical and chemical properties for a variety of end-use applications. These strategic elements are only partly substitutable, and possible substitutes are very often rare metals themselves. But also dissipation is a common phenomenon for rare metals as they are often used in minor contents with no recycling potential. <b>Thinking in functionalities rather than single technologies could therefore provide better solutions for the avoidance of shortfalls by using technologies that provide the same functionality. In this chapter, the functionality of potential rare metals is described for a selection of emerging end-use sectors</b>.

Abstract
</p>

<p>
The availability of lithium resources for a transition to electric vehicles is a vital topic for transport technology strategy. Recent debate seems to have concluded that there is ‘sufficient’ lithium available, but <b>for the purposes of a technological transition, time matters. It is not simply the quantity of resource that is relevant—the flow rate into society may be a much more difficult constraint and transient events have disrupted heavily concentrated material supply chains in the past</b>. Furthermore, critical assumptions such as the presence of recycling systems may not be justified without policy support. Complacency is therefore not an appropriate stance for a robust evaluation of material risks in the case of lithium.

</p>

<p>
Abstract<br>
In order to tackle climate change, a transition to a renewable based energy system is crucial. A renewable based hydrogen economy is one of the possible implementations of such a system. The world receives ample energy from the sun that can be harvested by PV solar cells and, indirectly, by wind turbines. In order to use the most optimal locations for collecting and concentrating energy from these diffuse sources, a long distance transmission network is needed. Mature and semi-mature technologies are available for all parts of the system: from collection to transmission to end-use. In an early stage of development, when new technologies have to win market share from the existing energy system, their development is driven almost exclusively by the reduction of costs per J delivered. However, if a technology should be able to deliver tens to hundreds of EJ, resource constraints can become show stoppers. Many of the newest, most cost-efficient, energy technologies make use of scarce resources and, although they may play an important role in the transition process, they can not be scaled up the level we need for a complete transition. In most cases however other technologies are available that use more abundant materials, be it often at a cost of efficiency. The issue is not only with scarce resources. <b>The sheer size of the energy transition will also challenge the industrial capacity for the mining and production of bulk materials like steel and copper.</b>

</p>

<p>
Abstract<br>
The stabilization of future CO2 atmospheric concentrations to levels that might prevent anthropogenic alterations of the world climate calls for tens of terawatts of carbon free renewable energy resources. The combined energy production potential of all known non-solar carbon-free renewable resources seems insufficient to meet these targets. Consequently, over the next decades solar energy, and in particular photovoltaics, is expected to fill the gap.
</p>

<p>
In this work several mature photovoltaic technologies, ranging from silicon to thin films, and solar concentrator systems are analyzed. The estimates of the energy production limits are established for each technology, based on available global material reserves. It is shown that many existing technologies, albeit playing an important in the present sub-gigawatt energy production levels, are affected by severe material shortages, that would prevent their scale-up to the terawatt range. This is the case for thin film solar cells technologies based on CdTe and CIGS where the showstopper is the scarcity of tellurium and indium respectively. Despite the abundance of silicon, crystalline Si-based solar cells will hardly reach the terawatt range as additional scale-up of the technology will be impeded by the global reserves of silver, commonly used as electrode material. As for amorphous silicon and dye sensitized thin film technologies, avoiding the use of indium tin oxide transparent conductor films appears as a must for exceeding the few tenth of terawatt barrier. For existing III–V concentrator cells, operating under moderate concentration (&lt;200X), terawatt year level may be afforded by circumventing the use of Ge substrates and by minimizing the use of In and Au in the cell fabrication process.
</p>

<p>
In conclusion <b>the study summarizes current material challenges for terawatt level deployment of the existing solar cells, and for each technology, identifies improvements and innovations needed for further scale-up.</b>

Abstract
</p>

<p>
We estimate at what size electric-vehicle stocks could become constrained by metal availability by assessing metal requirement and availability for nine types of batteries: Li-polymer(V), Li-ion(Mn, Ni and Co), NaNiCl, NiMH(AB2 and AB5), NiCd and PbA, <b>that contain seven potentially scarce metals/group of metals: lithium, nickel, cobalt, vanadium, cadmium, lead and rare-earth elements.</b> We <b>assess metal intensities (kg/kW h), battery energy capacities per vehicle (kWh/vehicle), losses in recycling and manufacturing, stocks of available resources, constraints on annual mine production and competition for metals. With pessimistic assumptions for all parameters the material-constrained stocks of battery electric vehicles range from 1.1 million NiCd-battery vehicles to 350 million NaNiCl-battery vehicles. Optimistic assumptions result in estimates between 49 million (NiCd) and 12 000 million (Li-ion(Mn)) vehicles. T</b>he corresponding figures for hybrid electric vehicles are typically a factor of 10 higher. Critical factors that affect the outcome are identified.
