<h2>Introduction</h2>

<br>

<p>
In 2020, it should be obvious that long term political resolve to tackle climate change or other sustainability crises cannot be guaranteed. Nevertheless, practically all existing climate action plans envision a multi-decadal transition to a "green" society. Existing research has evaluated rapid decarbonization from a free market perspective, for instance suggesting necessary economic control measures to achieve climate targets more rapidly than usually anticipated (Rockström et al. 2017) or cautioning about complex challenges inherent in a rapid socio-technical change. Prevailing approaches are justified by a tacit assumption that societies are unwilling to make large short-term sacrifices for future well-being - even if faced by an existential threat. As a result, climate action plans tend to be more concerned about optimizing their efficiency rather than their effectiveness.
</p>

<p>
Indeed, a major problem with "slow and steady" strategies is that they are not working. The results of climate policies so far adopted are so modest that they have to be observed using advanced statistics, and even then their effectiveness is questionable, as recent disagreements about the effectiveness of the EU ETS trading system show. There is also little evidence to suggest that policy measures which would be required for the current strategies to work are ever going to be adopted. Thanks to so-called "shifting baseline syndrome," humans are adept at adapting mentally to gradually worsening circumstances, and so far no climate catastrophe has come even close to generating sufficient political will for long-term climate commitments. As one prominent commentator put it, "if we wait for ecological change to thrust itself into the consciousness of ordinary [people], we may be waiting forever" (<a href="https://www.vox.com/platform/amp/energy-and-environment/2020/7/7/21311027/covid-19-climate-change-global-warming-shifting-baselines?" title="Roberts, 2020" class="https">Roberts, 2020</a>).  
</p>

<p>
However, there may still be hope. Even if multi-decadal commitments that require coordinated action by most countries on Earth do not fit well with the psychological and political make-up of current societies, human history does contain examples of decisive action taken by societies much like ours. This paper argues that the prevailing approach should be complemented by serious planning for short-term bursts of asynchronous decarbonization. Such plans would be adopted whenever there is a political opportunity to push such plans forward, and attempt to drive down greenhouse gas emissions and advance other environmental goals as rapidly as possible. Like war mobilizations, these programs would necessarily be sub-optimal from a purely economic point of view. However, there are at least five good reasons why emergency plans should nevertheless be prepared. 
</p>

<p>
First, as crises such as the 1973 oil crisis, the 2008 financial crisis, and the COVID-19 emergency have illustrated, unexpected events can catalyze political will that could be channeled towards short-term environmental and climate action. These crises also highlight the importance of preparation: only plans and ideas that have been developed before the crisis, and are "current" among decision makers, can be adopted. 
</p>

<p>
Second, experience shows that policies that are discussed in public and then actually adopted are never more ambitious than the most ambitious plans published. Thus, one way to increase the ambition of existing plans is to publish even more ambitious plans. In particular, there is dearth of plans that could be executed in the limited time most governments have available before they are voted out of office.
</p>

<p>
Third, increasing evidence suggests that, counterintuitively, a short-term crash program might actually be a workable, economically justifiable strategy, provided that we abandon some problematic assumptions made in past climate economics research. 
</p>

<p>
Fourth, there is historical evidence that industrialized societies have been able and even willing to undergo short-term privations and redirect their productive capacities in order to defeat existential threats, whereas there is little evidence of similar changes happening in a steady manner prescribed by economic rationalities. 
</p>

<p>
Fifth, every passing day increases the likelihood that the world or major parts of it <i>have</i> to adopt some kind of a crash program to stave off the collapse of civilization. Even if that day never comes, even if existing "slow and steady" plans continue to be the basis for adopted policies, it is the responsibility of the research community to ensure that the public and the decision-makers who have to put emergency plans into action have access to the best research possible. As always, specific plans will turn out to be incorrect, but as history and recent events have repeatedly taught us, planning will be indispensable.
</p>

<p>
This paper provides a summary of evidence and argument for each of the five points introduced above. We discuss the possibilities of rapid shifts in environmental conditions and political opinion, and how crises are an opportunity for pre-existing plans only. The use of more ambitious plans to push policy ambition is then discussed. The third section of the paper goes through the economic argument, centered on the problems of existing climate economics and its approach to existential risks. The fourth section provides a brief overview of historical evidence of projects of comparable size - the industrial mobilization for the Second World War. 
</p>

<p>
After these preliminaries, we outline some possible guidelines for emergency decarbonization planning, discusses existing initiatives such as European "Plan B" project and its approach, and call for researchers, practicioners and policy makers around the world and across disciplines to collaborate on local and global emergency mitigation and adaptation plans. History has shown that even when emergency plans "work" in a sense of somehow "resolving" the emergency, the plans will always be, at best, unsatisfactory compromises that are going to ignore some valid concerns and, at worst, grossly infringe upon essential liberties. We probably cannot produce a perfect emergency plan, but we can and we should try.

<h2>Solution packages and windows of opportunity for climate action</h2>

<br>

<p>
A quote often attributed to Milton Friedman states that researchers have a duty to keep ideas alive until they can be implemented. When many issues compete for the attention of the public and the decision-makers, only the most pressing ones tend to be attended to (cf. "Garbage Can" model, Cohen et al. 1972, 2012). As a result, the window of opportunity to implement new policies often opens only as a result of a crisis. For example, the 1973 oil crisis ushered in many policies for energy efficiency and alternative energy sources, even if these policies were often abandoned later: however, without this initial impetus, the development of alternative energy sources and energy efficiency would be far less advanced today than it actually is. In contrast, there is an emerging consensus that the 2008 financial crisis did not result to substantial climate action largely because no credible plans that would've taken advantage of the opportunity existed at the time (Aronoff et al. 2019; Pettifor 2019). 
</p>

<p>
Indeed, experience has shown that governments responding to crises tend to focus on solving the issues with the techniques that are at hand when the crisis occurs (Kingdon 1995, Aberbach et al. 2002, Boin et al. 2005, Peters et al. 2011, Koickert 2012, Aberbach and Christensen 2014). If a package of ready-made solutions exists, and has strong advocates or "policy entrepreneurs", a crisis can serve as a window of opportunity for the adoption of new policies (Kingdon 1995, Aberbach et al. 2001, Aberbach and Christensen 2014). Obviously, a "solution package" that does not exist, or is hastily put together and not credible, cannot have strong advocates. Therefore, advance preparation of possible solution packages is of considerable importance.
</p>

<p>
Experience also suggests that solution packages should be specific, detailed, and limited in scope. General statements of strategy or objectives are difficult to translate to concrete policy measures in a hurry, and if this has to be attempted, the risk of unexpected consequences is high. Plans and planning that have assumed a smooth multi-decadal transition towards decarbonized society are helpful for setting the overall direction, but often useless for identifying specific policy measures that could be adopted as part of a stimulus package, for example. Furthermore, plans that assume the adoption of transnational or even global measures are far more difficult to put into action compared to regional (e.g. EU), national, or local plans. For example, while global carbon tax is a worthwhile long-term policy goal, it may be safely assumed that such negotiations will not be on agenda during national or regional economic emergencies. 
</p>

<p>
While such parochiality presents problems, particularly for climate plans that emphasize economic "efficiency", it also provides opportunities. Despite three decades of effort, global governance that economically "optimal" plans require is not forthcoming, and serious planning should no longer simply assume that e.g. global carbon tax will be instituted in the near future. Instead, climate mitigation is likely to be a more haphazard and "asynchronous" effort, where different countries and regions proceed at a differing pace. Achieving meaningful progress in this environment requires a broad spectrum of solution packages, ranging from overarching "optimal" solutions to limited, specific, and concrete local measures. To the extent possible, these measures should be designed so that they mitigate either pre-existing or crisis-caused human problems, such as unemployment or lack of infrastructure, while at the same time delivering climate and broader environmental benefits. 
</p>

<p>
Many different types of crisis could conceivably provide impetus for environmentally beneficial emergency measures. Practically all crises that result to substantial economic disruption are opportunities for stimulus packages that incorporate environmental measures. However, especially important windows of opportunity may open as a result of 1) crises that require major reconstruction efforts, and 2) crises that influence supplies, production processes, or uses that are particularly harmful to the environment. As an example of the latter, crises that result from or cause disruptions in the supply of fossil fuels should be anticipated with detailed plans how such a crisis could be used as an opportunity to reduce or even end the use of fossil fuels.

<h2>Moving the Overton window on climate policy</h2>

<br>

<p>
Policies that are adopted are selected among policies that are thought to be acceptable. The range of acceptable policies in current climate discourse is, in fact, surprisingly narrow: practically all "serious" policy discussion centers around "economically efficient" measures, such as carbon taxes. While these policies may be efficient in theory, by now it is obvious that they are not effective in practice. 
</p>

<p>
The situation can be conceptualized using the concept of "Overton Window", or window of discourse. According to this model, politicians are limited in what policy ideas they can support, and generally only pursue policies that are widely accepted throughout society as legitimate policy options (<a href="https://www.mackinac.org/OvertonWindow" title="https://www.mackinac.org/OvertonWindow" class="https">https://www.mackinac.org/OvertonWindow</a>) The window can be moved by convincing the public, i.e. voters, that policies currently outside the window should be inside it. In this manner, previously unthinkable ideas may become possible, perhaps even inevitable.
</p>

<p>
The development of more radical yet logically coherent and plausible emergency decarbonization plans can help to move the window of discussion towards more effective policies. Even if radical emergency plans are never adopted, their existence can help climate action by providing an alternative to the narrow range of multi-decadal transition plans. 
</p>

<br>

<h2>The Economic Case for Rapid Action</h2>

<br>

<p>
The prevailing climate economics orthodoxy has been underpinned by traditional cost-benefit analysis and a desire to produce as economically "efficient" climate action plans as possible. However, damage estimates and normative conclusions of "optimum" emission reduction pathways are heavily dependent upon extremely subjective value judgements (see Heal, 2017 for an overview). For instance, the question of "correct" discounting method and discount rates to use is an "essentially contested" matter (to borrow from Lukes, 1974) that cannot be decided empirically, even though the discount rate has major influence upon the results. For the purposes of this overview, perhaps the most crucial issue involves the conclusion that the optimum carbon price should start from a relatively low value and increase over time. While this conclusion has been accepted as a given for decades, emerging research has examined the problems inherent in the underlying assumptions. In their thought-provoking paper, Daniel et al. (<a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/116/42/20886" title="2019" class="https">2019</a>) <a href="..\V\2019\CO2PricePathsDeclining-Daniel.html" title="V:2019:CO2PricePathsDeclining-Daniel" class="page">V:2019:CO2PricePathsDeclining-Daniel</a>  show how simply including concerns about climate uncertainty in the calculation of carbon price turns the conclusions upside down: if uncertainty about the future is factored in, the "optimal" carbon price should start much higher than current estimates suggest, rise for a few years, and then fall steadily hundreds of years into the future. Prior approaches have essentially ignored the possibility of catastrophic loss and the benefits of reducing the risk of catastrophic outcomes, even though such risks are a key reason for climate concern.
</p>

<p>
Approaches like these point one possible way out of the crisis that could perhaps be more aligned with how humans perceive crises - not as multi-generational predicaments, but as temporary disruptions that are resolved within limited time. Just as short-term diets are far more popular than long-term lifestyle changes - despite the latter being the "correct" answer to problems like weight gain - a short-term "climate diet" could well be more palatable than an open-ended commitment to "efficient" but hitherto ineffective action. We do not know this, because we have not tried it.  
</p>

<p>
Aside from different method for valuing carbon, which is ultimately a subjective choice, there is another economic argument that supports much more decisive carbon action than hitherto seen. So far, perhaps the most important impediment slowing down climate action is the higher cost of low-carbon alternatives. However, there are proven ways to reduce the cost of technological products. Generally the most effective of these is true mass production.
</p>

<p>
That larger production volumes mean smaller - sometimes much smaller - costs per unit produced is a generally accepted and empirically well supported axiom. In the climate field, the remarkable developments in the prices of solar photovoltaics (PVs) are largely attributable to the simple fact of larger manufacturing volumes (e.g. Nemet and Husmann, 2012, find that 43 percent of cost reductions between 1979 and 2001 are due to larger production volumes). Similar "experience curves" (Johnson, 1984) are visible in the costs of other technologies that are crucial in the climate fight. For instance, the costs of electricity produced by the newest wind turbines have historically declined from 9 to 17 percent for every doubling of installed wind power capacity (EWEA, 2009, p. 59). While these "learning rates" are not a forecasting tool, they show how costs would develop if existing trends continue in the future, assuming no major technological breakthroughs or large fluctuations in prices of commodities such as steel.
</p>

<p>
Rapid decarbonization initiatives could well lead to radical decreases in the costs of low-carbon infrastructure. A rapid decarbonization program would necessarily increase demand for low-carbon technologies, such as renewable and nuclear power plants, energy storage, transmission, efficiency-increasing technologies, electric vehicles, and so forth. Increased demand would translate to larger production runs, which in turn would make the installation of ever more expensive production machinery profitable. Many crucial low-carbon technologies are still manufactured in small batches using labor-intensive methods, as demand cannot justify vast investments in true mass production. When such investments are made, major cost savings are still possible: even in solar PVs, a recent $ 1 bn investment in automated manufacturing cut costs by 30 percent compared to hitherto lowest-cost manufacturers (Chris Martin, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-24/first-solar-is-using-robots-to-better-tap-the-sun" title="“First Solar is using robots to better tap the sun,”" class="https">“First Solar is using robots to better tap the sun,”</a> Bloomberg Businessweek, January 24, 2018.). Similar or even larger cost reductions could well happen in other sectors: for instance, due to their size rotor blades for wind turbines are still to a large extent hand-made, even though the cost of blades represents over 20 percent of the total cost of a turbine (EWEA 2009). Automated manufacturing is being studied by several manufacturers, but investments necessary to automate the construction of blades 40 to 70 meters long are hard to justify with current demand. 
</p>

<p>
In other words, it's possible that rapid climate action would in fact drive down the cost of production enough to offset much, or even all, of the costs of expedited action - even before accounting for the costs of increased risk of catastrophic outcomes, which rapid decarbonization could help avoid. Without more detailed rapid decarbonization plans, this is difficult to assess: however, the possibility alone should warrant the development of such plans. Interestingly, this approach and the carbon price profile developed by Daniel et al. (2019) bears striking resemblance to the best historical example of how democracies confronted an existential threat, and defeated it with industrial mobilization: the Second World War.
</p>

<h2>Case study: U.S. industrial mobilization for the Second World War</h2>

<br>

<p>
Planning for rapid decarbonization to happen within a decade from the word "go" may seem hopelessly unrealistic. However, history shows that rapid turnarounds of a scale that is now required have happened repeatedly, once the stakes have been high enough. Perhaps the best example comes from the industrial mobilization of the United States to the Second World War. 
</p>

A determined effort to out-produce the Axis nations saw the United States devote up to 50 percent of its gross national product to war production. The results were, in a word, stupendous: United States manufactured about 40 percent of all armaments used in the war, while being able to invest in hugely expensive and technologically risky research and development projects such as the atomic bomb, the B-29 bomber, and miniature proximity fuses for artillery. What’s more, the industrial mobilization was achieved with surprisingly little disruption of the civilian economy: while some products were rationed and new durable consumer goods such as refrigerators and civilian cars were not manufactured, civilian spending actually increased during the war (Rockoff 1998, Wilson 2016, Lacey 2012, Klein 2012, Mason and Bossey 2020). The war mobilization also finally put an end to the Great Depression and paved way for the post-war American prosperity.

To be clear, we do not advocate declaring war to climate change. We are also aware that metaphors like “war” or “Manhattan project” may be dangerously misleading if applied to climate mitigation discussions. However, we believe that despite these very real issues, it is worthwhile to examine just how rapidly industrialized countries have managed to transform their infrastructure, if need be. Above all, the success of the U.S. war mobilization serves as an “existence proof” how a democratically governed free market economy can direct its resources towards defeating an existential risk to its way of life. There are also some intriguing similarities between the political difficulties faced by president Roosevelt and others who foresaw that the rise of totalitarian dictatorships posed an existential threat to democracies all over the world, and the political difficulties faced today by scientists, politicians and activists who try to convince the public that measures to neutralize the climate threat are essential if our way of life is to continue.

<p>
After all, ominous signs of a coming war were visible from the mid-1930s. After the Great Depression, totalitarian regimes were ascendant. Germany under Adolf Hitler openly rejected the military restrictions of the Versailles Treaty, started a rapid rearmament program and withdrew from the League of Nations in 1933. In 1935, Italy invaded Ethiopia with the aim of colonizing the country, and a year later, a Nationalist revolt - backed by fascist Italy and Germany - ignited the Spanish Civil War. In 1937, the Second Sino-Japanese War broke out, an event that some historians suggest was the true beginning of the Second World War. However, the mass slaughter of the First World War, and the politicians' promise that it would be "a war to end all wars", were still etched into public memory. Across Europe, governments failed to effectively recognize, cooperate, and respond to the potential danger of German rearmament. In the United States, which had never joined the League of Nations and whose public felt themselves detached from the European squabbles, rearmament was especially contentious topic. Only in 1938, after an European war scare caused by the German annexation of Austria and parts of Czechoslovakia, the U.S. Congress passed the Fleet Expansion Act that increased the size of the U.S. Navy by 20 percent. By that time, president Roosevelt had become convinced that another war was probable; however, his policies were steadfastly resisted by a large and influential isolationist movement.

<p>
During summer 1938, British and French governments began to order large quantities of arms and equipment, in particular aircraft, from U.S. manufacturers. These initial orders financed a major expansion of production capacity, including a tripling of aircraft industry workforce by 1940 (Wilson 2016:55-56).  
</p>

<br>
<br>
<br>

<p>
The effort, whose total cost rose to about four trillion current dollars, was paid for by a combination of newly issued government bonds (about 50 percent), increased taxation (24 percent) and money creation (26 percent), and evidence indicates that the United States could have easily financed the war even if it had continued to beyond 1946 (Lacey 2012).

<h2>Climate Emergency Planning: status in 2020</h2>

<br>

<p>
<i>Plans are worthless, but planning is everything. There is a very great distinction because when you are planning for an emergency you must start with this one thing: the very definition of "emergency" is that it is unexpected, therefore it is not going to happen the way you are planning.</i> (Dwight D. Eisenhower, 14 Nov 1957)
</p>

<p>
The details of plans that are designed in advance will be incorrect. However, the planning process demands the thorough exploration of options and contingencies. The knowledge and know-how gained during this probing is essential: without it, selecting appropriate actions as future events unfold will be difficult if not impossible. This old lesson was learned again during the COVID-19 crisis, when major decisions had to be taken in very limited time, with very limited capability to leisurely reflect upon the matter. Future crises will undoubtedly follow the same lesson plan.

<h2>Discussion and conclusions</h2>

<br>

<p>
To be clear, this paper does not argue that existing plans for orderly transformation should be abandoned, just that it would be prudent to complement them with a set of more ambitious emergency plans.
