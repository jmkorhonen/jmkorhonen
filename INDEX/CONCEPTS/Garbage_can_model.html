Garbage can model of organizational choice 
</p>

<br>
<br>

<p>
"The Garbage Can Modes of Decision Making (from Aberbach and Christensen 2014)<br>
The garbage can perspective, as used here, comes in two versions—one “pure” and one modified. In what might be called the “pure” or “classic” garbage can, goals are not precisely defined (they are discovered through action), technology is unclear (trial and error is the way actors proceed), and there is fluid participation in decision making (participants drift in and out). The final product is an unpredictable coupling of problems looking for solutions and solutions looking for prob- lems, problems and solutions that are added and removed from the agenda, and actors are described as “coming and going” to decision situations that also are fluid. All this yields deci- sions that are therefore difficult to understand and explain (Cohen et al., 1972). Some basic factors lead to such features. One is that actors, like political and administrative leaders, have capacity or attention problems, leading them to be part-time participants (March, 1994). Another factor is that decision situations may imply ambiguous stimuli, that is, it is not entirely clear what they are all about (March &amp; Olsen, 1976). Decision situations are also situa- tions where broader social roles are enacted, and therefore where the formal decisions to be made are only part of the picture. This means that garbage can processes are often characterized by the use of symbols to increase the legitimacy of leaders (March &amp; Olsen, 1989; Weick, 1995). John Kingdon’s (1984) excellent book Agendas, Alternatives, and Public Policies presents a<br>
modified version of the garbage can and applies it to agenda setting and decision making in a variety of areas. Kingdon retains the framework of problems looking for solutions and solutions looking for problems, but adds the role of policy entrepreneurs and windows of opportunity. This gives more structure and instrumentality to the conception of the process and increases one’s ability to predict outcomes (Aberbach &amp; Christensen, 2001). It is important to point out two aspects related to this perspective. First is its temporal or con- textual nature, that is, there are many preconditions or contexts that have to be combined in a dynamic way to open a “window of opportunity” and eventually to keep it open for some time. Second, Kingdon’s argument adds a more culturally inspired element where traditions and his- torical trajectories may be punctuated through critical junctures and shocks (Baumgartner &amp; Jones, 1993; Selznick, 1957), leading to a new path, something that, for example, was quite typi- cal of the reforms in New Zealand (Gregory, 2003). A more elaborate version of this, where rational and cultural thinking are combined, is found in the works of Kathleen Thelen. Streeck and Thelen (2005) make a distinction between the change process, which can be both incremental and abrupt, and the result of the change process, which can represent either continuity or discontinuity. This yields four possible combinations of process and result: “reproduction by adaptation,” which is a combination of incremental process and continuity in result; “breakdown and replacement,” which is a combination of abrupt change and discontinuity of result; “survival and return,” which combines abrupt change and continuity, that is, after a period of conflict and upheaval the system reverts to its roots; and finally, “gradual transformation,” which couples incremental change and discontinuity, meaning that major trans- formations may result from many small and seemingly insignificant changes, whether as the result of a cumulative process or of partly parallel processes."

Dumpster diving into idea reservoirs: how do organizations start to search for solutions?
</p>

<p>
- garbage can model of org behavior: orgs tend to use recent ideas (garbage can model), but what activates this search? When do they start to look for ideas?<br>
- satisfying has been suggested to end the search<br>
- how ideas get thrown to trash?<br>
- prior literature: problem or opportunity-based search<br>
- we believe the search is more or less constant???
</p>

<p>
The garbage can model of organizational choice (Cohen et al., 1972) disconnects problems, solutions and decision makers from each others. In the original conceptualization, four relatively independent event streams interact to produce specific decisions: there are problems requiring attention, solutions that are looking for a question, choice opportunities that give “organization man” opportunities for making decisions, and participants that come and go.
</p>

<br>

<p>
“From this point of view, an organization is a collection of choices looking for problems, issues and feelings looking for decision situations in which they might be aired, solutions looking for issues to which they might be the answer, and decision makers looking for work.”

<h2>Cohen et al.’s “organized anarchies”</h2>

<br>
<br>

<p>
<span class="zim-tag">@OrganizedAnarchy</span><br>
Cohen et al.’s “organized anarchies” are defined by three characteristics: problematic preferences, unclear technology, and fluid participation. 
</p>

<p>
- problematic preferences refers to amibuity regarding problems and goals<br>
- organizational actors may be uncertain as to both the nature of problems they face and what they hope to accomplish; they may, in fact, discover their preferences through acting, rather than acting to achieve their preferences - this inverts rationalist models of decision-making<br>
- unclear technology means that organizational members are uncertain of the rules, structures and processes by which decisions are made - technology refers not to technological artifacts but rather to organizational processes and methods, i.e. in organized anarchies, organizational members do not fully understand the workings of their organization<br>
- NOTE: collective inventions are very much organized anarchies<br>
- “Technium” is an organized anarchy
</p>

<p>
- fluid participation means that different actors are involved in different decisions, or in the same decision at different times; the boundaries are variable
</p>

<p>
The GCM conceives of decision-making in organized anarchies in terms of independent streams of problems, solutions, participants, and choice opportunities (although whether these are truly independent or interdependent is controversial). “Solutions,” or inherently preferred policies, may exist prior to any problem, and advocates of particular solutions will seek to attach them to any problem and choice opportunity that promises to serve as a vehicle for the policy’s adoption. 
</p>

<p>
Has been subsequently applied to public schools (Sproull et al. 1978), military operations (March and Olsen 1979), and government agencies (Weissinger-Baylon 1986). The widest attention, however, may be Kingdon’s adaptation of “Policy Streams” model (Kingdon, 1984, 1995).
</p>

<p>
Kingdon reduced the four streams to three: problems, policies, and politics. Politics stream incorporates the participants and choice opportunities streams of the original. Kingdon also added the concepts of policy windows and policy entrepreneurs.
