MOVES IN RESEARCH PAPER INTRODUCTIONS<br>
CARS: Creating A Research Space (Swales and Feak 1994)
</p>

<p>
Move 1: Establish a research territory<br>
- show that the general research area is important, central interesting, problematic, or relevant in some way; and/or<br>
- introduce and review items of previous research in the area
</p>

<p>
Move 2: Establish a niche<br>
- indicate a gap in the previous research, raise a question about it, or extend previous knowledge in some way
</p>

<p>
Move 3: Occupy the niche<br>
- outline purposes and aims, or state the nature of the present research; and/or<br>
- announce principal findings; and/or<br>
- indicate the structure of the paper
</p>

<p>
STRATEGIES FOR WRITING COHERENT PARAGRAPHS
</p>

<p>
<ol type="A" start="1">
<li>Organize your information according to one of the following structures:</li>
<li>Top-down (main point/argument first, then support)</li>
<li>General to specific</li>
<li>Problem-solution</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
<ol type="A" start="2">
<li>Use topic sentences in paragraphs to</li>
</ol>
- organize information<br>
- link up text with headings<br>
- express the function of the paragraph
</p>

<p>
<ol type="A" start="3">
<li>Link your sentences explicitly</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
WRITING INTRODUCTION USING CARS MODEL
</p>

<p>
Structure Intro into 4 paragraphs:<br>
<ol type="1" start="1">
<li>Why your article is topical, interesting and worth reading</li>
<li>What has been and has not been done before in this area</li>
<li>What the contribution of this article is</li>
<li>Outline of the story of how you achieved your contribution</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
Para 2 answers the following Q's:<br>
- how has previous work approached/not approached this topic<br>
- how has the writer characterized/categorized previous research in this field?<br>
- what is the research gap?<br>
and/or<br>
- what is problematic about the issue under study?<br>
DO NOT GO INTO DETAIL
</p>

<p>
Para 3:<br>
- What is the contribution of my study to research on the topic/in the field<br>
- how does my study fill the gap or remedy some of the limitations in previous research
</p>

<p>
Para 4:<br>
- how has the study been conducted?<br>
- how have the writers come up with their findings?
</p>

<br>

<p>
Communication strategy
</p>

<p>
The key consideration in my presentation was the fact that few if any in the audience were experts in the history of technology, or with the constraints-innovation literature. This meant that I had to establish the importance of my research (as Create A Research Space or CARS model suggested) and get the audience somehow "hooked" into the presentation. I deliberately chose to go a bit overboard with grandiose (and hopefully humorous) claim "how to invent just about anything and become insanely rich." This was a cheap trick in a sense, but such cheap tricks seem to work quite well, in my experience, as long as they are not overdone and are used judiciously.
</p>

<p>
I approached the presentation as a chance to practice presenting my research to a generalist audience. To that end, quite a lot of the finer nuances of my research were necessarily glossed over, and possibly some claims were stronger (or at least less reserved) than they would be had I presented to a specialist audience. My experience from lecturing and pitching design projects has made me a firm believer in the very limited capability of audience to absorb new information; a 10-minute presentation can at best hammer home one or maybe two "takeaways." The takeaway or sound bite I tried to get stick was that 
</p>

<p>
1) constraints won't do much to accelerate the development of technologies, but they may accelerate the _adoption_ of previously developed ones, and <br>
2) necessity is the mother of inventors, not inventions; and a short reasoning why it is so. 
</p>

<p>
Some years ago, I was greatly influenced by a short book "Made to Stick: Why Some Ideas Survive and Others Die." The model used in the book, SUCCES, tells that successful ideas have to be
</p>

<p>
Simple<br>
Unexpected<br>
Concrete<br>
Credible<br>
Emotional<br>
Stories. 
</p>

<p>
The structure of my presentations often attempts to follow this format: start by simple and concrete (i.e. Facebook), show something unexpected (that it doesn't take a genius to invent something; a few funny pictures), present credible information to back up the claim, mix in something that stirs emotions (Finnish history works pretty nicely in Finland; in my lectures, I often use nuclear power), and try to work out the story. This presentation was not the perfect example of this approach, and it could be improved (and will be). In particular, the smooth story arc needs work, and I may need a bit bigger stunner to grasp the attention of the audience.
</p>

<p>
Presentation delivery
</p>

<p>
I believe my presentation delivery was relatively good. For some audiences, I could have used a little less handwaving, and I'd like to be able to move more freely around the "stage." However, technical considerations largley prevented me from doing so this time, as I was bound to the laptop to change the slides. There was some fidgeting at the beginning, due to nervousness; this could be combated by rehearsing the presentation more. In general, I believe my nonverbal communication was adequate although not stellar (could have been more relaxed at many points), language seemed to be clear enough (again, there's room for improvement), and slides were okay - not great. (Sorry, I could do much better.)
</p>

<p>
The key problem with presentation delivery - as noted by some reviewers - was that I ran out of time to present everything I had wanted. Two more minutes would have been enough. Timing issue needs to be worked on, again with rehearsals. However, in my opinion I got through the key message I wanted to deliver - that constraints don't do much to accelerate the development of technologies. The other points, in particular the distinction between development and adoption, was unfortunately cut out.
