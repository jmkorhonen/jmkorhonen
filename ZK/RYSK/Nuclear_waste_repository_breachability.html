<p>
- discovery phase: discovery through fragments of ores, examining the faces of different gullies and ravines, and erosion patterns<br>
- shoading or costeaning (as known by Cornish miners): when the general direction of the lodes has been ascertained from facts elicited during the working of other mines in the district, a series of pits is sunk, as nearly at right angles as possible to the assumed run of the mineral veins. These shode pits are about three feet in width, six in length, and extend in depth <br>
104<br>
through the alluvial deposits, a few feet into subjacent rock. In order to avoid the chance of missing any lode which may occur in the superficies to be examined, the pits are sunk at regular distances, and afterwards united by galleries, which would necessarily travrse any vein which might escape detection by the shode pits themselves.
</p>

<p>
- adits: galleries cut a little above the surface of the nearest valley, in such a way as to intersect the lode at a certain distance from the surface; REQUIRES VALLEY AT OR BELOW ORE LEVEL
</p>

<p>
Should the lode, after proper examination, be found to be productive of ore, other shafts are sunk, and a regular series of levels driven. In the first place, galleries will be excavated in the substances of the vein for the purpose of extracting its contents: these are, in the Cornish mines, placed at distances of ten fathoms from each other, and are all connected with a shaft through which<br>
105<br>
the excavated rock and metallic ores are transported to the surface. <br>
...<br>
The water which percolates int the mine below the point at which the adit level meets the shaft, is drawn out by a series of pumps worked either by water power or a steam-engine. For a short time after a shaft has been commenced, and before it has attained any considerable depth, the rubbish removed is conveyed to the surface by a simple windlass moved by manual labour. When the pit has reached a more considerable depth, a contrivance, called a whim or a gin, moved by horses, is commonly employed, although steam power is daily becoming of more frequent application. 
</p>

<p>
...
</p>

<p>
Methods of attacking the Rock. ... If the ground be moderately soft, nothing but an ordinary pick and shovel is used; but if it be hard, and is either stratified, or contains numerous fissures, he has recourse to steel wedges or points, called gads, by driving which into the crevices of the rock, he is enabled to split off larger portions than he could detach by the use of the pick alone. When the ground to be cut through does not admit of being thus broken, the working is effected by the assistance of gunpowder. 
</p>

<p>
Before this agent can be employed it is necessary to bore a hole in the rock for its reception. This is done by a bar of iron furnished at one of its extremities with a steel point armed with cutting edges. To use this instrument, one of the miners holds the sharpened end of the borer to the rock, whilst another hits the other extremity a heavy blow with a large hammer or mallet. As the hole deepens, the person who holds the tool turns it<br>
106<br>
between each blow about one-fourth of a revolution, and by this means a deep hole is ultimately obtained. The borer is, during the operation, from time to time removed from the hole in order to take away the broken rock, and a little water is added for the double purpose of cooling the borer and facilitating its action.

<p>
- Fig. 73 has a plan of Huel Crofty Copper Mine in Cornwall; "in this mine, as in the generality of those worked in Cornwall, the levels are excavated at distances of ten fathoms from each other, since by this arrangement the ventilation of the workins is not only well maintained... <br>
- suggests ten fathoms (16-18.29 m) common practice

- open mines not economical before heavy machinery was developed:
</p>

<p>
Open workings are, generally speaking, expensive, because they require a great body of foreign matter to be moved by physical labor, the application of machinery being inexpedient. If, by any possible means, such open work can be avoided, it will be found advantageous. It is cheaper to extract the same mineral by an underground mine than by open diggings. The latter are, besides the disadvantages mentioned above, exposed to all the changes of weather, the heat of the sun, frost and rain; and as the amount of work done constitutes the price of labor, the operatives in a mine cannot suffer by these changes; all the disadvantages add to the cost of the mineral, and cause its price to be higher than it probably would be if extracted by means of underground rock. In many instances such work cannot be avoided. Where the ore is covered by loose ground, it would be unsafe to form a roof of it; at least, it would cost much labor and timber to prepare a roof. 
</p>

<p>
54
</p>

<p>
- if large amounts of water are present in the mine, a drift needs to be excavated for drainage. This needs pumps.
</p>

<p>
- mines need two shafts to ensure supply of fresh air
</p>

<p>
58
</p>

<p>
- limestone rock never forms a safe roof, and therefore requires much timber to secure excavations in such materials.
</p>

<p>
62
</p>

<p>
- illustrations of shaft framing
</p>

<p>
63
</p>

<p>
- timbering wood: <br>
The size of the wood is not often more than 8 inches for the heaviest kind of timbering; in most instances it is 6 inches, and very seldom but 5 inches. 
</p>

<p>
64
</p>

<p>
In most cases, it may be found equally as profitable to place the timbers close together as to set them at intervals, and protect the spaces between them by planks or other material. In the latter case, the frames are never set farther than 3 feet apart, and if the facing boards are not very strong, say 2 or 3 inch planks, the distance is 2 feet and less. 
</p>

<p>
81
</p>

<p>
- costs of working (USA), per cubic yard: <br>
- limestone 30 cents, if no stripping is done<br>
- removal of earth or rubbish may bring the cost to 75 ¢<br>
- sandstones 20-30 cents<br>
- shale, or slate, 10 cents<br>
- granite, trap, gneiss and porphury may cost $3 per cu.yard if it is to be broken<br>
- stratified hard rock $1-2. <br>
- in digging a shaft of small dimensions in hard rock the expenses per yard are considerably higher than in a wide shaft, and far higher than in the open quarry<br>
A cubic yard of granite or trap cannot be taken out of a four feet shaft for less than $12; from a larger shaft at from $6 to $10, and from a vein with good undermining it may be removed for $1. These prices are chiefly regulated by the amount of work caused to the miner in separating the stones from the mass of the rock.<br>
- sinking a shaft in sandstone, $3-6 per cubic yard<br>
- in slate, shale or gravel, $1-2<br>
- all prices exclusive of timber or walling<br>
- a drift in granite or unstratified rock is quite as expensive as a shaft in that kind of rock, but in stratified rock it may be done cheaper<br>
- a cubic yard of the rocks of the coal strata may be removed at $1.50, or $1.<br>
- in these prices are included the sharpening of tools, and the removal of the fragments to the mouth of the pit
</p>

<p>
82
</p>

<p>
- a cubic yard of brittle matter, if veinstone or ore, may be cut loose by the miner at the price of 50 cents and less, slaty rock at the same price, and from that to $1. Roch which must be blasted and broken, will cause an expense of $1 to $2 per yard. 
</p>

<p>
86
</p>

<p>
- NOTE! transporting of material requires DESCENDING adits!! Typical descent is 2 feet in a 100 feet of length. 
</p>

<p>
87
</p>

<p>
There are various other means of transporting mineral in the interior of mines, such as hand-sleighs, baskets with slips, or baskets carried on the backs of men or females. These means are not employed in our mines, and we should be sadly <br>
88<br>
disappointed in the character of our citizens if they ever resorted to this mode of transportation which degrades human intellect and human power. It is preferable to let all the minerals remain where they are than to require men to debase themselves for their extraction. If mines do not pay enough to afford manly employment to miners, that is, to require of them only such labor as cannot be performed either by machines or by animals - labor in which human intellect is exercised - it is better to abstain from mining. There are machines, sleighs, or cars, in use in the European mines, to which a man, boy, or girl, is hitched by means of a strap; they work in low galleries or drifts on their hands and feet like quadrupeds, and for no other reason than that it would cause a little more expense in excavating a spacious drift, when animals or machinery might be used for the same purpose. The forms of barrows, cars, and wagons are various, to suit the special purposes, or meet the fancies of the superintendent of a mine. It would lead us too far to notice these varieties.

<p>
- water lifting from a mine shaft with horses: <br>
Water is lifted in a large barrel, as shown in the drawing; this is a strong oak vessel well provided with iron hoops, and has a capacity of from 80 to 100 gallons; two horses generally are required to hoist it when filled with water. 
</p>

<p>
92<br>
- engine power:<br>
One-horse power of the engine may lifth 12,000 pounds one foot in one minute, after subtracting the friction in machinery, and in ropes or chains. ... One square foot of boiler surface exposed to the influence of the fire (whereby flues are calculated only half their surface), will produce sufficient steam for raising 1,000 pounds one foot high in one minute. In a vertical shaft, or in an inclined shaft, the platforms may move with a velocity of 10 or 12 feet per second. 
</p>

<p>
97
</p>

<p>
- working hours in a mine, particularly ill-ventilated, need to be limited to about 8
</p>

<p>
114
</p>

<p>
- "rebound effect" of safety equipment:<br>
Wise and good men, observing the destruction of human life in such cases [methane explosions], have taxed their minds for the invention of preventives, but these benevolent exertions merely increased the avarice of men - ventilation is now more neglected than before the invention of Davy's safety-lamp, and explosions are more frequent than ever.
</p>

<p>
We should not allude to the safety-lamp of Sir Humphrey <br>
115<br>
Davy if it was not wanted for the examination of a mine. The workman should never use it; there should be always sufficient fresh air in the workroomss and galleries of the mine to render open lamps or candles perfectly safe. 
</p>

<p>
118
</p>

<p>
- canvas tubes 12 inch diameter (from a yard wide canvas) and supported by metal hoops placed yard apart can be suspended overhead and force air 200 or 300 yards to provide a set of workmen with air. For one-man use, 3 inch wide tubes can be employed.
</p>

<p>
122
</p>

<p>
-pumping of water:<br>
-maximum rise of a suction pump: 33 or 34 feet; in practice this height can never be reached
</p>

<p>
130-131<br>
- formulae for calculating velocity of water in lead, cast-iron, and wooden pipes.
</p>

<p>
132
</p>

<p>
By actual experiment, it has been found that a man may lift 80 gallons of water in one minute 10 feet high, by a good pump. He will, therefore, lift 160 gallons 5 feet high, and 40 gallons 20 feet high in the same time. <br>
- this is mentioned as a high result for human labor<br>
133<br>
- result, 6400 foot-pounds, is mentioned to be one half too high<br>
- for ox, 15000 foot-pounds can be produced<br>
- for mule, 20,000<br>
- for horse, 30,000<br>
- for steam engine or water wheel, 40,000 may be assumed
</p>

<p>
138
</p>

<p>
- pump-rod pumps:<br>
- one set of pumps is not often made higher than 150 feet, and from that to 100 feet. Each set throws its water to a cistern, from which the next pump sucks it.<br>
139<br>
- the lowest set of pump seldom exceeds 40-50 feet, because it must throw out air that usually comes with water in a mine
</p>

<p>
141
</p>

<p>
- a proposal for a mine on inclined shaft, fig. 76
</p>

<p>
142
</p>

<p>
- cost of inclined shaft:<br>
A cubic yard of a vertical pit will cost at least twice the price of a cubic yard in the horizontal drift; and if the work in the slope cannot be done quite as cheap as in the drift, it will cost but little more.
</p>

<p>
144
</p>

<p>
- one horsepower defined as 33000 foot-pounds per minute<br>
- in a Cornish steam engine, 3.5 pounds of coal are required for 1 hp, and the wages of engineer and fireman, and the cost of repairs; for large engines, theres increase the expense by about 1 % per hour, and for small engines, 2 %. <br>
- a common engine of at least 100 hp will consume 5 pounds of coal for the same power<br>
- smaller, lower-pressure engine 10 lb<br>
- small engine 15-20 lb<br>
- cost per hp little over 1 cent in the best engines, and about 10 cents in small engines with high-priced fuel<br>
- unit of power will cost in a horse from 20 to 50 cents, and with ox and mule about the same<br>
- human labor about $1
