<p>
There is no single accepted answer among academic historians or even among leftists. As one might expect, for such a politically charged and relevant question it becomes really difficult to separate history proper from politics.
</p>

<p>
One reasonable way to approach the question is to look at what the leaders of the revolution thought and how they preceived or justified authoritarianism. It's also important to understand their political experience and context.
</p>

<p>
A good starting point I think is the Second International, an association of primarily Marxist parties across Europe founded in the late 19th century. <b>At that point, the revolutionary character of Marxism was not yet agreed upon among its followers, and among the parties reformist Marxists tended to hold sway.</b> Unlike modern social democrats, these reformists still (if only nominally) held the ultimate goal of one day fully overcoming capitalism-- <b>the major disagreement within the parties, then, was the question of reform or revolution,</b> as discussed in Rosa Luxemburg's eponymous pamphlet.
</p>

<p>
As Europe approached the First World War, <b>the reformist tendency within socialist parties would deepen and take on a nationalistic character.</b> By then, the German Social Democratic Party (SPD) had become the dominant socialist party within Europe, and it had achieved significant labor reforms at home. <b>This, combined with the threat of invasion from a deeply reactionary Russian Empire compelled German reformists to associate socialism with German patriotism</b> (ironically, a similar trend would occur in France against Germany, which many Frenchmen perceived as a reactionary threat).
</p>

<p>
When WW1 broke out at last, the SPD (and most other European parties) voted in favor of war credits, beginning a period of Burgfriedenspolitik wherein the SPD abstained from strikes and other subversive activities against the war effort. Those notable few who disagreed with this policy splintered away from the SPD into the USPD, the Spartacist League, and eventually the German Communist Party. The Russian Social Democratic Labor Party, later to be led by Lenin, also notably opposed war by majority.
</p>

<p>
This is all to say that the events leading up to WW1 and the Russian revolution precipitated huge, seemingly irreconciliable divisions between the reformist and revolutionary factions of European parties. Subsequently, when in 1918-19 German revolutionaries attempted to create their own communist state, they were crushed (or, in their own words, betrayed) by their former comrades in the now wholly reformist SPD.
</p>

<p>
So what does this have to do with authoritarianism in Russia? Before the failure of the German revolution, the leaders of the Russian revolution had counted on its victory, and the subsequent victory of a sweeping international revolution. <b>The hope was that, since Germany was among the foremost industrial powers of the world, it could provide material necessities and alleviate the stresses of war, in turn allowing for demilitarization and democratization across both Germany and Russia. Since this didn't happen, the ascendant Bolsheviks were left in a very, very difficult situation.</b> They were in charge of a war-weary nation with hostile states on all sides and powerful counterrevolutionaries within. Realistically there was only one thing they could do besides capitulate-- dig in, and use the full power of the state to survive for as long as possible.
</p>

<p>
Rosa Luxemburg summarizes this impasse pretty well in The Russian Tragedy:
</p>

<p>
<div style='padding-left: 30pt'>
The awkward position that the Bolsheviks are in today, however, is, together with most of their mistakes, <b>a consequence of basic insolubility of the problem posed to them by the international, above all the German, proletariat. To carry out the dictatorship of the proletariat and a socialist revolution in a single country surrounded by reactionary imperialist rule and in the fury of the bloodiest world war in human history – that is squaring the circle.</b> Any socialist party would have to fail in this task and perish – whether or not it made self-renunciation the guiding star of its policies. ... Such is the false logic of the objective situation: any socialist party that came to power in Russia today must pursue the wrong tactics so long as it, as part of the international proletarian army, is left in the lurch by the main body of this army.
</div>
</p>

<p>
For example, as Trotsky discusses in his Report on the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Red Army, <b>their initial worker's militia could not confront the vastly better-equipped and better-trained German army, nor even the relatively more experienced armies under White control. As a result, Trotsky was compelled to professionalize the army, institute harsh drafts, and even incorporate captured White officers at gunpoint just to win the civil war.</b> Both he and Lenin recognized that these measures were counter to the principles of the revolution but were nonetheless necessary if the revolution were to succeed at all.
</p>

<p>
As we now know, neither Germany nor any comparably industrialized country underwent a successful communist revolution. The Soviets would remain isolated long after Lenin's death and Stalin's further entrenchment of authoritarianism-- <b>what started as emergency measures became standard procedure when the emergency never went away.</b>
</p>

<p>
<b>For subsequent revolutions, the "fruit from a poisoned tree" situation you described is sort of right</b>-- these revolutions drew explicitly from Lenin's revolutionary measures and, sometimes less explicitly, from Stalin's entrenchment. <b>One might even say that they were all part of a single, broader revolution, and can't be treated as isolated cases; this is contentious, however.</b> Of course, later on certain countries like Cambodia and North Korea would spin off on their own and abandon communism even in name, but since they faced the same problems of political isolation, they had at least an excuse to remain authoritarian.
</p>

<p>
In summary:
</p>

<p>
<div style='padding-left: 30pt'>
Pre-WW1 politics caused a deep rift between reformist and revolutionary factions in European socialism
</div>
</p>

<p>
<div style='padding-left: 30pt'>
This led to the (short-term) success of the Russian revolution and the failure of the German revolution, as reformists were much more powerful in the latter country
</div>
</p>

<p>
<div style='padding-left: 30pt'>
Without German support, the Russian Bolsheviks had to enact emergency authoritarian measures to remain afloat
</div>
</p>

<p>
<div style='padding-left: 30pt'>
Later, the static international situation allowed Stalin to entrench authoritarianism
</div>
</p>

<p>
<div style='padding-left: 30pt'>
Future revolutions would emulate the Bolsheviks and in turn face the same problems of political isolation
</div>
</p>

<p>
Note again that this is just a single perspective, taking into account mostly primary sources from the leaders of the Russian and German revolutions. Stalin's role adds another wrinkle, as there are leftist historians far more sympathetic towards him than I. Still, this is an important point of view I think, and the one I'm most familiar with.

<i>Are there any works that have investigated the thesis that the authoritarianism simply was a continuity from the situation before the communist revolution in the country where it happened? As in, the question is wrong: why were we expecting an essentially economic revolution to also democratize the political leadership?</i>
</p>

<p>
It's reasonable to expect a communist revolution to be democratizing because the communists of 1917 were explicitly democratic. The Bolshevik party itself began as the Russian Social Democratic Labor Party, only later changing to the Communist Party when reformists and revolutionaries officially split following WW1. Nor was the party only democratic in name: in principle, the Social Democrats explicitly opposed Tsarist autocracy and advocated for workers' control at all levels of society. Up until the Russian Civil War, in fact, the Bolsheviks further advocated for the dissolution of army in favor of a democratized people's militia.
</p>

<p>
It's important to remember that communism (or social democracy was it was then known) is not purely an economic doctrine. Lenin in particular accused other members of his party of economism, that is (what he perceived) a vulgar reduction of Marxism to economic terms. For Lenin, Marxism was the whole package-- political, economic, cultural revolution, necessarily tied together.
</p>

<p>
Art in the Soviet Union, for instance, did see huge leaps in democratization and experimentation throughout the 1920s, in direct conjunction with the political party as a means of bringing the disparate masses of Russia into social participation. This trend, along with any political liberalization, would be reversed under Stalin, first as political exegency, and later as principle.<br>
