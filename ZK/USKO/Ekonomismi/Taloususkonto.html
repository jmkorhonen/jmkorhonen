<p>
Catholic priests once preached to the people in Latin to ensure that their audience had no idea what was being said. The purpose of the sermon was not to explain or persuade. The purpose was to silence. How can you criticise something you don’t understand?
</p>

<p>
Economists often speak in Latin, and in Greek. We love to wear folk down with a few deltas and gammas before finishing them off with a bit of ceteris paribus. But one of our best tricks is to use words that sound like English but to which we attach our own very specific meaning. We use simple-sounding words like “efficiency” and “unemployment” to draw the unsuspecting into our conversation. Then we slam the door on their fingers when they admit to thinking that unemployment is measured by the number of people on the dole (it’s not) or that efficiency means reducing waste (not to economists it doesn’t).
</p>

<p>
While economics provides a bunch of simple tools to help break down complicated problems, the language of economics is more frequently used to confound and confuse. Especially when it’s politicians talking about economics.
</p>

<p>
The primary purpose of the econospeak that fills our airwaves, most of which is complete nonsense, is to keep ordinary Australians out of the big debates about tax, fairness, climate change and the provision of essential services.
</p>

<p>
Econospeak is a great way to limit the options on our democratic menu. Would you like a small tax cut and a small cut in services or a big tax cut and a big cut in services? What? You want to spend more money in health and education? You must be mad. Just imagine how “the markets” would react to such a suggestion.
</p>

<p>
The whole strategy has worked a treat for the past few decades. But even the most impenetrable language can’t keep people believing that preventing climate change or letting sick people see a doctor is unaffordable, or that the best way to help the poor is to cut taxes for the rich.
</p>

<p>
But just as you don’t need a black belt in karate to call out bullying when you see it, you don’t need to be an economist to call out nonsense when you hear it. I’ll let you in on a little secret: most people talking about the economy have got no idea what they are talking about. They aren’t economists. Most of what they say has no basis in economic theory or evidence. And the vast majority of actual economists can’t believe anyone takes what politicians have to say about the economy seriously.
</p>

<p>
Last month, the government’s senior economic adviser and treasury secretary, John Fraser, sounded the alarm when he said that Sydney and parts of Melbourne were in a housing bubble. Prime Minister Tony Abbott, who dabbled in journalism and the priesthood before settling on politics, indicated that not only was he unconcerned about any possible bubble but that the rising house prices were good.
</p>

<p>
One of them is wrong.
</p>

<p>
When the prime minister contradicted his most senior economic adviser, the media barely commented. They know the prime minister is just saying the words he needed to say that day. That’s not economics; it’s politics in disguise.
</p>

<p>
Like the literary classics, economic reports are more widely discussed than they are read.
</p>

<p>
The overwhelming majority of Australians think that we should spend more money on health, education and public transport. The vast majority also believe that Apple, Google and Gina Rinehart should pay more tax. Nearly everyone agrees that big corporations should be banned from donating money to political parties. But even though we live in a democracy, the vast majority’s desire for change is not sufficient to achieve it. “Business leaders” tell us that we can only make such changes after we “consult the markets”.
</p>

<p>
<b>Like the gods of cultures past, “the markets” can be angry. They can be vengeful. And they can punish non-believers. We must consult them cautiously. To simply inquire into the fall in the iron ore price, for instance, might spook them.</b>
</p>

<p>
While markets are real, it is absurd to suggest that they have feelings, needs or demands. A market is a place where buyers and sellers of a product come together. It might be a physical place, like the fish markets, or a virtual place, like eBay or the stock market. But markets never have feelings.
</p>

<p>
Rich people have feelings. Rich people who own billions of dollars’ worth of shares in a company often have very strong feelings, especially when it comes to government policy and tax rates. But the feelings of rich people are quite different to the feelings of “the market”. Consider the following example of how effectively economic language can conceal what’s going on. <b>Both of the following statements are describing the same proposal:</b>
</p>

<p>
<b>    1. Markets reacted angrily today to news that the government is considering tightening thin capitalisation provisions that have provided foreign investors with strong incentives to expand their Australian operations.</b>
</p>

<p>
<b>    2. Rich people overseas reacted angrily today to news that they might have to pay tax on the profits they earnt in Australia. After the government announced that it was considering clamping down on some of the most lucrative forms of multinational profit-shifting, some very wealthy Americans threatened to take their bat and ball and go home if they were forced to pay tax.</b>
</p>

<p>
The <b>trick only works when, like a monster in a horror movie, “the markets” seem close enough to feel threatening but not so close that we can see they are made of papier-mâché.</b>
</p>

<p>
The ASX, the Hang Seng, the Nikkei and the <b>Dow are on the nightly news to remind us that “the markets” are watching and judging us, and there is much that we don’t know and don’t understand.</b> Greater minds than ours have puzzled over these things.
</p>

<p>
Of course, <b>in reality the market doesn’t want anything. It is a metaphor, and it can no more judge our actions than Zeus or Apollo. The real question is whether or not the people droning on about market sentiment all the time know that. As the saying goes: the best patsy doesn’t know they are a patsy.</b>
