</p>

<p>
Things only seem reckless if you don't trace out the entire line of thought. Our own cosmologies ("space-time continuum", "quantum field theory") don't sound any more plausible on the face of them, either, if you skip all of the work that went into them. Why does "the electron has a dual wave-particle nature" sound more plausible on the face of it than "the Moon rotates around the Earth bound to a subtle crystalline sphere"? It doesn't.
</p>

<p>
The crystalline sphere idea is basically just a way to say, "something holds things in the sky, moves them around on super regular mostly spherical orbits, but it doesn't refract or reflect light." There are several possible answers to that quandary — today we accept that space is a vacuum and that the appearance of things being "held" is a consequence of gravitation. Space as a vacuum is a pretty weird idea (why aren't we sucked out into it? how can space be a vacuum when nature seems to try its damnest to avoid vacuums?), gravitational "action at  distance" was considered philosophically troubling even in Newton's time (how is that indistinguishable from magic, that one object can seemingly act on another without touching it?), and the presence of "why doesn't the moon just fly off into space and/or crash into the Earth?" questions in Reddit's r/askscience and r/explainlikeimfive subs makes it clear that even the modern mind has some real difficulties in understanding how orbital motion works without quite a bit of education. Crystalline spheres make sense if you don't really believe in "forces" (e.g. you require, as even Descartes did, some kind of mechanical "touching" to take place between all matter), you don't believe in a vacuum (or at least a permanent, sustained vacuum; plenism, the belief that vacuums are impossible, was not an unpopular theory into the 17th century, and is as much a theory of matter as anything else), and you understand the orbital motion is essentially spherical in nature (though even in the Ancient period, it was recognized that it was more complex than just that — e.g. Plato posed understanding retrograde motion of Mars as a problem to be solved).
</p>

<p>
If you want to understand pre-modern science, or any non-currently-accepted science, you have to dig into the world it came from, its context. You have to treat the past not as a bunch of "wrong" things but as something that very smart people could have believed. You also have to have a little humility regarding your own ability to believe in strange things. Why should illness be caused by invisible tiny monsters, and not travel through vapors in the air? Why should atoms exist as opposed to matter being infinitely divisible? Why should what we perceive as heat be a form of motion (what?) and not a substance? These things feel more or less acceptable to us if they've been deemed true since we were infants, but the "wrong" ideas here are not "wrong" because they are inherently absurd, and the "right" ideas are not "right" because they are inherently obvious.
</p>

<p>
The historian/philosopher of science Thomas Kuhn prided himself as giving a template for how this kind of work could be done, this reconstruction of past thinking. As I like to put it, the goal of a good historian of science is the explicate the weird (making apparently strange beliefs make sense) and to complicate the normal (showing how apparently obvious beliefs to us today are actually quite strange). It is about getting inside of the head of people who disagree with you on some fundamental facts about the world — not a bad skill in general these days. Kuhn's Copernican Revolution is not his most famous book but it is in some ways a very nice example of this: he puts as much effort in to helping the reader understand pre-Copernican arguments as the Copernican ones, and never relies on the idea that, say, Copernican was smarter or just "more right" than anyone who came before him.
</p>

<p>
Now, for some of these beliefs, it is hard to reconstruct the full circumstances. For the Greeks we sometimes only have isolated fragments of texts, or brief references in the writings of later scholars, all lacking a context of life or intellectual coherence. We don't always know where a belief came from or who it was in conversation with. To grab any idea out of isolation is to render it strange — if it is a "right" idea we tend to think it is genius, coming fully-formed out of nothing (e.g. special relativity), if it is a "wrong" idea we tend to call it silly (e.g. the luminiferous aether). Neither are very good approaches to understanding the quality of ideas and where they come from; both are better understood as things that come out of contexts, and the job of the historian is, in part, to reconstruct those contexts. (Consider, from an artifact perspective, how boggling the Antikythera mechanism is — if we knew more about the context of its creation, it would not seem so "miraculous" and "out of place" at all, by definition.)
