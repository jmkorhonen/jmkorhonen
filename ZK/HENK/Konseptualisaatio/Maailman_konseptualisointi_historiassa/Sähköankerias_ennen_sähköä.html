</p>

<p>
A repost of my previous answer that's the one in the FAQ linked by someone else:
</p>

<p>
I'm going to assume that by 'prior to the discovery and understanding of static electricity' you essentially are asking about the pre-'Scientific Revolution' time period - e.g., before William Gilbert's 1600 book De Magnete was using the word 'electricus' to refer to electrical phenomena, before Benjamin Franklin flying his kite and all that (after all, there's a sense in which electricity was first discovered by the first person to get a static electricity shock), and certainly before electric lights or Tesla cars.
</p>

<p>
It’s worth remembering that, <b>in antiquity and the middle ages, the workings of the natural world were fundamentally mysterious</b>. At a fundamental level, we modern types - living in a world with computers and search engines and university science faculties - generally assume that the natural world is orderly, based on natural laws. <b>Because of this, the world is, for us, in principle usually going to be solvable.</b> Things we don't understand are probably understandable through further research or experimentation (or perhaps have already been solved by people much smarter than us). Ancient and medieval people simply didn't have this mindset. As a result, their explanations of the natural world were - understandably - magical (see this previous comment of mine for more background on the mysterious, magical world of the ancients). <b>After all, if you think that the world at a metaphysical level is fundamentally unknowable, the presence of spirits and souls in objects doesn’t seem entirely silly.</b> Even Aristotle, that most practical-minded and scientific of Ancient Greek philosophers, thought that inanimate substances contain meaning/purpose (telos), and talked about souls, in ways that seem odd to people who grew up in a world that assumes the universe is fundamentally physical.
</p>

<p>
Writers in antiquity and the middle ages often thought in terms of sympathies and antipathies; particular objects would have natural attractions and repulsions from others. So, for example, it was believed that rubbing garlic on a magnet would stop it from working, while rubbing lambs’ blood would make it work again. These beliefs about magnets were eventually shown to be incorrect, but even Scientific Revolution figures like Descartes believed some of them. In general, medieval writers weren’t particularly inclined to argue with ancient authors except where religious doctrine intervened, so it took until after Columbus had ’discovered’ America for these ideas about garlic and lambs blood affecting magnets to eventually stop being considered common knowledge. All of which is to say that ancient people thought very differently to us; they were not basically modern people who just hadn't figured out electricity yet.
</p>

<p>
With that in mind, let's look at what some ancient writers said about electricity. The first figure to discuss static shocks is usually considered to be Thales of Miletus, though we only know that he discussed static shocks because his writing has not survived. Our main source on Thales discussing electrical phenomena is a biography by Diogenes Laertius, written close to a millennium later. According to Laertius, Thales was "the first, some say, to discuss physical problems. Aristotle and Hippias affirm that, arguing from the magnet and from amber, he attributed a soul or life even to inanimate objects."
</p>

<p>
The wording here perhaps suggests that amber's electric effect after being rubbed (e.g., your hair might be pulled towards it) was well-known to the Greeks before Thales; certainly there's plenty of amber jewelry in the archaeological record. Laertius seems to me to be implying that Thales was the first to theorise about it, arguing that there was a sort of animateness in seemingly inanimate objects. But that quote is the sum and total of everything he said about it. It should be pointed out that the surviving writings of Aristotle - writing centuries after Thales and centuries before Laertius - only mention Thales arguing from the magnet rather than from both amber and the magnet. And because the text by Hippias that Laertius mentions is also lost, we can't tell whether that discussed Thales theories about electricity in more detail. Nonetheless, Thales probably argued that there is something animate in what are on the surface inanimate objects such as amber; otherwise the effect of static electricity would not occur.
</p>

<p>
In contrast to Laertius' brief mentions of Thales, the Roman writer Pliny The Elder in The Natural History - a sort of encyclopaedia of received wisdom on a variety of topics - discusses amber at length. Pliny points out within his discussion that "when a vivifying heat has been imparted to it by rubbing it between the fingers, amber will attract chaff, dried leaves, and thin bark, just in the same way that the magnet attracts iron".
</p>

<p>
Here Pliny makes a link between the electrical effect of amber and the magnetic effect of certain metals/stones (I discuss pre-modern science conceptions of magnetism here); Thales probably made the same link, if Laertius's sources are accurate. Elsewhere in his writing, Pliny The Elder also discusses electrical discharge in relation to fish:
</p>

<p>
The torpedo is very well aware of the extent of its own powers, and that, too, although it experiences no benumbing effects from them itself. Lying concealed in the mud, it awaits the approach of the fish, and, at the moment that they are swimming above in supposed security, communicates the shock, and instantly darts upon them.
</p>

<p>
Pliny The Elder makes no attempt to explain the powers of the common torpedo here; he merely describes them as a prelude to pointing out how good torpedo liver tastes.
</p>

<p>
A few other ancient writers also discuss the torpedo. Plutarch says in De Sollertia Animalium that:
</p>

<p>
You know, of course, the property of the torpedo: not only does it paralyse all those who touch it, but even through the net it creates a heavy numbness in the hands of trawlers. And some who have experimented further with it report that, if it is washed ashore alive and you pour water upon it from above, you may perceive a numbness mounting to the hand and dulling your sense of touch by way of the water which, so it seems, suffers a change and is first infected. Having, therefore, an innate sense of this power, it never makes a frontal attack or endangers itself; rather, it swims in a circle around its prey and discharges its effluvia as if they were darts, and thus poisons first the water then through the water the creature which can neither defend itself nor escape, being held fast as if by chains and solidified.
</p>

<p>
There is also a lost text by Diphilus discussed briefly in Athenaeus’s Deipnosophisticae:
</p>

<p>
In his commentary on Nicander’s Theriaca, Diphilus of Laodicea says that not the entire body of the animal produces the numbness but only a part of it. He alleges that he has arrived at this conclusion on the basis of many experiments.
</p>

<p>
(Plutarch’s reference to ‘some who have experimented further with it’ may also be a reference to Diphilus)
</p>

<p>
Generally, as can be seen above, ancient writers don't really try to explain occurrences that we’d now understand as electricity. Our surviving references to electrical phenomena mostly just report them and marvel at them (I’ve quoted the ancient writers’ entire statements on electricity above - that’s as much detail as they went into). But perhaps we can get a window into how they implicitly thought electrical phenomena worked by looking at how they used their knowledge of amber and torpedos. And, well, what Pliny says about how to use torpedos does quite clearly suggest that he believed that their electrical abilities were essentially magical - there wasn't any obvious mechanism by which the torpedo could stun other fish, so it was probably magic.
</p>

<p>
Specifically, the Natural History mentions various remedies that use the magical powers of torpedo. One hair removal remedy that Pliny discusses is ‘the brain of the torpedo applied with alum on the sixteenth day of the moon’. Additionally, if a torpedo is caught while the moon is in Libra and kept alive in the birthing room of a pregnant woman, Pliny believes that it makes childbirth easier. Note the way that both remedies involve the movements of the heavens in ways that sound like astrology to us. But remember that, from their point of view, if rays like the torpedo can affect other creatures at a distance in the water, why shouldn’t the movement of the moon also affect creatures at a distance?
</p>

<p>
Finally, Pliny claims that excessive sexual craving can be dulled if the ‘gall of the torpedo, while it is still alive, [is] applied to the genitals’. Well, that one doesn't rely on the movement of the heavens, and...well, I can see how applying electricity to the genitals may cause some people to rapidly lose interest in sex. Some people, anyway.
