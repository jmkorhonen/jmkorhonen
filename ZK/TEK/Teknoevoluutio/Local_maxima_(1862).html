Incremental and Radical Innovation: <br>
Design Research vs. Technology and Meaning Change <br>

<p>
Incremental and Radical Innovation: A Response by John Z Langrish.
</p>

<p>
I found the paper on Incremental and Radical Innovation (Norman &amp; Verganti, Winter 2014. 78-96) to be very interesting but also puzzling - why do the authors make no reference to the concept of local maxima as it occurs in evolutionary biology?
</p>

<p>
The basic idea is that in searching for better ways of existing and propagating, entities can climb up a hill of gradual improvement until they reach the top where further small changes will only move downwards. The hilltop is called a local maximum because there may be other peaks that are higher but how can you reach these other peaks?
</p>

<p>
This idea has been around in for more than 100 years and is not just limited to the academic literature. Richard Dawkins’ book, Climbing Mount Improbable, provides a popular account in which there is a mount with a steep cliff face, almost impossible to climb.1 Out of sight, however, is a sloping path that reaches the top in gradual steps.
</p>

<p>
<b>The idea of local maxima in human design cropped up in 1862 when Eilert Sundt (1817-1875), a Norwegian sociologist, visited England and was impressed by Charles Darwin</b>. He wrote a paper giving a Darwinian model of gradual technical change involving accidental changes, perceived improvements, choice etc. In his <b>account of shipbuilding</b>, he concludes with the idea of experiment.<br>
<div style='padding-left: 30pt'>
“when the idea of new and improved forms had first been aroused, then a long series of prudent experiments, each involving extremely small changes, could lead to the happy result that from the boat constructor’s shed there emerged a boat whose like all would desire.”
</div>
</p>

<p>
This gradual series of changes comes to a stop when,  <br>
“Each kind of improvement has progressed to the point where further developments would entail defects that would more than offset the advantage.” 2
</p>

<p>
The problem of getting stuck on a point had to be tackled by evolutionary theorists and maybe the reason for the authors ignoring their ideas is that they come to different conclusions.<br>
Norman &amp; Verganti claim that radical innovation needs a different mechanism from the gradual climbing of a slope but Darwinian theorists don’t agree.
</p>

<p>
In ‘Origin’, Darwin wrote -<br>
"If it could be demonstrated that any complex organ existed which could not possibly have been formed by numerous successive, slight modifications my theory would absolutely break down." 3
</p>

<p>
You can’t be much clearer than that. <b>For ‘complex organ’ substitute ‘complex system’ or ‘radical innovation’</b> and it becomes obvious that <b>Darwinians have to find a way out of being stuck on a peak</b>. In fact, there are many ways out.
</p>

<p>
<ol type="1" start="1">
<li>The ridge. Something that seems to be a peak when viewed from one side may actually be connected to another apparent peak by a ‘ridge’, allowing movement from one peak to another.</li>
<li>Symbiosis. Entities that have climbed different peaks may find a ridge that enables them to get together; this is what philosopher Daniel Dennett calls the improvement of an entity through joining with something ‘designed elsewhere’ ie it has climbed up a different slope.</li>
<li>Twin peaks. Entities climbing up a slope of improvement may find that further advances lead in different directions so that they end up on different peaks. This is how evolutionary biology proceeds with one species dividing into two or many new species. Common ancestry can also be found in technological change. An entity stuck on a peak may be overtaken by a ‘cousin’ climbing a different and higher peak.</li>
<li>Change in the landscape. Changes in the ‘rules’ of competition can be visualised as a geographic upheaval. At one time the major upward direction for aircraft was speed. Concorde got stuck at the top of this peak. It was the fastest but not the ‘best’. The landscape had changed with cost per passenger being the dominating peak. Major upheavals can be compared with the arrival of a new volcanic island emerging out of the sea. Steam engines and the internal combustion engine were new to the scene but they emerged slowly and developed many ridges to existing peaks.</li>
<li>Any new form of living entity or artefact arrives via a series of small steps. In the real world, there are many more dimensions than in the simple geological metaphor. More dimensions increase the probability of connections between peaks. 4                                                                                                                                               </li>
</ol>
I am aware that the size of technological change is important and way back in 1970 I devised a scale for the size of a technological innovation. This was a five-point scale based on the change required in a standard technical textbook. Size five represented the need for a new book and size four meant a new chapter in the textbook. From a study of British innovations that had gained the Queen’s Award for Industrial Innovation, I obtained evidence that sizes four and five seemed to happen in different ways from those with smaller changes. 5  However, even these large changes had gradually climbed up their own historical peaks and continued to climb once they had combined with other things. <br>
George Basalla’s classic study, The Evolution of Technology attempts to demonstrate the continuity of all technology right back to the use of the first stones and flints, “every new artefact is based to some degree upon a related existing artefact”. Even the transistor climbed out of earlier solid-state amplifiers, used in the ‘crystal’ radio sets.6
</p>

<p>
As Norman &amp; Verganti rightly state, <br>
“a completely novel innovation is impossible. All ideas have predecessors and are always based on previous work - sometimes through refinement, sometimes through a novel combination of several pre-existing ideas.” <br>
This being so, where then is radical innovation and how is it different from hill climbing in a rugged terrain with many peaks connected by ridges? Perhaps it is a matter of semantics with radical not meaning very radical or perhaps it is a reluctance to follow the Darwinian path up the hill of explanations of innovation.<br>
By seeming to support the idea that some innovations are not obtained by gradual hill climbing, they are in danger of giving support to the so-called intelligent design movement. This offshoot of the creationists seeks to show the impossibility of some biological innovations being the result of Darwinian gradual change. “What is the use of half a wing?” etc. (The fossil record shows that both ‘wings’ and feathers existed before they were used for flight - birds bodies are covered in feathers - not just their wings.) Many apparently radical innovations in both biology and in technology can be shown to make use of previously existing systems that were used for a different purpose.<br>
Given Norman &amp; Verganti’s claim that “a completely novel innovation is impossible”, why don’t they stick with Darwin? They claim, “All ideas have predecessors” and ideas can form the basis of a Darwinian approach to design. Ideas can be thought of as memes - imperfect replicators - existing as electro-chemical neuronal patterns in the brain. A previous paper in this journal shows that different types of memes can be used in discussing Darwinian design. Norman &amp; Verganti’s two dimensions of technology and meaning can be thought of two kinds of memes - recipemes, ideas about how to do things, and selectemes ideas about what sort of things you want to do. The desire to travel faster is a selecteme; the idea of supersonic transport is a recipeme. 7<br>
I don’t believe that Norman &amp; Verganti are closet creationists and I don’t believe that they are ignorant of biological ideas of local maxima. So why do they omit any mention of biological maxima and why do they want to insist that radical innovations don’t arrive through a series of small changes?
