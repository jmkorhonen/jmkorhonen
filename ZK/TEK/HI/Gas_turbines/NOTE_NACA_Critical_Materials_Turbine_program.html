I've been slowly wading through the history of turbine development, and this week stumbled across a rather fascinating, if abandoned, line of development. In around 1950, NACA apparently put some serious effort into developing design solutions for "mobilization" turbojets that could be built with non-strategic materials, i.e. with as little columbium, chromium, nickel and tungsten as possible. They concluded that turbine inlet temperatures of up to 1670°K were feasible with non-strategic materials and proper cooling.
</p>

<p>
See below for choice NACA reports; but because I'm lazy and haven't yet read much about NACA history, are there people who are versed in NACA, and can you enlighten us about the program, perhaps even give hints about further sources? I might be able to do some archival digs in the future, and unless this program has already been covered somewhere, it sounds like an interesting little project.

[i]Application of Blade Cooling to Gas Turbines[/i] (1950)<br>
<a href="http://naca.central.cranfield.ac.uk/reports/1950/naca-rm-e50a04.pdf" title="http://naca.central.cranfield.ac.uk/reports/1950/naca-rm-e50a04.pdf" class="http">http://naca.central.cranfield.ac.uk/reports/1950/naca-rm-e50a04.pdf</a>
</p>

<p>
Reviews the status of knowledge on turbine-blade cooling and a describes pertinent NACA investigations. Discusses the possibilities when nonstrategic blade materials are used. Concludes that the application of nonstrategic materials is feasible for turbine-inlet temperatures up to 3000°R [1670°K] (effective gas temperature of about 2750°R [1530°K]). Note: a water-cooled 148-T aluminium alloy turbine was operated for more than 30 hours at TIT between 1145°K and 1420°K!
</p>

<p>
from p.8:
</p>

<p>
"A problem of grave strategic importance is the high percentage of very scarce costly alloys in these [currently available turbine] materials and, in addition, some of the alloys must be imported from other countries. In the event of war, grave doubt exists that enough of these materials could be supplied to manufacture the number of engines required by a greatly expanded air force. As a consequence, substitute metals would have to be used, resulting in an uncooled turbine of a lower specific thrust than is currently obtained because the operating gas temperature would have to be decreased and consequently a larger engine would be necessary to keep the thrust constant at its present value.
</p>

<p>
The most critical elements in order of importance are: cobalt, columbium, chromium, nickel and tungsten. If materials containing cobalt and not more than 0.5-percent columbium are eliminated, most of the familiar high-temperature materials would be unavailable. These materials are N-155, K42B, S-590, S-816, Vitallium, X-40, Inconel X, and many others. The high-temperature alloys then remaining are 19-9 W-Mo, 19-9 DL, 16-25-6, Hastelloy B, Inconel, Discaloy, Nimonic 80, and 17W. With the exception of Hastelloy B, these materials all require from 10- to 20-percent chromium, which is third on the critical list, and up to 75-percent nickel, which is fourth. If it is further specified that the alloy contain not more than 40-percent chromium plus nickel, Nimonic 80, Inconel, and Hastelloy B are eliminated and the following materials remain: 16-25-6, 19-9 DL, 19-9 W-Mo, Discaloy, and 17W. These materials constitute a class of relatively nonstrategic alloys, which could probably be broadened with further development. Chromium content can be further reduced with addition of silicon and titanium in small quantities and nickel can be reduced with addition of molybdenum, which is lower on the critical list. Typical of these reduced materials are the steam-turbine alloys such as Sichrome No. 1, with 8.5-percent chromium, 3-percent silicon, 0-6-percent manganese, and no nickel.
</p>

<p>
Only materials having not more than 4- or 5-percent total strategic-alloy content should practically be considered. The most important problem is therefore to find some means of using such materials without effecting a decrease in turbine-inlet temperature below its present value or preferably with an increase in this temperature above its present value to obtain the specific power increases desired.

[i]Experimental Investigation of Air-Cooled Turbine Blades in Turbojet Engine<br>
IX - Evaluation of the Durability of Noncritical Rotor Blades in Engine Operation[/i] (1951)<br>

</p>

<p>
A Timken 17-22A(S) alloy steel blade completed 200 cycles of operation (50 h at rated speed), which was considered sufficient to demonstrate the durability of the type of blade from a structural and cooling standpoint. The blade remained in good condition, except for considerable oxidation at the leading and trailing edges. The endurance investigation on a SAE 4130 steel blade was terminated after 154 cycles (38,5 h at rated speed) because of severe oxidation. The investigation indicates that air-cooled rotor blades made of noncritical materials can be operated for extended periods of time at current turbine-inlet temperatures and engine speeds and can withstand repeated thermal shock. However, coatings or other means to limit oxidation are required. (Note: noncritical blade materials are considered to be those that contain no more than 5% of critical alloying elements.
